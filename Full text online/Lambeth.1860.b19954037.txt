METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. 18th & 19th Victoria, Cap. 120. The Destry of the Parish of Mary Lambeth FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT. In accordance with the 198th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," the Vestry have to report their proceedings under such Act, and of the Works completed during the year, ending the 25th day of March, 1861. During the year various works have been executed, Improvements effected, and Public Lighting increased, in relation to which the Vestry have been actuated and governed by the same desire as that expressed in the Reports of previous years, namely, to extend the benefits thereof over the whole Parish, and to render any serious increase of local taxation unnecessary. The Works and Improvements referred to are hereafter specifically described under the respective heads of Sewerage, and Street and House Drainage Works, &c., at page 4; Sanitary matters at page 7; Highways, New Works, and Improvements at page 15; and Lighting matters at page 18. The Report also contains an Account in Abstract, showing the Receipt and Expenditure of the Vestry for the year at Lady-Day last; and also a Summary Statements of all Contracts entered into, and of monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by the Vestry. These Accounts have been 4 duly audited, and allowed by the Auditors elected by the Parishioners. For the purpose of efficient publication, it was determined, by Resolution of Vestry passed at a Meeting held on the 9th day of May, 1861, that the Accounts of the Lambeth Burial Board should be printed in this Report. To give effect to such direction, an Abstract Account of amounts received and paid by the said Board from the 25th day of March, 1860, to 24th day of March, 1861, is set forth at page 40. The Accounts of the said Board have been duly audited, as evidenced by the certificate appended thereto. SEWERAGE, HOUSE DRAINAGE WORKS, &c. In consequence of the progress made with works of this description during the preceding years of the Vestry's operations, the result of last year is by comparison small, and it is rendered less by the course consistently pursued by the Vestry to avoid doing anything not of a permanent character, or which would not accord with and work into the main scheme of Drainage in course of construction by the Metropolitan Board of Works. With but very few exceptions all the Sewers remaining to be constructed will discharge into the new main lines; and until they are completed, and have a clear outlet or discharge, but little more can be done in the Parish, This cause has prevented several works which were determined upon, so long since as the last Report, being carried out up to the present time. The plans of what will be necessary have however been well considered, so that as soon as the opportunity occurs for carrying them out, no time will be lost. 5 The New Sewers executed during the past year are in Meadow Road 200-ft. 12-in. Pipe. Stock well Estate 596-ft. 3-ft. by 2-ft. Brick Sewer, 750 ft. 12-in. Pipe. Mawbey Estate G7G-ft. 24-in. Brick Sewer, 1,796-ft. 12-in. Pipe. Norwood Open Sewer 670-ft. 24-in. Brick Barrel. Jeffrey's Road, Clapham.l,400-ft. 3-ft. by 2-ft. Brick. In these works the greater part of the cost has been defrayed by the owners, or those interested in the property. Repairs and General Works, during the past year, as previously, include the repair and maintenance of the Sewers and Drains, and comprise items mainly of small amount. Flushing and Cleansing has been carried out during the year with satisfactory results, the whole of the Sewers, both covered and open, are in as good condition as existing circumstances will allow. Complaints of flooding, and other annoyances arising from stoppages or defects in drainage have been promptly examined and remedied where the duty of doing so, has been with the Vestry. House Drainage.—197 applications have been made during the year for the drainage of 358 houses. The amount paid into the office upon applications for connexion with the Sewers is £651 14s. 4d., and the estimated cost of the private work done at the expense of applicants is £3,750, all of which has been executed under the personal inspection and supervision of the officers of the Vestry. New Streets.—The approval of the Metropolitan Board has been given to the formation of several new Streets during the past year, by which an increase has been made in the number of houses and value of rateable property in the Parish, 0 and greater addition will occur as the ground gets covered. The principal places are:— Rosetta Street, Wandsworth Road. John Street „ Elder Road, Norwood. Mawbey Estate, South Lambeth. Stockwell F state. William Street, Wandsworth Road. Slades Estate, Loughborough Road. New Buildings.—The Vestry has received notices for building 124 new houses, the drainage of which and the levels of the lowest floors have been considered and approved by the Vestry, as the Act directs. Thirty-two Applications have been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for leave to bring out frontages, and referred to the Vestry, and reported upon by them. These matters have always had full consideration, and the recommendations made by the Vestry have, in most cases, been adopted. 7 SANITARY MATTERS. Between March 25th, 1800, and March 25th, 1861, there were 2,600 cases of nuisance brought under the notice of the General Purposes Committee, by the Medical Officer and Inspectors. 1,666 of these cases referred to the state of dwelling houses rendered unwholesome by reason of their filthy and dilapidated condition, or their foul cesspools, or their defective drains. The particulars of these, and of the remaining cases, are shown in the accompanying Table, No. I. The general sanitary state of the parish, as indicated by its mortality in the year 1860, is shown in the following Table, No. II., which gives the total number of births, the total number of deaths, the deaths under five years of age, and the deaths in the workhouses, which occurred in the entire parish, and in each of its eight sub-divisions, during the entire year, and during each particular quarter of the year.

Diarrhoœa, scarlatina, and typhus underwent a striking diminution. In 1859, the fatal cases of diarrhoea, which were by no means unusually numerous, amounted to 160, but in the past year they sunk down to 89. The fatal scarlatina cases decreased from 297 in 1859, to 158 in 1860 ; and the fatal typhus cases from 120 in 1859, to 70 in 1860. In order to ascertain the death rate of Lambeth in the year 1860, it is necessary first to know its population. The amount of population in previous years has been estimated upon the assumption that the average rate of increase which subsisted between 1841 and 1851 still prevailed. But the census of 1861, has shown, as was of course expected, that the assumption did not accord altogether with the fact. The population of 1860, therefore, has been calculated upon the average rate of increase which existed between 1851 and 1861, and the result may be considered as a close approximation to the truth. But it cannot be exact, because while the actual population of Lambeth increases every year, the per-centage rate of increase diminishes. Thus in the 10 years, or rather 98137 years, between the 1841 and 1851 census, the population of Lambeth increased by 23,253 souls ; whereas, during the 10 years, or rather 10.0219 years, between the 1851 and 1861 census, it increased by only 22,683 souls; and inasmuch as the former increase has to be calculated upon a population of 116 thousand, and the latter upon a population of 139 thousand, the per-centage rate of increase is considerably higher in the former period than in the latter, as shown in the following table. Seeing then, that the rate of increase decreases every year, the population of 1860 calculated upon the average rate of increase between 1851 and 1861 will be somewhat overestimated. 12 TABLE IV.

But the actual increase of population being 22,683, the difference in the two numbers, or 2799, represents the excess of imported above exported population. According to the 1861 census, the number of persons to a house throughout Lambeth is almost exactly 7. During the 1841—51 period the number of inhabited houses increased by 2,656, i.e. from 17,791 to 20,447; or in other words, an additional house to every 8f persons. During the 1851—61 period, the number of inhabited houses increased by 2,554, ie. from 20,447 to 23,001; but this somewhat smaller increase nevertheless corresponds to one additional house for every 8 persons. In accordance with the results of previous years, the death rate of Lambeth in the past year 1860, was considerably lower * The actual populations of Lambeth and the South Districts, returned in the 1841 census, were 115,888 and 502,548 respectively. They have been increased to 110,072 and 503,346 respectively to make allowance for the Police on duty, who in that particular census were not returned in districts. The rate of increase in the 1841—51 period has been calculated from the formula 13 than that of London, and than that of the South districts of London among which it is situated, as shewn in the following Table. TABLE V. DISTRICTS. Estimated Population in 1860. Deaths in 1860. Death rate per 10,000. Living to one Death. LAMBETH 160,182 3,280 204.7 48.8 SOUTH DISTRICTS 761,236 16,701 210.1 45.6 LONDON 2,767,360 61,821 223.3 44.7 The death rates of last year, not only in Lambeth and London, but throughout the kingdom, were unusually low; and this diminution of mortality was doubtless correlated with the climate of the year. The mean temperature of the atmosphere was 47.0 degrees, and its dryness 4.6 degrees, while the rainfall amounted to 32.0 inches. Not one of the last twenty years exceeded the past year in the three points of temperature, highness of moisture for the temperature, and quantity of rainfall. The year which corresponded most closely to it in its average features was 1841, in which the mean temperature was 48.7 degrees, the dryness 5 0 degrees, and the rainfall 33.3 inches. The year 1852 also exceeded it in the quantity of its rainfall, which amounted to 34.8 inches, but the mean temperature of that year was very high, namely, 50.6 degrees, as was also the dryness of the atmosphere, namely 7.0 degrees. Owing to the abundant rainfall of the autumn of 1859, and the winter of 1859—60, the river Thames was in the early summer of 1860 full of fresh water, and scarcely in a condition to become very objectionable, even if a dry and hot season had supervened. The Lambeth Vestry therefore opposed 14 themselves strongly to a project of the Metropolitan Board for expending some twenty thousand pounds upon a deodorising experiment with per chloride of Iron. They argued that the sanitary evils resulting from the river stench in 1859 had not been well marked, that the occurrence of the stench in 1860 was very problematical, while the prevention of the stench by the means proposed was still more so. In consequence of the summer proving to be one of the coolest and wettest on record, the river did not become at any time offensive, a result fully justifying the protest of the Vestry against an enormous expenditure, which the character of the season, of itself, rendered quite unnecessary. 15 REPAIRS TO HIGHWAYS, NEW WORKS, AND IMPROVEMENTS. General Repairs.—The whole of the Roads and Streets under the charge of the Vestry have been, from time to time, repaired by the staff employed, and with the materials best suited to their several circumstances and localities. Watering and Cleansing have been carried out as heretofore by contract; and to render more efficient the former work the wells in St. Ann's Road and Cold Harbour Lane have been deepened, so as to increase the supply ; and an entirely new well has been sunk at Stockwell Green, to a depth of 225 feet, by which the annual cost of a supply from the Water Company is saved for a considerable length of road. The Main Drainage Works have much affected the water level for a great distance on either side of their course, and in most cases it will be found necessary to lower the wells. NEW WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS. The following Works have been carried out during the past year, upon the recommendation of the General Purposes Committee, being approved by the Vestry. Stockwell Green.—Old kerb reset, and footway taken up and relaid with new 2½-in. York paving. Trinity Square.—Footpaths and carriage-way reformed, regulated, and faced with Croydon gravel and flints, the sum of £70 being contributed by the owners. Westminster Road.—Old kerb reset and jointed, and new 3-in. York laid. Stangate.—New 2½-in. York laid to footway in lieu of asphalte, and at the corner of Palace New Road, and 7-in. by 4-in.

Little Cornwall Road.—New 12-in. by 8-in. flat kerb laid on west side, and footway paved with new 2½-in. York, and footway on east side relaid and made good. George Street, Princes Road.—New Purbeck kerb, and 4-ft. course of new 2½-in. York, laid on west side, and made up with gravel. Granby Street.—New 12-in. by 6-in. granite kerb, and new 2½-in. York paving, on both sides. Regent Street.—New 12-in. by 6-in. flat granite kerb and footway, relaid and made good. Devonshire Place.—Kerb reset, and new 2^-in. York laid on west side. High Street, Lambeth.—Kerb and footway relaid and made good. Anderson's Walk.—Footway taken up and relaid. Gloucester Street, Vauxhall Road.—The carriage way formed, and coated with flints. New 12-in. by 8-in. granite kerb, laid on both sides, and the footways made up and gravelled. Carlisle Lane and Street.—Footways repaired in places with new 12-in. by 8-in. granite kerb, and 2½-in. York, and the old paving relaid throughout. 17 Knight's Hill & Park Road, Norwood.—New Purbeck kerb laid, and footways regulated. Robert Street, Brixton.—New Purbeck kerb laid, and 4-ft. course of new 2½-in. York, on north side. Camberwell Green.—Paving, relaid, and made good with new 2½-in. York, where required. New Roads.—During the past year the following additional roads have devolved upon the Vestry to maintain and repair:— St. John's Road. Wiltshire Road. Angel Road. Trinity Roads and Square. New Lines of Railway.—The Charing Cross Railway Company, and the London, Dover, and Chatham Railway Company, have commenced carrying out the works for which they have obtained powers by Act of Parliament. In both these Acts special clauses of importance have been inserted for the protection of the public interest. And the consent of the Vestry has been given to Mr. Train, to construct his Street Railway from "The Horns" to Westminster Bridge. r> 18 LIGHTING. During the past year 43 memorials have been received for improved lighting in various parts of the parish, 30 of which were acceded to, by the erection of new columns or removals, and 13 refused. There have been 23 new lamps erected, 11 lamps discontinued, 5 columns substituted for brackets, and 28 lamps removed for purposes of improvement. The total number of lamps lighted by the Vestry at the present time is 2,226; and the cost of lighting, including the removal of lamps, and sundry expenses for the year ended the 25th day of March last, amounted to £10,548 0s. 1d. In several preceding Reports reference has been made to the districting arrangements of the Gas Companies, and to the measures promoted in Parliament by the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, with a view of regulating the quality and price of Gas, and to protect the consumers from any disadvantage to which they were exposed by reason of the monopoly resulting from the combination of the Companies. In the last Session of Parliament an Act was passed, entitled "The Metropolis Gas Act, 1860," regulating the Companies' charge for Gas, and fixing its illuminating power at twelve sperm candles, and containing many other proviions of a beneficial nature to the gas consumer. The Vestry has appointed Dr. Odling the Chemical Examiner of Gas, and monthly reports are presented by him on its illuminating power and purity, from which it appears that during the past year the quality of the Gas has been improved. Since the passing of the Act the Phoenix Gas Company has reduced its price 3d. per 1,000 ft. to consumers north of Kennington Church, and 9d. per 1,000 ft. south of that point, to nearly the whole extent of the Parish. 19 The price paid for lighting the public lamps continues the same as last year, with the exception of the Phoenix Company, whose charge has been reduced for lamps south of Kennington Church, from £4 15s. per lamp per annum to £4 10s., effecting an annual saving to the Vestry of about £170 per annum.
