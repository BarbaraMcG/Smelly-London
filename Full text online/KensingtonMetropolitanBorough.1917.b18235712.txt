KEN 21 The Royal Borough of Kensington. ANNUAL REPORT (ABRIDGED) OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. 1917. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Royal Borough of Kensington. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen.— I have the honour to submit the Aunual Report of the Medical Officer of Health, which contains, in accordance with the Regulations of the Local Government Board, a summary of the action taken for the prevention of disease, and an account of the sanitary state of the Royal Borough during the year 1917. In May, 1917, Dr. J. E. Sandilands, your Medical Officer of Health, who had resumed his duties in the autumn of 1916, again proceeded on active military service in the field, and at the request of your Council I was invited again to become Acting Medical Officer of Health during Dr. Sandilands' absence. I regret to have to report that Mr. Charles Sydney Sewell, who had been a clerk in the Public Health Department for 16 years, died early in May, 1917, from wounds received whilst on military service in France. The work of the Department has been carried on with its usual efficiency, and Mr. Pettit, the Chief Sanitary Inspector. and the District Sanitary Inspectors lent willing aid to the work of Local Food Control during the latter half of the year under review. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, LOUIS C. PARKES. June, 1918. 1 VITAL STATISTICS Population.—To meet the diminution and abnormal constitution of the population caused by the war, the Registrar-General has estimated the population of Kensington in 1917 as 168,919 for the purpose of calculating the birth rate, and as 151,535 for the calculation of death rates.

The populations for the various districts in the Borough have been in each case arrived at by multiplying the census population of the district by the second factor to obtain the death rate population shown in the first column of the table, headed "D," and by the first factor, .9803, to obtain the birth rate population in the second column, which is headed "B." Births.—The number of births registered was 2,378, after correction for inward and outward transfers. Distributed according to sex and legitimacy the births were as follows:— Male. Female. Total. Legitimate 1,137 1,094 2,231 Illegitimate 80 67 147 Total 1,217 1,161 2,378 The birth rate for the Borough was 14.8 per 1,000 as compared with a rate of 20.0 in the decennium 1901-10. 2 Notification of Births.—Of the registered births 2,201 occurred in Kensington, and of this number 1,984, or 90 per cent., were notified to the Medical Officer of Health within 36 hours, or at most a few days after their occurrence. The total number of births notified, including still births which are not registerable, was 2,225. Details are given in the following Table:— Source of Notification. Number of Births Notified.

The mortality in the several wards has already been shown in Table A. The principal causes of death in the several age periods of life are set out in Table III., Appendix. Infantile Mortality.—The deaths among infants under the age of one year numbered 309, the infantile mortality rate being equivalent to 130 per 1,000 births. The following Table shows the mortality among infants in the several wards:— Table B. INFANTILE MORTALITY District. Deaths under one year. Deaths per 1,000 Births.

The same table shows that the mortality amongst illegitimate infants, of whom no less than 60 died, was equivalent to a rate of 408 per 1,000, as compared with a rate of 112 per 1,000 among those born in wedlock. 3 Health Visitors.—The Health Visitors visit infants notified under the Notification of Births Act, cases of ophthalmia in the newly born, infants suffering from tuberculosis and notified cases of puerperal fever. They assist in the work of the voluntary schools for mothers. During the year 2,324 infants were visited shortly after birth and 7,740 visits in all for the purposes mentioned above and enquiries into the large number of cases of measles notified during the year.

Milkshops—At the end of the year there remained on the Council's Register 190 premises where milk was sold. Of these premises 125 were milkshops, 32 were general shops and 33 were restaurants. Cowsheds.—The licence, of the only cowshed in the Borough was renewed by the London County Council for ten cows. The number kept does not as a rule exceed four. Ice-cream.—At the end of the year 190 premises were shown in the Register of places where ice-cream is prepared or sold as compared with 188 premises at the end of the preceding year. Bakehouses.—There are 87 bakehouses in the Borough, and of this number 65 are underground. Slaughter-houses.—Six slaughter-houses were licensed by the London County Council in October. Special conditions as to notice and hours of slaughtering attach, as reported in 1916, to the licence of the house in the Walmer Road, where a considerable number of pigs are killed. Other Premises Used for Sale, &c., of Food.—These premises are entered in a Register under the date on which they were finally inspected and found to comply as regards structure with the sanitary regulations in S. 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. At the end of the year the following shops or premises remained on the Register, namely:— Provision Dealers. Restaurants. Butchers' Shops. Fried Fish Shops. Fishmongers. Greengrocers. Other Shops. 279 166 97 26 54 97 15 Unsound Food—The unsound food surrendered and destroyed during the year is shown in the following list:— Cheese (Government) 1 Cheese (lbs.) 95 Herrings (boxes) 2 Potatoes (bags) 30 Swedes (cwts.) 9 Dripping (lbs.) 3 Corned Beef (tin) 1 Pigs' carcase and organs (tuberculosis) 4 Pigs' heads (tuberculosis) 18 Pig's pluck (inflammation of lungs) 1 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—During the year the Sanitary Inspectors collected 699 samples under the above Acts and submitted them to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of the samples submitted 45, or 6 per cent., were reported as adulterated. Proceedings were taken in 18 cases for adulteration or other offences, the fines and costs inflicted amounting to £26 2s. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. Lodgings provided by the Council.—The Council provide within the Borough 120 tenements of one, two, or three rooms for the working classes. Latterly all the Council's tenements have been let. Houses Let in Lodgings.—The number of houses let in lodgings on the Council's register at the end of the year was 2,065. In 1913, 187 of the registered houses were let in furnished lodgings at a charge of 1s. per night per room. The lodgings in the remainder of the registered houses are let unfurnished. The inspections and re-inspections of lodging houses numbered 7,459. Notices requiring the remedy of defects found were served in 492 instances, and 2 cases of overcrowding were abated. The owners of four lodging houses were summoned for failing to carry out sanitary repairs and for breach of by-laws for houses let in lodgings. 891 houses were reported as having been cleansed in accordance with the requirements of By-Law 16. Common Lodging Houses.—The Common Lodging Houses in the Borough number 20 and contain accommodation for some 627 persons. Eleven are for male and 9 for female lodgers. Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910.—The house-to-house inspections for the purpose of these Regulations and the detection of nuisances numbered 731. This figure does not include re-inspections, inspections on complaint or inspections of registered lodging houses for the purpose of enforcing the lodging house by-laws. In accordance with the directions in the Local Government Board Circular of 4th August, 1915, only urgently necessary work has been required, with the result that it has not been possible to proceed with the scheme of housing work which had been instituted on the lines laid down in the regulations. 6 Closing Orders.—The Closing Order in respect of No. 98, Southam Street was determined on July 3rd, 1917, the premises having been rendered fit for human habitation. Inland Revenue Acts.—Under these Acts 37 certificates were issued by the Medical Officer of Health, in respect to 107 tenements in 43 houses containing a total number of 108 separate dwellings. Water Supply to New Houses.—No inspections of newly erected houses were made during the year for the purpose of certification before occupation as having a proper and sufficient supply of water. Remedy of Defects.—A tabular statement showing in detail the work carried out under the direction of the Sanitary Inspectors for the remedy of various sanitary defects in dwelling houses is entered month by month and for the year in the registers of the Public Health Department. The registers are available for reference and render the publication of a detailed statement in the Annual Report unnecessary. In eight cases legal proceedings were instituted against persons who had failed to comply with the sanitary requirements of the inspectors. In each case an order was made by the Justices for the work required to be carried out. Fines amounting to £17 were inflicted. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The Council is required to keep a register of workshops and is responsible for the sanitary conditions of all workshops and workplaces in the Borough. For the sanitary condition of factories the Home Office is directly responsible, the duties of the Council in factories being limited to securing the provision of suitable and sufficient sanitary conveniences for the persons employed. Where women are employed the inspections are made by the Council's Lady Sanitary Inspector. The following list shows the number of workshops and factories in the Borough.

The same return in greater detail, showing the number of inspections made, the sanitary notices issued and the sanitary works completed, is available for reference in registers kept for the purpose in the Public Health Department. Lady Sanitary Inpector.—A summary of the monthly reports shows that the Lady Sanitary Inspector who worked single handed during the year (Miss de Chaumont up to the end of July, when she rejoined the Nursing Service, and Miss Bennett since her appointment in the middle of September) paid in all 2,204 visits—512 to factories and workshops, 608 to cases of tuberculosis, 931 to cases of measles and whooping cough, and 153 for other purposes. Disinfection.—The disinfecting staff disinfected 1,297 rooms in 1,011 tenements or dwelling houses. The bedding from 744 households was disinfected by steam or by washing and boiling at the disinfecting station at Wood Lane. The number and weight of the articles dealt with was as follows:— Articles disinfected only 8,217 Articles disinfected and washed 887 Total number of articles 9,104 Total weight of articles 28 tons 5 cwt. Verminous Persons.—The following tables shows the number of persons dealt with at the Council's Cleansing Station during the year:— Children cleansed 1,889 Adults cleansed 131 N umber of baths given 5,109 Verminous Rooms.—296 verminous rooms were cleansed in response to notices, 2 verminous beds were destroyed and 62 dirty beds were cleansed. In addition 128 beds were disinfected by steam at Wood Lane and 96 verminous rooms were fumigated by the Council's disinfecting staff. Rag Flock.—Two samples of rag flock were taken from makers of bedding and submitted for analysis. Both samples complied with the standard of cleanliness laid down by the regulations. Mortuary.—During the year 257 bodies were deposited at the Mortuary. In 131 cases post-mortem examinations were made and 203 bodies were deposited for the holding of inquests at the instance of the coroner. 22 bodies were deposited in the Chapel of Rest. THE FLOODING OF BASEMENTS IN JUNE. On the 16th June a very severe thunderstorm, in which over 4½ inches of rain fell, caused a flooding of basements of unexamp ed severity over a much larger area than in any previous record. The flood area was in the Notting Dale district and involved some of the poorest parts of the Borough. In previous floods the basements were invaded with storm waters from the main sewers, the inundations being measured in inches, but in the storm of June, 1917, the flood level was measured by feet, up to 5 feet or more above the floors of the lowest storeys. The water rose so rapidly that in most cases there was little or no time available tor rescuing furniture and bedding and carrying them to a place of safety. The majority of the families flooded out were able to find temporary accommodation on the upper floors of the houses they occupied or in neighbouring dwellings, but in some instances the families had nowhere where they could go, and had to stay in their flooded-out homes. Fortunately, so far as can be ascertained, little or no injury to health resulted in the flooded areas. This appears to have been mainly attributable to three circumstances, (1) that the storm water quickly subsided, (2) that the water was practically rain water, with only a slight sewage taint, and (3) that the possible injury to health that might be caused by damp surroundings was counteracted by the very high temperature of the air then prevailing. To the poorest class of tenant the most severe loss was that of their bedding. A committee was formed by the Mayor to administer a privately collected fund for the relief of distress, and a large part of the money collected was spent in the provision of new bedding for the poorer class of sufferers. These periodical floodings of the low-lying areas of Kensington will continue to recur until further steps are taken by the London County Council to afford relief for the main sewers of this district, the existing measures of relief so far undertaken being clearly inadequate. The rainfall of the 16th June was, however, of a very exceptional character, and is not likely to recur for many years to come. 8 APPENDIX. Local Government Board Tables I.—IV. TABLE I.
