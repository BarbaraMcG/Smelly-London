THE TENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the St. Sabiour's District Board of Works. RESPECTFULLY PRESENTED TO THE INHABITANTS. The Board of Works for the St. Saviour's District, pursuant to the 198 sect. of the Metropolis Local Management Act, submit their Tenth Annual Report and Abstract of Accounts to the Inhabitants of the District; showing the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board for the twelve months ending on the 25th March. Annexed also are the Annual Reports of their Medical Officer and Surveyor. The Appendices to tho Medical Officer's Report will be found to contain a complete summary of the works of a sanitary description which have been executed under his own coguizauce and that of the Sanitary Inspector. The more important matters which have occupied the attention of the Board and their Officers during the twelve months preceding the date hereof mav be thus stated :— Shortly after the publication of their last Annual Report, the 3 Board made further efforts to induce the Water and Gas Companies to avail themselves of the subway in Southwark Street for the purpose of laying their mains, and solicited the co-operation of the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was cheerfully given; but their joint efforts were unavailing, and water and gas mains have since been laid along the street in trenches. • Another subject in connexion with the water supply has occupied the attention of the District Board, and in which the Vestry of Bermondsey had led the way, namely, the subject of a constant (in lieu of an intermittent) supply. From the evidence afforded by the published correspondence of the Vestry with the Clerks of many of the principal towns in the United Kingdom, and as the result of their own enquiries, the Board came to an unanimous resolution that a constant supply would bo advantageous, but as the question was not likely to be entertained by Parliament during the present session, it would bo inexpedient to proceed further in the matter. The Board, however, are pleased to be able to state that an application made in their behalf to the two Water Companies in May last to afford a supply of water on Sundays as on other days of the week to the courts and alleys within the district, for the benefit of the poorer class of inhabitants, who are for the most part destitute of efficient receptacles to retain water, met with prompt and thorough compliance on the part of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company, and also by the Lambeth Company, restricted to the summer months. 4 Parliamentary Notices and Plans were received for the present session of the following projected railway undertakings :— 1. " The Clapham and London Bridge Railway." 2. "The London, Chatham, and Dover, and South-Eastern Railways, Nos. 1 and 2 "—to Kennington, Clapham, and Brixton. 3. "The London, Chatham, and Dover (various powers)." The first-mentioned scheme was, very shortly after the introduction of the Bill into Parliament, abandoned by the promoters; the second was rejected by a Parliamentary Committee; the third, notwithstanding the joint opposition of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the St. Saviour's Board, and other persons, has been sanctioned. The operation of this Act as regards the St. Saviour's District is confined to the procurement of additional station accommodation, necessitating a widening of the girder bridge which crosses South wark Street, and the absorption of the site of additional houses at the south end of the bridge in the rear of Southwark Street. the Boards, as the result of their joint opposition, have obtained the insertion of clauses stipulating for the lighting, at the expense of the Company, of the roadway under the bridge, and that the bridge shall be made and maintained water-tight as nearly as possible. The Board have appointed throe crossing sweepers, pursuant to section 118 of the 18th and 19th Vict., cap. 120, each of whom is enabled to attend to several crossings. They are stationed in the Borough High Street, Southwark Street, and the Blackfriars Road. The Board have thought it right to give their utmost support to the London (City) Corporation Gas Bill, by potition to Parliament. Several Contracts for Paving, Works, &c., have expired in the course of the twelvemonth, and fresh ones have been entered into, as will be seen on referring to the List of Contracts at page 30. these for Paving are on rather more advantageous terms than the last. A largo amount of outstanding charges against Railway Companies and other persons (over £600), for various Paving and Sewage Works, has been collected in. The alterations and improvements of the Board Room Promises, referred to in the last Annual Report, having been entirely completed, the Board, in February last, resumed occupation of the same. Such of the parishioners of Christchurch and St. Saviour's who may bo desirous of inspecting the renovated promises are invited to do so. During the past year the Board have presented petitions and memorials as under, viz.:—To Parliament, against the Railway Bills above-named: against the Pneumatic Despatch Company's Bill: in favour of the London (City) Corporation Gas Bill: for a modification of the Railway Clauses Bill, 1866.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, To-day I havo the honor to place before you the Tenth Annual Report of tho Sanitary condition of tho Saint Saviour's District; and on tho present occasion tho pleasure of doing so is considerably onhaucod by the consideration that the year 1865 was distinguished by an increased amount of vigilance in tho prosecution of measures for tho prevention of disease, and a very material diminution of sickness and death. During tho past year thoro were causes of disease in operation d from which, if they could havo been foreseen, wo should havo predicted a probable increase of mortality. In largo towns, and especially in districts such as this, tho wear and tear of tho physical frame demand a good supply of animal food. This, from tho almost unprecedented price of meat, tho poor havo been unable to obtain. The first three months of tho year wero unusually cold, and J consequently diseases of tho respiratory organs were at that period very fatal. After that mouth, excepting tho month of August, tho temperaturo was above tho avcrago of 24 years—tho air temperature in September reaching 86 degrees, and the water of tho Thames 68. It is a fact highly encouraging to those engaged in sanitary work that although the intense cold of tho winter added to the mortality of London, the almost tropical heat of the summer produced no sensible effect. From an examination of the Statistical Tables appended it will be observed that there wero 788 deaths registered in this District during the past year. This is a smaller number than has boon registered in any year since tho establishment of this Board, 103 fewer than in tho year preceding, and 148 fewer than the average of the past ten years. Of tho total mortality 22 died in Guy's Hospital, only three of whom previously resided in either parish. There wero also 81 Coroner's Inquests upon bodies of porsons who had been drowned and washed ashoro iu this District, but whoso previous residenco was in other parishes. Nearly tho whole of the deaths in those wards of Guy's Hospital situate in the parish of Saint Saviour wero occasioned by fire. A mortality therefore of about fifty is due to sudden, violent, or accidental causes, which no amount of caution on tho part of District Boards could have prevented. The Table of comparison of mortality according to ago gives an increaso of 18 deaths among infants under ono year old. Of those who were upwards of 80, 29 died—a number exactly corresponding with that of last year. In every other division there was a marked decrease. 8 In the Workhouse there were 84 deaths; being a mortality of 40 loss than in tho year 1864. This must be regarded as a very low death-rate. In my first year of office tho number was 90; and in soveral subsequent years it has been considerably higher. In order to appreciate the full extent of this favorablo result, it must bo observed that, since the erection of a separate building for the sick, the number of pauper patients has increased nearly threefold. Tho Guardians of the Saint Saviour's Union have long been alive to tho necessity of providing for tho comfort and convenience of tho sick poor; and by their sympathy, and ungrudging liberality, have rendered tho Infirmary of tho Workhouso a desirable refugo for tho afflicted. The difference between tho comfort of tho Infirmary and tho sick room outside is an inducement to largo numbers to seek admission who, but a few years sinco, would have been been contented to receivo the medical attendance of tho District Officer, and such conveniences and nursing as their own homes would afford. Taking the population of 1861 as tho basis of calculation, tho mortality of the Saint Saviour's District has been nearly 22 to every thousand living persons; that of tho South Districts 25½, and that of the whole of London 26. After making overy allowance for tho variation of the population sinco tho period of tho last census, it remains incontestiblo that Saint Saviour still maintains a favorablo position in this comparison; and, as it was formerly far otherwiso, there can bo no presumption in claiming for tho labors of this Board some sharo of merit in producing so happy a result. With respect to those diseases which aro peculiarly frequent and fatal in our climate, tho deaths were fewer last year by 24. Tliero was an increase of 26 persons in tho mortality from Phthisis, but a decrease of 50 from other diseases of tho respiratory organs. From Zymotic disease there was a total decreaso of 28 deaths. From Small Pox there was an increaso of 3, from Diarrhoea 6, and as many as 27 from Whooping Cough. But against these there was a decreaso of 1 from Diphtheria, 8 from Measles and 50 from Fever. Excepting in tho case of Whooping Cough, from which cause there was an excessively high mortality, the same law appears to have regulated tho death-rate, from Epidemic Diseaso, throughout tho Metropolis. Tho Births registered in the District during tho year numbored 1,069, being an oxcoss of 281 births over deaths. From tho commencement of the past year another visit of Cholera has been very generally apprehended and dreaded. We have reason to bo grateful, however, that tho year passed away without the realisation of these unpleasant anticipations; and should this fearful scourge yet appear in our midst, it would doubtless bo unattended with that panic which appears to have seized so many communities on the continent of Europo. While little progress 9 has been made in the knowledge of methods of cure, considerable advance has been made in measures of prevention, resulting from more perfect knowledge of the causes of tho disease ; and there are abundant grounds for believing that in any futuro visitation its aravages will bo inconsiderable compared with those of former years. The numerous painstaking investigations which havo been made, from time to time, in different parts of tho country afford conclusive evidenco as to the preponderating influence of impuro water in tho spread of Cholera; and although tho modo of its communication, and its apparent eccentricity, are still subjects involved in some degree of mystery, tho number of facts which havo been adduced appear to lead to tho conclusion that it is not by contagion from tho skin or exhalations from tho lungs but from the virus of tho materia ejected by tho patient being extended chiefly by water. Without referring to tho cumulative evidence obtained from numerous sources by thoso who havo made this subject their study, or giving an unqualified adhesion to any particular theory as to tho medium by which tho morbific matter is conveyed, sufficient may bo gathered from the post of this District alono to justify tho expectation that future visitations will bo less severe. In tho year 1849, when, as far as can now be ascertained, tho organic impurity of the water of this District was about equal in both parishes, tho death-rate of Christchurch was rather higher than that of Saint Saviour. In 1858, when the parish of Christchurch was chiefly supplied by the purer water of tho Lambeth Company, and tho parish of Saint Saviour by that of Vauxhall, tho death-rate from Cholera was fivo times greater in Saint Saviour's than in Christchurch. An enquiry, instituted by tho Board of Health in tho Southern District, extending over the whole of tho Epidemic period of 1858-51, resulted in tho discovery that, among an equal number of customers of cither Company, tho deaths among those of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company were 3½ times moro numerous than among thoso of Lambeth. It should therefore excite no surpriso, that at periods when tho water supply of the South of London was derived almost exclusively from tho Thames at or below Vauxhall, or from wells, in many instances sunk in close proximity to privies and cesspools, tho rato of mortality should havo been so comparatively high. Since the last outbreak of Cholera tho Vauxhall Company havo removed their reservoir to Thames Ditton; tho Thames has been to a very great extent purified; and in Southwark alone, several thousand cesspools have been excavated and filled up. There is an early prospect of tho sewage of London being entirely diverted from tho Thames, and of tho London cosspools being completely exterminated. These are somo of tho circumstances which encourago tho expectation of a milder form of the pestilonco in the future; but it must be remembored that oven water derived from Thames Ditton is 10 for from pure. This portion of the river still serves as a sower for a well manured country, studded with a number of towns whoso population is largo and continually increasing. Unless these sources of impurity are entirely diverted, notwithstanding tho extensive drainage of the Metropolis, the water supplied to London will go on deteriorating till it again reaches its former rate of adulteration. Under tho most favorable conditions it is questionable whether water supplied from the Thames can ever be obtained in a state of purity sufficient for the preservation of health. At present, however, it is pure compared with what it was formerly, and it is desirable that the Legislature should interfere to prevent the Thames being poisoned nearer its source. The inhabitants of tho Metropolis aro now spending enormous sums of money in diverting their drainage from the river, and it is not unreasonable to expect other communities to adopt some efficient, and less injurious, means for disposing of theirs. It is doubtless in tho recollection of tho Board that I have frequently directed attention to the importance of a continuous and plentiful supply of water. Irrespective of tho striking facts which have been elicited by investigations on the subject of Cholera, there is scarcely a disease to which tho human frame is liable which is independent of tho preventive, purifying, cleansing, and curative power of water. In consequence of tho representations of this and other District Boards we have now a daily supply. In many of the poorer districts however there arc no proper cisterns nor adequate accommodation for its preservation, even for tho day; and what is now required is a continuous, instead of an intermittent, supply. Whatever difficulty there may be in the way of the accomplishment of this object is of small moment compared with the preservation of life and health. It is to be feared that, in most cases, receptacles for water are seldom cleansed, and the impurities of months arc permitted to remain to adulterate every fresh supply. Your officers have endeavoured, as far as possible, to remedy these evils; and it will not be out of place, through the medium of this Report, to warn the inhabitants generally, and especially those whose position renders them less liable to the visits of the Inspector than tho poorer classes, of the' important and necessary duty of frequently cleansing their cisterns, and thus as far as possible preserving their water pure. Another evil to which I have adverted in former Reports is the overcrowding of the dwellings of the poor. While this continues Epidemic Disease will generate and spread; and it is certain that the increased mortality from Whooping Cough is chiefly due to this cause. The numerous improvements which continue to be made in and about the heart of London have so increased the value of house property that this result has been almost inevitable. Without in any measure desiring to question, either the wisdom or sincerity of 11 those who aro now agitating for a specific number of feet of ward room for the poor of our Workhouses—apparently irrespective of differences of position and ventilation—or offering any palliation for any evils which have been disclosed in respect to the management and accommodation of some of the Metropolitan Workhouses; still, it may bo doubted whether a correct knowledge of the far more deplorable state of the helpless and sick poor outsido would not lead to a diversion, in their favour, of some of this commendable zeal. In a vast number of instances, families, numbering from four to seven persons, ill or well, livo, cook, wash, and sleep in rooms the dimensions of which aro not greater than is now demanded for each sick person in the Workhouse. Legislation for house-room is confessedly more difficult than for Workhouse accommodation, and possibly this blot upon our civilization can only bo effectually diminished by considerablo personal effort and sacrifice on tho part of those who have been blessed with an abundance of pecuniary means. This object however will nover be accomplished until the profound ignorance of tho upper classes in respect to the dwellings and habits of the poor is dispelled; and sentimentalism and the love of popularity give place to an unobtrusive, conscientious, and self-sacrificing dischargo of duty. I havo already brought before you the principal points of interest disclosed by the statistical tables annexed to this Report. I now respectfully invito you to peruse them. So far as the past is concerned, they havo never been compiled with greater pleasure. They exhibit a diminished aggregate mortality, and a diminished mortality from Epidemic Disease; and also a favorable contrast with other districts. These are encouragements to work; and although tho futuro is somewhat clouded, in view of the importance of the facts and opinions I havo already advanced, and also with the prospect of coming disease, your officers have during tho past year endeavoured, to the best of their ability, to arrest its progress. I especially commend to your attention tho table of sanitary work, in tho accomplishment of which your Inspector has displayed his accustomed zeal. Nearly three thousand visits have been made, 558 houses inspected, tho same number of notices issued; 9 cesspools emptied and drained into tho sewer; 147 drains and privies cleansed and repaired; 247 dirty houses cleansed and whitewashed; and 27 drains trapped; besides numerous other important sanitary works, including tho inspection of 136 slaughter, cow, and bake-houses. It is again my pleasing duty to thank the Board and all its officers for their kind consideration towards me, and harmonious co-operation in all my attempts to discharge my duty. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 12 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH—Population at Census, 1861, 17,030.
