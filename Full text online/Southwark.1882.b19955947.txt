Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark, ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1883. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to Submit to you my Annual Report for the year ending March 26th, 1883. The your has been a healthy one, although the mortality has been only one lower than that of the Previous your; and I am happy to say that there has been no epidemic of either Small Pox or Scarlet Fever raging in our Parish. During the year 1102 males, and 1105 females were born and registered, giving a total of 2207. 1275 Deaths occurred, being one less than that of last year. 648 were Males, and 627 Females. The Deaths of Females exceeded that of Males by 21. 75 Deaths were recorded as having occurred in the Evelina Hospital, and 23 in Bethlem. The Births were 16 less than the previous year, and 932 in excess of Deaths. The Death rate for the your was a little over 21, and 6 be1ow the average for the last ten years. 11 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1882—3. TABLE No. 1.

Of these 185 were under five, and 70 at forty and over.

This is to be accounted for by the epidemic of Whooping Cough, which had been excessive in the last quarter of last year; but it is singular that the number of Deaths from this disease is exactly the same as that of the preceding year. 12 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. The proportion in which Measles and Whooping Cough occurred in different years as epidemics of childhood, deprives each of them very much of its importance as a test of the sanitary condition of the Parish.

There has been received from the Coroner £28 17s. 6d. for the use of the Court Room, and £33 has been paid to Mr. Burridge for the removal of Bodies upon the order of the Coroner. The Water Supply, on the whole, during the year has been good. The weather during the first three quarters was ungenial, and the temperature much below the average, attended by gales, especially one which occurred on the 28th of April, when the leaves on the south western side of all the trees were spoken of as blackened as if by fire; and the rain was much above the average. The fourth quarter was mild, and the mean temperature was 2.8 higher than the last forty-one years. The general work has been carried on steadily, and quietly, and nothing of serious importance came before us. 14 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. TABLE No. 8. 1882—3.

With regard to Vaccination we must hope that Parliament will not be induced to ??? the penalties for neglecting to comply with the provisions of the act, but rather ??? increase them, as it is only by vaccination and re-vaccination we can hope to stamp out the disease of Small Pox. 1882 and 1883.

Mr. Taylor's motion has been thrown out; but I should like to be allowed to quote ??? statistics given by Sir C. Dilke in the House of Commons on that occasion. He says, "It had been contended that the decline of small-pox had been due to ??? proved sanitary conditions. But this was disproved by a comparison between the period from 1847 to 1853, when vaccination was not compulsory, and the period since 1861, during which vaccination had been enforced. The reduction in cases of small-pox was from 100 to 51 among people of all ages; but it was only from 100 to 20 in the case of children under five years of age. The corresponding reduction in the case of all other diseases was from 100 to 93 in grown people to from 100 to 94 in children under five years old. These figures, he thought, proved that the great decline in small-pox had not been due to improved sanitary conditions. He believed it was a mistake to suppose that vaccination had been no protection to nurses in small-pox hospitals, but that many of them would have died if they had not been vaccinated. The case of the Post Office was very interesting. There were 10,504 persons employed in the Postal Service in London. All of them were required to be vaccinated on entering the service, unless the operation had been performed within seven years previously. In the ten years, 1870-80, there had not been a single case of death from small-pox; and although there had been an epidemic during the period mentioned, there had been only ten slight cases of small-pox amongst all the servants of the Post Office. In the Telegraph Department the numbers were not quite so good, for there had been twelve cases in a staff averaging 1500 men. Assuming that these figures were correct, and that 96 per cent of the population of the metropolis were vaccinated and 4 unvaccinated, they might draw an interesting inference from the figures of the last great epidemic. In the whole of the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board on that occasion, there had been 1358 deaths, of which not 4 but 40 per cent. were among persons altogether unvaccinated. In the period since the epidemic there had been 679 deaths, and in 453 cases the persons were unvaccinated, while in only 226 were they vaccinated. So that out of 3,360,000 persons vaccinated in London only 226 died, while out of 140,000 unvaccinated 453 died. As to the diseases alleged to have been caused by vaccination, it was distinctly shown there was a decrease in the mortality from erysipelas, and Mr. Hutchinson had clearly shown in regard to one particular disease that the risk of communication was so extremely small that it need not stand in the way of compulsory vaccination.

From the following Report, it will bo seen that the three Public Paying Closets have been used by 61,898 persons; and though there is no means of correctly ascertaining the numbers who have used the Free Closet, it is estimated that it has been used ??? upwards of 20,000 persons. That the establishment of these conveniences have been a great benefit to the public, experience has fully proved, whilst they are also a means of income to the Vestry.

SURVEYOR'S ANNUAL REPORT. For the Year ending 25th March, 1883. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Thirteenth Annual Report for your consideration, and to again respectfully draw your attention to the Paying of the Carriage-way, High Street. The Paving is so much worn that further repairing is worse than useless; and is now getting to that condition that presently it will not be available for the purpose of repairing Tabard Street, or any other side street. The South London Tramways Company having constructed Tramways through the Borough Road, Southwark Bridge Road, Lambeth Road, and St. George's Road. I should recommend the adoption of a similar course to that agreed to for the Waterloo Road, as to paving the sides, with cubes of a similar size to that used by the Tramway Company, which will eventually result in a great saving to the ratepayers, in respect of the maintenance and scavenging of the roads. The greater number of macadamized side streets have been made up with the old macadam excavated by the Tramways Company, and rolled with the steam roller, obviating the necessity of purchasing new granite for the purpose; and leaving the streets in good order for the next three years. The Contract with the Limmer Asphalte Paving Company having nearly expired, and the Asphalte Paving in the Old Kent Road and 25 Surveyor's Annual Report. High Street being also nearly worn out, it would, I think, be desirable to take into consideration the advisability of substituting some more durable material for these narrow and crowded footways. With reference to the lighting of the Parish, I am of opinion that a considerable saving could be effected by the adoption of the Average Meter System. I may mention St. Pancras as having succeeded in securing a very great reduction in the cost of lighting on this principle. THE FOLLOWING WORKS have been executed in THE ROADS DEPARTMENT. New York Paving laid in Footways 542 square yards Old Granite Cubes dressed and relaid in Carriageways and Crossings 3726 ,, ,, Old Granite Cubes relaid in Carriageways 1636 ,, „ New Broken Guernsey Granite laid in Roadways 334 cubic yards. Old Macadam excavated by Tramways Company and laid in Roadways 1733 ,, ,, Steam Roller for the above 52½ days. Openings in Public Ways by Gas and Water Companies 845 Asphalte laid in Public Footways 412 square yards. Licenses to erect Hoards 48 Courts and Alleys Repaved at the cost of the Owners 4 26 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. SCAVENGING, WATERING, AND REMOVAL OF DUST DEPARTMENT. A saving of £200 per annum has been effected in this Department by the adoption of my suggestion by the Vestry in obtaining the Water from the Company by Meter. The cost under the old system by mileage was £390 per annum. The cost by Meter was £190 3s. 11d. The quantity of Dust, Ashes, and Road Sweepings removed to Mr. Burton's Wharf for the year ending the 25th March last was as follows— DUST. Removed by Vestry's Vans 16,101 cubic yards. ,, „ Mr. Burton's Vans 1,065 ,, ,, 17,166 cubic yards. ROAD SWEEPINGS.
