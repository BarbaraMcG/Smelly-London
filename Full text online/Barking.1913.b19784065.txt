To the Chairman and. Members of the Urban District Council of Barking Town. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report upon the sanitary condition of your district during the year 1913. The year will always be remarkable as that in which the benefits of the National Insurance Act came into force, a measure which should have far-reaching effects upon the public health. Great activity has also been exhibited in the sanitary administration of the town, and much accomplished, with a prospect of more to follow. The question of planning the outlying districts, under the facilities of the Town Planning Act of 1909, has received consideration, and a special Committee formed to draw up a scheme or schemes. The Local Government Order of 1914 simplifies the rather complicated procedure under this Act, and material progress can be expected during the coming year. 6 The open spaces available to the public for recreation have been considerably increased; the Abbey field, 4 acres in extent, was opened early in the year, whilst the Council decided to include in the Park the 35 acres of the land at present used for agricultural purposes. This should help towards the amenities of town life. The prospective purchase of a piece of ground in the Eastbury Estate, will fulfil a need when the town develops in that direction, and will preserve a good example of sixteenth century architecture. The duty of housing the population has received practical attention, 52 houses having been erected in Boundary and Perth Roads, and 26 in Keith Road being in course of erection. The fact that out of over 6,000 houses within the district, only 52 are unoccupied, and these apparently are vacant not because a tenant at a rental cannot be found, but because they are for sale only, deserves serious consideration. I attribute the fall in the number of marriages from 295 to 222, or from 9.1 to 6.4 per 1,000 of population, to the fact that the parties concerned are unable to find suitable accommodation. The scheme for the continuation of St. Paul's Road, and for the rehousing of the people disturbed in Abbey Road and Heath Street, has been considerably advanced, and should be completed in the present year. The provision of a convenience for females has not yet materialized, and it is to be hoped that the objections to the site that naturally suggests itself will be removed. The paving of Ripple, portions of Longbridge Road, East Street, and Fanshawe Avenue with soft wood blocks, and the laying of tar slag macadam in Cambridge Road, Linton Road, and the upper end of Ripple Road should do much to lessen the amount of dust consequent upon fast vehicular traffic. The administrative block at your Isolation Hospital was completed during the year and occupied on the 23rd December. It 7 has done much for the comfort of the staff and satisfactory administration of the institution. The old dining room and kitchen have been converted into a discharge block for patients suffering from Scarlet Fever, and should to some extent prevent the occurrence of return cases. The location of the Hospital on its present site has been definitely decided upon, and a block plan of a hospital for 100 beds approved. A detailed plan of the first block has been prepared and submitted, but was deferred for a time. Although the present accommodation of 50 beds is adequate for the district, still the planning of the present wards is of such a nature as renders the individual isolation of patients suffering from mixed infection impossible. In several cases patients have contracted the disease for which they were isolated, and in others the course of the disease has been unnecessarily severe. Early in the year the lower part of the Hospital grounds was drained, raised, and planted with willows, the condition of the soil being much improved. Now that the whole area is available for the children to play over, it would be advisable for some adequate protection to be placed at the margin of the brook, as there is some chance of accident. An attempt was made to cultivate part of the vacant ground, but the results were such as did not warrant a repetition of the experiment. Staff. During the year Miss Atkinson resigned her position as Health Visitor and School Nurse, and Miss M. Holman was appointed to fill the vacancy. Also Miss Taylor, Matron of the Isolation Hospital, resigned her appointment through illness, and Miss Christie was appointed in her stead. The General Sanitary Conditions of the Town. Water Supply.—The town itself is supplied by the South Essex Water Company. During the year branch mains were laid from the Castle to the adjoining cottages, and complaints were 8 made of the tarry smell in the water, which was evidently due to the new pipes. This has since ceased. Samples taken of the Company's water gave satisfactory results on analysis. The rest of the district is supplied by wells. One sample taken from a well showed serious pollution, and was the probable cause of a case of Enteric Fever. Drainage and Sewage.—The sewers have been frequently flushed, cleansed, and many new connections have been made. Your Sewage Works have dealt satisfactorily with the drainage of the district, and have produced an effluent of average purity. Owing to the rapid increase of the town, the whole question of sewerage and sewage treatment is receiving detailed consideration. There is need for a sewer to the Creekmouth District, which should form an integral part of any re-arrangement of the drainage. An interesting experiment was conducted by a private firm in the distillation of sludge, certain oils and a carbonaceous residue being obtained. The results are said to have been satisfactory, and application has been made for more land to establish the process as a financial undertaking. Housing. (Sub-section 1 of Section 17 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909.) The house to house inspection has been continued, the numbers inspected being :— For the year 1910. Number inspected 385 1911 396 1912 1,132 1913 815 Half the tenements have received attention. Practically all that part of the town where supervision is necessary has now been systematically covered. In all other respects the inspections 9 and other work have been maintained up to the standard of previous years. The number of rooms added to the town in building's of various kinds is as follows:—1906, 969; 1907, 660; 1908, 432; 1909, 964; 1910, 630; 1911, 1,351; 1912, 419; 1913, 805, The additions are seen to be very variable, and approximate to an average of 500. The buildings erected and demolished during 1913 are as follows :— Number of houses demolished 4 Number of houses completed 163 Number of shops completed 5 Number of factories completed 4 Number of additions to buildings 31 The following figures as to rental in Barking and surrounding districts are of interest:— Tenements of 3 Rooms 4 Rooms 5 Rooms 6 Rooms Barking 4 6 5 10½ 8 1 11 6 East Ham 8 6½ 8 9½ 9 10½ 13 0 Ilford — 9 6 10 8½ — West Ham 6 9 8 3 10 6½ — Leyton 6 11½ 9 4 11 10½ 12 6 It is seen that the rentals in Barking are below those of other districts, and from the prices quoted 5-roomed houses at 7s. 6d., or a rental of is. 6d. per room, such as the Council have erected, should supply a much-felt need. From these facts it is not surprising that there should be great scarcity of houses, so much so that it is very desirable that the facilities conferred upon the Council by recent enactments should be utilized to meet this need. 10 The houses demolished consisted of the loop-holing of the row in Bifron Square, each remaining house being provided with separate yard and w.c. accommodation, the internal arrangements being also considerably modified. Collection of Dust, &c. The weekly collection of dust still continues, and seems to meet the requirements of the greater part of the town. It would be advisable, however, if a more frequent collection were made amongst the smaller houses in the summer months of the year. It is desirable that the present system of allowing the carriers to pick out any article of value from the dust should be discontinued, both on the account of the loss of time in the collection and the possible creation of a nuisance. Serious nuisance arose during the year in the Creekmouth District, and legal proceedings were taken against two firms, adjournments being granted in each case to carry out certain work which was thought to be necessary. The monthly rainfall for the last 5 years is given in the following table :— 1909. 1910. 1911. 1912. 1913. January .71 1.44 1.07 3.16 2.48 February .74 2.26 .99 1.46 .59 March 2.77 .87 1.37 2.09 1.76 April 1.56 1.45 1.40 .05 1.99 May 1.36 2.01 .80 .90 1.30 June 2.55 1.92 1.90 2.49 .33 July 2.94 2.37 .39 1.16 2.02 August 1.66 1.93 .62 3.88 1.94 September 1.90 .82 1.39 2.01 1.33 October 3.86 1.92 3.16 1.55 3.46 November .84 3.00 303 1.43 2.49 December 2.58 2.77 3.47 2.19 1.66 Total 23.47 22.76 19.59 22.37 21.35 11 The weather conditions of the past year were about average as judged by the previous 5 years. There were, however, short periods of hot weather during July and August, which account for a small outbreak of Epidemic Diarrhoea. Vital Statistics. Population. A little consideration of the population and its method of growth may be of use to the matters that are at present under consideration. The growth of the town since 1851 is as follows :— Census year. Population. Males. Females 1851 5,365 2,592 2,773 1861 5,591 2,702 2,886 1871 6,576 3,110 3,466 1881 9,203 4,462 4,741 1891 14,301 7,308 6,993 1901 21,547 11,012 10,535 1911 31,294 15,686 15,608 It is seen that the rapid increase began in 1871, shortly after the opening of the Southend and Tilbury line, and that its rate of increase has remained fairly constant since that time, averaging 50 per cent. every 10 years. The indication, however, is that this rate tends to get less, and that a population of under 45,000 is to be expected in 1921. An increasing population cannot continue for many years in face of a falling birth rate, and I should put the figure for the town in 1931 as between 50 and 60 thousand, rather nearer the latter than the former figure. It is interesting to note that from 1891 to 1911 males outnumber the females, 12 though in 1911 this superiority is almost lost. This fact depends on industries which offer employment for males. The following events in connection with these figures should be borne in mind, if the movements are to be correctly interpreted Easter, 1854.—Forest Gate and Tilbury connected by rail through Barking to Liverpool Street. 1857.—Southend, Barking, East Ham line opened (London, Tilbury and Southend Railway). 1862.—Removal of fishing industry to East Coast ports. 1866.—Jute works established. 1871.—Beckton Gas Works opened. These were considerably extended in later years. 1888.—Separation of the Ilford District for civic purposes. It is a point of some moment that in spite of the industrial fluctuations the district has steadily increased in population, and hence it must be assumed that the inhabitants have been mainly dependent for their livelihood upon work outside the town. If we consider the nature of our population as regards its age distribution, we find the following, after the crude figures have been reduced to a basis of 1,000 (Census 1911):— England and Wales. Barking. Males. Females. Males. Females. Age period. per 1,000. per 1,000. per 1,000. per 1,000. 0—5 years 111 103 138 134 5—10 106 99 128 129 10—15 100 94 119 120 15—20 95 90 96 96 20—25 86 90 74 79 25—35 162 168 152 151 13  England and Wales. Barking. Males. Females. Males. Females. Age period. per 1,000. per 1,000. per 1,000. per 1,000. 35—45 134 135 130 126 45—55 97 98 86 82 55—65 62 65 46 42 65—75 35 41 21 26 75—85 11 15 6 8 85 and upwards 1 2 1 1 When this series is compared with that for England and Wales, it is seen that there is a marked excess in Barking at all ages under 15, that is School Children and Infants, and a deficit of those who should be wage-earning units. It is easily understood that this factor means that the town is undertaking the Education of an immigrant population which contains an excess of young people. It is further observed, however, that whilst both have an excess of males at the earlier years, Barking alone maintains this position from the 25 to the 65 years inclusive, a fact which is frequently observed in industrial districts. Considering the age and sex distribution in each census since 1851, the following figures are obtained when reduced to a basis of 1,000 of each age and sex. 14 1911 1901 1891 1881 1871 1851 and 1861 Males Females M ales Females Males Females Males Females Males Females Males Females 0 to 5 138 134 146 157 165 175 162 148 142 151 158 145 5 to 10 128 129 140 147 147 145 128 132 145 123 140 127 10 to 15 119 120 141 140 115 116 119 119 120 113 101 115 15 to 20 96 96 98 84 89 87 105 104 92 94 96 81 20 to 25 74 79 82 80 85 81 89 97 77 90 81 88 25 to 35 153 151 147 147 168 155 137 131 157 146 134 146 35 to 45 130 126 121 116 107 101 116 114 114 112 110 114 45 to 55 86 82 70 63 72 70 74 78 75 72 80 84 55 to 65 46 43 37 41 34 42 44 45 42 52 56 57 65 to 75 21 26 15 19 14 21 19 23 28 31 33 31 75 to 85 6 8 4 5 4 6 7 9 8 14 12 11 85 to end 1 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 1 2 1 2 The outstanding feature of this series is the shrinkage, especially since 1891, of the distribution, that is we have relatively less infants and people of extreme old age than in former years. The latter is purely a relative phenomenon, but the former is very real, and constitutes one of the most serious aspects of our social life. What the effect of the loss will be is hard to 15 say, and much diversity of opinion has been expressed upon it, though I think eventually that our intuitive wisdom, which looks upon a falling birth rate as dangerous, will be ultimately proved to be correct. In last year's report the history of the district was given from the period 1891 to 1912, but it was pointed out at the time that the populations on which the rates were based were obviously wrong. In the present series these errors have been removed, and the rates re-calculated, and it will be seen that the sequences show some material alteration. The birth rate for women between 15 to 45 has been added. Year Population calculated to mid-year Birth Rate per 1,000 population Birth Kate per 1,000 women, 15 10 45 years Infantile Mortality. Deaths within one year per 1,000 births Deaths per 1,000 of Population 1891 14477 442 213 150 19.5 1892 15900 41.0 209 151.8 17.7 1893 16622 37.8 193 156.6 17.3 1894 17352 39.9 205 122.4 11.9 1895 18090 38.3 196 162.6 172 1896 18835 37.1 191 148.9 13 3 1897 19588 39.4 204 178 18 4 1898 20349 35.6 185 178 15.8 1899 21118 37.8 197 172 18.4 1900 21730 36.0 187 203 17.7 1901 21954 40.9 193 172 158 1902 22855 35.7 168 134 14.7 1903 23766 36.0 168 ... 15.0 1904 24686 36.3 169 143 15.6 1905 25615 35.1 163 142 15.5 1906 26555 32.9 152 162 13.6 1907 27504 31.6 145 112 11.6 1008 28463 32.5 149 117 13.2 1909 29432 29.4 134 107 11.5 1910 30410 29.6 135 97.7 10.7 1911 31513 31.9 142 157 16.1 1912 32521 29.6 130 95.1 10.0 1913 33551 30.4 129 113.3 14.1 16 Marriages. There were 222 marriages, as compared with 295 the previous year. The decrease is surprising in view of the comparative prosperity and undisturbed trade conditions. It is highly probable, as has been already stated, that a scarcity of house accommodation may account for some at least of the discrepancy. The rates for 1911, 1912 and 1913 per 1,000 population are 15, 9, 6.4, that is to say the number married in 1913 is only half that of 1911 in proportion to the number of marriageable people. Of the 222, 188 were solemnized in the Church of England. Births. There were 1,009 births registered in the district, and 14 were returned as of mothers ordinarily resident in the district and registered elsewhere, the total number being 1,023. Of these 26 were illegitimate (the number of males and females being equal). The percentage equals 2.5 of the total number of births, the figure for the previous year being 3.12. This in view of the decrease of the marriage rate indicates an improvement in the moral tone of the town. The relative number of the sexes was 505 males and 518 females, the reverse of what is usually the case, and the rate per 1,000 of the population works out to 30.4. The relation of this figure with previous years is given in the table, page 15. If the rate per 1,000 women 15 to 45 years of age is considered, it is seen to be the lowest on record. When distributed in the various wards the figures are as follows :— North. South. East. West. Not stated. Number of births 149 234 341 285 14 Population 4.634 7,331 13,533 8,705 — Rateper 1,000 29.8 31.9 25.2 32.7 — 17 That it is hardly correct to compare these rates without some correction is shown by the proportion of children under 14, as revealed by the school census, thus :— North. South. East. West. Total population for year ending 1913 4.634 7.331 13.533 8,705 34403 Number of children 14 years and under 1,235 2,647 4,142 2,814 10,838 Number of children per 1,000 267 361 306 323 The age distribution of the East and North Wards are seen to be very different, a fact which must be remembered when we desire to draw conclusions from the rates for birth, death, or any particular disease. The rates for the districts are materially the same as that for the previous year. Deaths. It is obvious that if 10 people die out of 1,000 each year as in 1912, that the average duration of life must be 100 years; further, as the age at death varies, some dying within one year, others should live to 200 or more. The deduction is obviously absurd, and the reason will be seen to lie in the age distribution, which is not that of a normal population, for it contains a large excess of units of favourable ages (adults) who have immigrated from other districts, or have accumulated owing to the great reduction in the death-rate consequent on sanitary and other improvements since the passing of the 1875 Act. I have been unable to calculate the age death-rates for previous years, owing to the rather clumsy way in which they have been classified, hence it cannot be definitely stated to what extent the undoubted fall is due—to alteration in age and sex distribution or a real improvement in the life expectancy of the district. I am of the opinion 18 that both have been operative factors. It is with regret that I cannot assign the whole to the very praiseworthy efforts that have been made to improve the amenities of our town life. If we cannot compare, without correction, one year with another in the same district, then it would be childish to compare one district with another, until the nature of their populations have been examined. I am afraid that this simple precaution is frequently overlooked, and many wrong conclusions drawn by the uninitiated. To get an idea of the significance of our deathrate, I have compared it with England and Wales in two ways. ist.—The death-rate of the country generally for the year 1911 has been calculated on the supposition that its age and sex distribution was the same as Barking in the corresponding year. These distributions have already been given (page 15 ), and that for England and Wales is :— Persons. Males. Females. Death rates (England and Wales) standardized to 1901 14.3 15.3 13.3 0—5 43.7 47.3 40.1 5—10 3.4 3.5 3.4 10—15 2.1 2.0 2.1 15—20 2.9 3.0 2.7 20—25 3.5 3.9 3.2 25—35 4.5 5.0 4.1 35—45 7.3 8.1 6.6 45—55 13.0 14.7 11.4 55—65 26.1 29.6 23.0 65—75 56.4 63.4 50.9 75—85 124.2 135.7 116.4 85 and upwards 246.2 270.7 232.7 Deaths of infants under 1 year per 1,000 births 130.0 142.0 117.0 19 Taking the year 1911 as above as our standard year, we find that had the age and sex distribution of England and Wales been the same as Barking the death-rate for the country generally would have been 14.28 per 1,000. The actual death-rate was 14.6 Hence the district is favourably situated. The converse of this process is rather more difficult, and cannot be done in any details for the reason already given. for the reason already given. Taking the deaths for the ten years 1901-1911, and calculating the rates for each age period, both sexes being taken together we have :— Age. Barking. Deaths per 1,000. England and Wales. Deaths per 1,000. 0—5 43.3 43.7 5—5 2.7 2.8 15—25 3.6 3.2 25—65 8.9 10.2 65 and over 70.8 72.5 Thus the mean death-rate for the 10 years 1901-1911 was 13.74 per 1,000, and we find that had the age and sex distribution been the same as that of England and Wales, the death-rate would have risen to 13.92 per 1,000, which corroborates the previous calculation. Further, it is seen that for all ages, except the 15-25 period, the district has the advantage of the country generally. From the above data, by using Dr. Brownlee's constants, the real death-rate and life expectancy for the town can be calculated ; taking the formula D2 = .6842 D1 + 9.65 were D2 = real death rate and D1 = corrected death rate we find that the number dying per 1,000, on the basis of a normal age and sex distribution, is 19.17, which means that each person born i,n Barking has an expectancy of life of 52 years. The English life-table for 1891-1901 gives 44 years. 20 We thus see that the real death-rate (19.17) is greater than the corrected death-rate (13.92), which means that the district is creating life faster than it is using it, a condition deserving of some congratulation when it is borne in mind that most of our large towns have already turned the zenith, and are using up their life capital faster than they are creating it. If out birthas rate continues to fall at the same rate as it has done in the last 80 years town-planning schemes and other provision for future expansion will soon become unnecessary, as the population will cease to increase, a condition of affairs which I estimate will occur in about 30 or 40 years. Turning now to the past year, there were 376 deaths registered in the district, and 98 as occurring in other areas, but of people ordinarily resident in Barking, giving a total of 474, and a rate of 13.66 per 1,000 living, a figure which approximates closely to the average of the previous ten years. Of the total number of deaths 252 were males, 222 females. The distribution in the various wards were as follows :— North. South. East. West. Number 65 89 144 171 Rate per 1,000 14.2 12.14 10.6 19.64 These series show much the same points as were indicated last year. The reliability of the rates will, however, get less and less until the next census is taken, owing to the error in estimating the increase of population in the various wards. The number of uncertified deaths was 28, and on 12 of these postmortem examinations were held, the causes being returned as :— Injury, 1 ; drowning, 3; suffocation, 1 ; suicide, 3; and natural causes, 18. Age at Death. (1) Under One Year (Infantile Mortality). There were 116 deaths registered of infants under one year, the rate per 1,000 births being 113. In the ten years 1891-1901 21 the average rate was 163, and in the period 1901-1911 153.2, giving a fall of 10 per 1,000, an improvement which, in all probability, is directly due to the marked diminution in the number of infants born to each mother. A smaller family naturally means that the home circumstances are improved, and the health and strength of the mother are more able to meet the demands made upon them. Compared with the previous experienoe- of the district, the past year can be looked upon as a very favourable one. Out of the 116, 21 lived 7 days or less, and 50, or nearly half, died before the end of the first four weeks. These are deaths which cannot be attributed to the environment influencing the child as an independent unit, but must be attributed to some casual agent in the mother herself. Although only four deaths were attributed to syphilis, the consequences of immorality in its various forms must account for a much larger number. The distribution in the various wards was as follows :— North. South. East. West. Total. No. of deaths 13 30 36 37 90 Births 149 234 341 285 Rate per 1,000 births registered 87.2 128.2 105.5 130.1 The rates correspond fairly well with the averages for the previous five years, and what was said on that occasion is equally applicable now. The chief causes of death were:—Atrophy and Wasting, 24; Premature Births, 23; Congenital Malformation, 4; Bronchitis, 4, Pneumonia, 10; Whooping Cough, 1. (2) Other Age Periods). The age distribution of the deaths show some peculiarities. Thus there is a marked increase in those dying from 1 to 5 years : 86, as against 27 for the previous year, the main causes being:— 22 Measles (24, against 1); Tuberculosis (17, against 3); and Pneumonia (17, against 3). These last bad conditions are to some extent consequent on the epidemic of Measles early in the year. It is probable that the extremely low infantile mortality of the previous year was dependent on the mild and equitable season, and a number of feeble lives were terminated in the spring of 1914, which under more normal conditions would have died in the previous year. The remaining periods call for no comment. Cause of Death. (a) Deaths from the Zymotic Diseases. These include :— Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Typhus Fever, Enteric Fever, Infective Enteritis (Infantile Diarrhoea). There were 69 deaths, as compared with 24 for the previous year, returned as due to the above causes, which oroduce a rate of 1.98 per 1,000, as against 0.7. The increase is dependent on 30, against 1, with respect to Measles, and 31 as against 5 in the case of Diarrhoea. Whooping Cough also claimed 15, as against 1 in the previous year. The association between Measles and Whooping Cough is a common occurrence. (b) Cancer or Malignant Disease is responsible for 20 deaths, a figure corresponding closely to those of the previous years. (d) Tuberculosis.—There were 69 deaths certified as due to some form of Tuberculosis, as against 28, 40, 30, and 36 in the previous four years, the rates being 1.9, 0.81, 1.15, 0.86, and 1.03 respectively. As this extraordinary rise in the death-rate from this disease requires sorre consideration, a little space may ,with advantage be given to it. The details are as follows :— 1913. 1912. Phthisis 50 28 Tub. meningitis 13 1 Other tubercular diseases 6 6 23 The distribution according to age is peculiar. The Increase in Tubercular Meningitis is confined to five years and under, and is probably dependent on the epidemic of Measles. The increase with respect to Phthisis is confined to those dying after the 25th year. That Phthisis has suddenly become rampant in our town can be dismissed, but there can be no doubt that the attitude of the profession has completely changed towards this disease. Previous to 1912, as far as possible the certification of Phthisis was avoided on account of family prejudice and certain financial disabilities that might follow. Now, however, if a person is attacked by this disease he has everything to gain by its disclosure, and hence should death follow, the cause can hardly be concealed. This fact is somewhat disquieting, as it tends to cause some doubt as to the reliability of deductions based on facts collected from the certificates furnished by the General Practitioner, and lends a powerful argument to those who advocate that these forms should be confidential between the Doctor and the Authorities, a change which I must hold to be wrong in principle, though useful in practice. The distribution of the deaths per 1,000 population is as follows :— North, 2.37. South, 1.22. East, 1.62. West, 2.87. Adding these deaths to those that occurred in the previous five years, and taking the distribution of the population to be the same as for the year 1911 (middle vear), we get the following rates :—1.24, 0.88, 1.13 and West 1.4 respectively. (c) Pneumonia and Bronchitis.—There were 77 deaths from these causes, as against 62 for the previous year. In so far as this increase affected mainly those between 1 and 5 years, they can be looked upon as being associated with the epidemic of Measles and Whooping Cough, in such cases where the primary cause escaped recognition. 24 The remaining causes show no variation which calls for remark. Prevention of Infectious Disease. Some chanere has occurred in the scope of this aspect of work of the department, particularly with respect to Tuberculosis, which is now notifiable in all its forms. The County Authorities have also decided to extend the services of their scheme to noninsured persons, so that treatment is afforded to all who should be so unfortunate as to be afflicted with this disease. To prevent overlapping, it has been decided to appoint the Tuberculosis Officer allocated to this district Assistant Medical Officer of Health for Tuberculosis. Speaking generally, those outside circumstances, such as housing, sanitation, disinfection, etc., will still remain in the province of the department, but the actual concerns of the patient himself and his treatment appertain to the Assistant for Tuberculosa. A word of warning with respect to the whole scheme might with advantage be given as to the results. As has been indicated already, the death-rates are of such a nature that in process of time they are bound to rise, although the actual duration of life may remain unaltered. The same caution must be observed in drawing conclusions from the Phthisis death-rate when we desire to decide in our own minds as to whether this enormous experimental scheme is having the desired effect. There were 477 notificat:ons received during the year, compared with 301 in the previous year. The details being Scarlct Fever 136 (3.92 per 1,000), Diphtheria 36 (1.04 per 1,000), Enteric Fever 4, Puerperal Fever 4, Erysipelas 31, Tuberculosis 244, (7.03 per 1,000), Ophthalmia 11, Poliomyelitis 9. The distribution of these diseases during the year was as follows:— 25  1st qtr. 2nd qtr. 3rd qtr. 4th qtr. Scarlet fever 54 16 25 4i Diphtheria and memb. croup 9 12 7 8 Phthisis 79 54 49 57 Enteric — — 2 2 Erysipelas 14 8 3 6 Ophthalmia 5 3 — 3 Poliomyelitis and meningitis — — 5 6 Puerperal fever — 1 2 1 Comparing these figures with the previous year, there was an increase of 41 cases, with respect to Scarlet Fever, corresponding to an augmented rate of 1 per 1,000. There is little change in numbers of the other diseases notified. The comparative figures are per 1,000 inhabitants :— Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. England 3.51 1.39 0.22 County of Essex 2.50 1.41 0.17 Barking 4.17 1.10 0.15 County of London 3.89 1.70 0.17 From which it is seen that although the rates for the district are a little higher than in the County of Essex, it is approximately the same as the County of London. Tuberculosis. The 244 notifications of Tuberculosis were distributed as follows:—179 being returned as Phthisis and 65 other forms. In the former case the rate was 5.16 and the latter 1.87 per 1,000. 26 It is of interest to note that with an attack-rate for Phthisis of 5.16 and a death-rate of 1.9, the average period of time from the recognition of the disease to the death of the patient should be 2.71 years. That this disease will disappear is not to be expected, and all that can be hoped from the present crusade is that this average period of 2.71 years will be lengthened. The following details have been collected from the notifications sent in under the " Tuberculosis Regulations for 1913 — Under Form A (Primary Notification).—Phthisis, 101 ; other Tubercular Diseases, 59. Under Form B (School Cases).—Phthisis, 4; others, 4. Under Form C (Admitted to Institutions).—Phthisis, 24; others, x. Under Form D (Discharged from Institutions).—Phthisis, 32 ; others, 2. The distribution of the disease in the district was as follows :— North South. East. West. Phthisis 21 29 37 35 Other Tubercular Diseases 8 15 18 22 Deaths 11 9 22 25 Death rate per 100 attacked 37.9 20.5 40 43.8 The highest is seen to be in the West Ward. The attack rates were 6.2, 6.0, 4.0, and 6.5. 27 I'he age distribution was :— Under 1 0 to 5 5 to 15 15 to 25 25 to 35 35 to 65 over 65 Phthisis 3 12 20 20 46 15 6 Other Tubercular Diseases 4 17 29 7 4 1 1 Deaths Rate per 1,000 If duplicates are excluded, out of 188, 118 were males and 70 females. The institutions to which cases were sent were as follows : Sanatoria, 8; Poor Law Institutions, 9; Municipal Hospitals, 10; and General Hospitals, 1. The kind of house occupied by those attacked was :— 2 Rooms 1 3 „ 2 4 ,, 52 5 ,, 17 6 and over 15 Deaths for 1912-13 :— 4 Rooms 18 5 ,, 5 6 and over 4 From this it would appear as if the disease, once having declared itself, was not very materially modified by the kind of house occupied, which is rather an unexpected result. The occupations were as follows :— 28 Notified Deaths Notifiol Deaths Hawker 1 0 Clerk 4 1 Barman 1 0 Colour mixer 1 0 Charwoman 1 0 Coffee stall holder 1 0 Labourer 13 5 1nsurance agent 1 0 Gas labourer 5 2 Army 1 1 School children 20 2 Cobbler 1 0 Housewife 12 4 Cleaner 1 0 Sack repairer 1 0 Coalie 1 0 Service 3 0 Waiter 1 0 Waitress 1 0 Policeman 1 0 Factory hand 5 1 Sailor 1 0 Compositor 1 0 As I have no information as to the number of individuals following- the above occupations, it is impossible to say which favour Phthisis and which do not. The details of the work of the Assistant Medical Officer for Tuberculosis for the year ending February igth, 1914, are as follows :— For Year ending February 19, 1914. In all 39 persons have been referred to the Tuberculosis Dispensary for advice and diagnosis ; of these 28 were insured (males 25, females 3), 11 were uninsured (males 4, females 7). The areas affected were :— Males: 21 Phthisis, 5 Phthisis and Tubercular Glands, 1 Tuberculosis of Knee, 1 Tuberculosis of Knee and Hip, 1 Tuberculosis of Lungs and Larynx. Females : 5 Tuberculosis of Lungs, 3 Tuberculosis of Lungs and Glands, 2 no disease. 29 Under 21 years of age: 5 males and 4 females; over 21 years of age 24 males and 4 females. The nature of the treatment given was as follows:—15 attended the dispensary, with the result that 4 were discharged fit for work, 3 were sent to sanatoria, and 8 are still attending (1 receiving tuberculin still attending). 11 received domiciliary treatment, of whom 1 has improved, 2 became worse and were sent to sanatoria, 4 are still receiving domiciliary and extra nourishment, 4 have died; the remaining 17 patients received hospital treatment, the results being: 3 discharged improved, 1 died, 13 still in hospital. Thus out of the 37, 7 were discharged as improved, 5 have died, and the remaining 25 are still under treatment. It is a point of some regret that only 39 out of the 244 notified as suffering from the disease, or 16 per cent., availed themselves of the facilities offered. It is to be hoped, however, that the more frequent attendance at the newly-established centre may have a beneficial effect upon the scope of this aspect of preventive medicine. Vaccination. It is with regret that I have to report that the number of infants successfully vaccinated becomes smaller each year. That Smallpox will eventually become prevalent can be taken as assured, but as to whether it will ever reach to the extent of a serious epidemic is doubtful, as the effect of 30 or 40 cases in our own district would be a general rush to the local practitioners to get vaccinated. It must be always borne in mind that the objection to this slight operation is not on the ground that the parents cfco not believe in the efficacy of the remedy, but that they do not care to see their infants subjected to a slight risk, for what is to them a problematical benefit. 30 1912. 1913. The figures for the last two years are :— Successfully vaccinated 420 360 Conscientious objections 343 394 Died unvaccinated 71 75 Postponed 6 8 Removed to places unknown 53 40 To be dealt with (not 6 months months old) 8 136 Births registered 901 1,013 The percentages successfully vaccinated for the last five years are: 35.5, 46.6, 54.6, 59.6, 66.3. Hospital. The changes that have occurred in the buildings, etc., have already been briefly touched upon. The number of cases remaining at the end of 1912 was 26, and 153 were admitted during the year; 114 were suffering from Scarlet Fever; 32 from Diphtheria; 4 from Enteric Fever; and 3 from Phthisis. The previous year the total number of admissions was 125, or 28 less. The discrepancy was mainly due to an increase of 25 cases of Scarlet Fever during the current year. There were 6 deaths in the Institution, 1 from Scarlet Fever, 3 from Diphtheria, 1 from Membranous Croup, and 1 from Enteric Fever. The average duration of stay in Hospital for each disease was as follows :— 1913. 1912. 1911. Scarlet fever 37.1 39.5 52.44 days Diphtheria 22.7 32.1 40.8 ,, Enteric fever 19.5 41.2 40.0 ,, 31 It will be noticed that whilst Scarlet Fever remains at a little over five weeks, Diphtheria and Enteric Fever are much reduced. The reason is given in the following paragraph :— Errors of Diagnosis. Out of the 114 cases of Scarlet Fever admitted, 36 were severe, 64 mild, and in 14 cases, or 12 per cent., the diagnosis was incorrect; five of these developed the disease shortly after admission; one Chicken Pox, three Measles, and one Diphtheria. Six cases were admitted within 14 days from the same house to which a convalescent had been sent, being 4.28 per cent, of the discharges. The usual percentage is about 5 of all discharges. In the case of Diphtheria the error of diagnosis is much larger. Out of 32 cases the disease was severe in 14, and on three occasions tracheotomy was required; of the other 18 the condition was mild in 9, and the remainder suffered from other diseases being 28 per cent, of the admissions. Of the four cases of Enteric Fever, in one only was the diagnosis correct. The corresponding figures given in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's report are for Scarlet Fever 12 per cent, error, Diphtheria 16 per cent, error, and Enteric Fever 50 per cent, error. In so far as the Practitioner sees the case first and has observed it in its initial stages, and this applies especially to the case of Scarlet Fever, it would be highly unwise for your Medical Officer to refuse to admit doubtful cases. On the other hand, it is obviously unfair to place such patients in a general ward. The only practical solution of the difficulty is to isolate all such children. More than this, to obviate the risk of introducing Measles or other diseases to children already debilitated from an attack of Scarlet Fever, it would be most desirable to isolate all admissions for seven days before allowing them to mix in the general ward. In the detailed plans that were submitted, the above points were borne in mind and provided for. 32 Cost of Hospital. The following figures differ from those in previous reports, in so far as the expenses are taken from January ist to December 31st, and not from April 1st to March 31st, so as to correspond with the period on which this report is based. Thus the actual cost from January ist, 1913, to December 31st, 1913, was £1,622 12s. iod., being £40 less than the cost of the previous year. The above figure includes some larg' items for furnishing and the installation of gas to the various units of the Hospital. The cost of food only was £383 6s. 4d., approximately £100 less than the previous year, in spite of the fact that the number of patients admitted was somewhat greater (153, against 125). The cost of food per day for patients and staff inclusive was 9½d., as against 11d. per day for the previous year. It must be remembered that these figures are not strictly comparable. The nature of the illness, treated at the expense of the Health Committee, at the School Clinic, and being other than school children, were as follows :— Disease of Under School Age. Over School Age. Digestive System 51 3 Nervous System 5 8 Circulatory System 8 2 Vermin, etc — 3 Cysts — 3 Diseases of the Ear 3 2 Diseases of the Eye 26 19 Diseases of Nose and Throat 7 3 Diseases of Chest 8 2 33 Disease of Under School Age. Over School Age. Infectious Diseases 10 1 Tubercular Diseases 8 1 General Diseases 18 2 Diseases of the Breast — 13 Sores and Abscesses 27 30 Ill-defined and nothing wrong 64 16 235 108 The number of cases treated shows a considerable reduction, the chief causes being the operation of the Insurance Act and the change in the staffing of the Institution. Care of Infant Life. There were 934 births notified during the year, and 1,009 registered, leaving 75 who had failed to comply with the statutory requirements. The percentage of defaulters for the last three years was 11.9, 5.8, and 7.4, numbers which can with justification be attributable to forgetfulness. As many as 96 per cent, of the number of births registered received a visit from the Health Visitor. Out of 934 cases, 412 were attended by a General Practitioner and 522 by midwives; close on half of the latter received their assistance from the local branch of the Plaistow Maternity Charity. The following table gives the figures for the last three years:— 1911. 1912. 1913. Total number registered 1,005 964 1,009 Total number notified 885 908 934 Neglects to notify 120 56 75 Attended by doctors — 382 412 Attended by midwives — 556 522 Number visited 779 936 971 34 In 266 cases re-visits were necessary; 43 of these required a third, 10 a fourth, seven a fifth, and three a sixth. The reasons why further supervision was required were : 133 first children, four twins, 51 poverty, 16 uncleanliness, 22 artificial feeding, and 40 other causes. At the time of the first visit out of 744, 695 were entirely breast fed, 25 mixed, and 24 entirely artificially. Out of the 266 re-visited, at about the third month 242 were still entirely on the breast, 12 mixed, and 30 artificially. Thus within a short period of birth 93.4 per cent, are fed entirely at the breast, and 90.9 after three months. This point is also exemplified by the statements made as to the length of time the previous child to the one under enquiry was suckled. Age at which Last Child was Weaned; per 100. 1911. 1912. At one month 7.28 % 7.22 % 5.35 % At two months 1.82 % 2.97 % 3.89 % At three ,, 2.05 % 3.61 % 4.38 % At four ,, 0.91 % 1.91 % 1.78 % At five ,, 0.91 % 2.55% 1.78 % At six ,, 2.73 % 2.76 % 1.62 % At seven ,, 1.59 % 2.34 % 1.30 % At eight 0.68 % 3.61 % 1.78% At nine ,, 13.44 % 15.28 % 15.23 % Ten months and over 68.56 % 57.74 % 62.88 % Total Number of Enquiries 439. 471. 617. It is seen that over 70 per cent, of our infants received the supply that is their right for an adequate period of time, and there is no evidence of any desire on the part of the mothers to shirk their duty. 35 In those cases artificially fed, the nature of the bottle found in use was as follows :— 1911. 1912. 1913 Boat-shaped 28 36 32 Other styles 6 3 5 In only 18 cases was the mother employed, as compared with 16 and 23 in the previous two years. The following figures give some idea as to the reason of death other than its immediate cause. The last column gives the percentage dying in first year, based on the experience of the years 1912-1913 :— Total Numbers 1913 Numbers dying in first year 1913 Percentage 1912 and 1913 Attended by Doctors 412 36 10.2 Attended by Midwives 522 57 8.5 Mother Defective or 111 35 19 65.9 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 11 1 14.8 Breast Fed 695 59 6.9 Artificial Feeding 24 10 17.7 Mixed 25 2 7.9 Mother Employed 18 3 9.1 Cradle Used 149 16 6.37 Dirty Houses 16 4 15.6 Illegitimates 9 2 22.2 From the above percentages, assuming that the numbers were large enough to be beyond the errors of random sampling, we would deduce the following factors as being prejudicial to the infant, placing them in order of merit:—Illness on part of the mother comes top, then illegitimacy, artificial feeding, dirty 36 houses, ophthalmia, medical attention, employment of mothers. The rather high rate of death amongst those attended by medical men is due of course to the fact that all the difficult labours are attended by them. The effect of a " dirty house " is very instructive. Baby-Feeding Depot. Under the auspices of the " Infant Care Association " a feeding depot has been established, and a food has been supplied suitable for infants at one penny per pint. Towards the end of the year the same food in a dried form was introduced, as many mothers found it difficult to attend daily. The number who have received the " prepared milk " from May to December inclusive was 60, of whom 8 have died, which equals 13.3 per cent. All the infants were delicate at the time they were received by the Depot. The average length of time during which the milk was supplied was 5.70 weeks. The number who received the milk for less than one week was 6. The number on the specially prepared dried milk on December 13th was 15. (The number at the time of writing is 30.) All these children appear to be thriving satisfactorily. The following is a statement of the financial position of the depot:— Dr. £ s. d. Cr. £ s. d. Donations IO 15 6 Purchase of 20 10 9½ Milk Sale to December 31st 21 11 10 terials for Milk Donation to Entertainment 0 13 2 Apparatus, etc. 6 2 8¼ Balance in Bank 5 O 8¼ £32 7 4 £32 7 4 37 Taking- the value of goods in hand and apparatus at £5 os. 8¼d. it leaves a net balance of 6s. nd. in favour of the Depot for the year. The actual cost to the mothers works out to one penny per day for a child under twelve months old. Baby's Welcome. The " Infant Care Association " has also undertaken to supply a cup of tea to all those attending these afternoon meetings, the occasion being made more of a social nature than formerly, the Education Committee having allowed their rooms at the School Clinic to be used for this purpose since July. The number enrolled on the books for the year was 160, and the average attendance being eighteen, a slight improvement on the previous year. It is to be regretted that 30 of the mothers only attended Once, as it is desirable that a continuous record of the infant's progress should be obtained, so that the best can be done for it. Ambulance. The Ambulance provided by public subscription and horsed by the Council made 88 journeys during the past year, as against 81 in the previous year, 25 of these being accidents and 63 private cases. The institutions to which the patients were removed were mainly the London and Popular Hospitals, the numbers being 29 and 27 cases respectively. Food and Drugs. The following are the figures with reference to the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts :— 38 Number of samples taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for the year ended December 31st, 1913 :— Milk 79 Butter 55 Other Samples 5 Total 139 Of this number 9 samples of milk were reported against and one sample of butter. Eight prosecutions for milk adulteration were taken, and one for butter. Two cases resulted in dismissal, one milk and one butter, and the following fines inflicted in the other cases :— 2 Fines of 10s. and 9s. costs each. 3 Fines of £1 and 9s. costs each. 1 Fine of £3 and 9s. costs. 1 Fine of £5 and 9s. costs. One letter of caution was sent. I am, Your obedient servant, R. J. Ewart. 39 TABLE I VITAL STATISTICS OF WHOLE DISTRICT DURING 1913 AND PREVIOUS YEARS Year.
