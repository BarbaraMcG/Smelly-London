CAM 33 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF CAMBERWELL ANNUAL (ABRIDGED) REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH H. W. BARNES, M.B., B.Ch., D.P.H., for the year 1944. CAM 33 Public Health Department. Town Hall, Camberwell, S.E.5. 27th September, 1945. To His Worship the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, This report like the reports on the health of the Borough and the work of the Public Health Department for the years 1939-43 is an abridged war-time report. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough throughout the year gave no cause for anxiety. An outbreak of influenza which started at the end of 1943 continued in the early part of the year. Local arrangements were made at the suggestion of the Ministry of Health to overcome the difficulties arising out of the shortage under War conditions of medical and nursing assistance, help in the home and the provision of meals in affected households. The local doctors were fortunately able to meet all demands for their services and the local branch of the Womens Voluntary Services dealt with the few requests received for domestic help and the provision ox meals in the homos of the afflicted. The number of deaths was 18. It is now possible to publish the population figures which had been previously withheld during the war years for security reasons. Those figures relate solely to the civilian population of the Borough. The birth and death rates are reprinted for the years 1939-43 together with the corresponding rates for 1944. 1939. 1940. 1941. 1942. 1943. 1944. Population. 219,500 173,750 127,570 129,900 132,330 129,880 Birth rate. 13.85 15.90 15.60 18.14 18.76 18.93 Death rate. 12.43 19.13 19.90 15.64 16.00 18.70 Infantile Mortality rate. 36.00 46.6 58.82 53.88 48.32 52.05 Maternal Mortality rate. 2.04 1.77 6.52 2.47 1.18 1.58 Tuberculosis Mortality rate. 0.79 0.86 1.03 1.00 1.04 0.84 The number of cases of infectious disease in 1944 remained at a low level. The number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis was more than in 1943. The London County Council's Mass Miniature Radiography Unit for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis was available in April for two months 10 South Eastern Hospital for the examination of Camberwell workers. 1123 men and 867 women volunteers employed In industrial undertakings in the Borough were examined. The number of cases referred to the employees own medical attendant following the X-Ray examination as "probably suffering from tuberculosis" was:- Males 11, Females 7. The Council decided during the year to bring within the Home Helps Scheme, cases of sickness of mothers who have living with them children under five years of age for whose care no alternative arrangements can be made, always provided that the needs of expectant and nursing mothers have already been met. Every endeavour was made to add to the number of persons on the panel available for these services to meet the requirements of this extension of the Scheme, but without success. Consequently it has not been possible to implement the Council's desire to extend the Service in the manner indicated. Indeed, it frequently happens that the demands of the expectant mothers cannot be met in view of the small number of Home Helps available to undertake the duties of these appointments. The problem of the illegitimate child also received attention by the Council and a Scheme was adopted embodying the recommendations submitted by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to the Constituent Councils in the interest of uniformity of practice throughout the Metropolis. The principal features of the Scheme are guaranteed payments by the local authority to Poster Mothers for their services and closer co-operation between the Moral Welfare Worker of the Southwark Diocesan Association and the Public Health Department in all matters affecting the mother and her illegitimate child. The Ministry of Health Circular on the care of Premature Infants was also reviewed and instructions were given for the weight of the baby at birth to be included in future in the particulars required to be furnished by a person giving notice of the birth of a child and for arrangements to be made as far as possible for the admission of selected cases to hospital. Close co-operation exists between the Maternity Units of the various hospitals receiving Camberwell mothers for confinement and the Public Health Department. On leaving hospital, these infants are closely followed up by the Health Visitors, Two of the twelve War-time Nurseries in the Borough were irreparably damaged by flying bombs during the year and a Rest Centre Nursery was temporarily closed as a result of enemy action damage. The Nurseries destroyed received children in the 0-5 years of age group. A deputy matron and nursery nurse were loaned for temporary service at Nurseries outside London in view of the exodus of mothers and children from the Borough during Fly-bombing. The nursing staff of the War-time Nurseries were examined at the Tuberculosis Dispensary in accordance with the suggestions made by the Ministry of Health in their Circular 111/44. Miss K. Harris, a temporary Health Visitor was at the request of the Ministry of Health loaned to supplement the health visiting staff at Northampton. In conclusion I wish to thank the members of the Cornell and the Chairmen of the Standing Committees for their continued support and encouragement and the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal co-operation throughout the year. I am, your obedient servant, H. W. BARNES. MEDICAL OFFICER OP HEALTH. 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS. FOR THE YEAR 1944.

RODENT CONTROL SCHEME. A comprehensive scheme was launched in the early part of the year to deal with the rat infestation of the Borough. The preliminary work of obtaining and training staff for the surface treatment of the Borough on "Block Control" lines as advocated by the Ministry of Food commenced in December, 1943. A separate Office at the Camberwell Municipal Baths, a bait preparing room and a stores building adjoining the Baths were provided for the purposes of the Scheme One of the Council's Sanitary Inspectors was appointed as Rodent Officer who devotes the whole of his time to the duties arising from the investigation of complaints and the organisation of the work of surface treatment of the Borough. Co-operation was maintained with the Borough Engineer's Department to ensure the treatment of sewers when "Block" treatments were in progress. To assist the Rodent Officer a staff of 3 clerical assistants, 3 investigators and 8 operators were engaged. The Borough was divided into 38 areas and 10 special areas were formed. During the year 320 surveys and inspections were made by the Rodent Officer, 18,240 calls were made by the Investigators and 11,878 visits were paid by the Operators. The number of baits laid was 20,929 and traps were set whore necessary. At the end of the year 21 areas had been treated and 3 were in the course of treatment. In conformity with the Ministry of Food directions the initial treatment of sewers in the Borough was followed in February by a second treatment. There were 614 complaints received during the year at the Public Health Department of the presence of rats at premises in the Borough which received attention. As a result of Fly-bomb raids in the summer months the work of the Scheme was slowed down by the withdrawal of the majority of the staff for duties connected with rehousing of bombed-out families and furniture storage.
