Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the 95th Annual Report upon the health of the Borough of Lambeth. The general health of the population has been good and the mortality among children has been almost negligible from dangerous infectious diseases which have been conspicuously absent. The Registrar General has estimated the population to be 229,100 which is some 1,900 less than in the previous year. The birth rate was 15.40, again lower than the previous year, but the general mortality rate at 12.86 per 1,000 population is nearly a point higher than in 1950. There has been an increase again in the coloured population (luring the year mainly from Jamaica and West Africa, which is presenting a problem the answer to which is still awaited. The Council requested the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to take action on their behalf and consultations have been held with officials of the Ministry of Local Government and Planning and with the Colonial Office. More special action has as a result been taken to prevent stowaways from reaching the British Isles, but these are a relatively small minority of the newcomers. Coloured members of populations in the British Empire are rightly entitled to a British passport and if they are able to land here they are entitled to stay and to enjoy also all the benefits of the Welfare State. Their way of life is so different from ours, however, that they are unable to mix easily, quite apart from the colour question. The higher standard of living here which they enjoy whether in work or no is an attraction which encourages others to follow their friends to Britain. They are cold-shouldered in some directions and encouraged, almost pampered, in others and are almost always at odds with the white population. Whether the practical solution accepted and adopted by France will ever be favoured here is a matter of conjecture, but theproblem is here, a small one now, but growing. It would seem to be expedient to attack it before it assumes the proportions reached in other parts of the world. There have been a number of retirements and resignations from the Sanitary Inspectors since the war. and replacement is increasingly difficult. The present number is still one short out of nineteen. The course of training for the qualifying certificate is longer and the examination more difficult than it was before the war, and wider knowledge is required. The scale of salary fixed by the Whitley Council has not kept pace with modern trends and is not high enough to attract students whose numbers have fallen steeply in the last two years. It is to be 4 hoped that the efforts now being made to effect an improvement will not meet with further delay, I would draw the attention of all members of the Council to the valuable work done by the staff of the Public Health Department, and particularly to the extra work undertaken in consequence of the vacancies in the Inspectorial staff. I am glad to express my gratitude for the consideration and help so readily accorded by the Chief Officers of the Council and to thank the Public Health Committee and other members of the Council for their assistance and understanding. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant. July. 1952. 5 STAFF of the PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT at 31st DECEMBER, 1951. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH A. G. G.

The natural increase by births over deaths was 882. The following table shows the actual numbers and the percentages of deaths in various age groups and no less than 39. 29% of all deaths were in the age group 75 years and over. The tendency for many years has been towards an increase of the average age at death and now almost two persons out of five are living more than five years beyond three score years and ten. Old people who tend to give up the struggle and drift towards insanitary habits and conditions are still a great difficulty but the outstanding efforts of the Lambeth Old People's Welfare Association, with its 23 clubs, have saved and continue to save many from degradation. In close co-operation with the Association the 'Meals-on-Wheels' service provides many old people with a hot meal three or four days a week, while the geriatric unit at the South Western Hospital is doing great work in putting old people back on their feet after they have taken to bed for some cause or other. An old person who stays in bed for a few days from any cause frequently finds the effort to get up again too much without the expert help they get when admitted for a few days to hospital.

(33.65) of the total deaths, cancer 5 2 3 (485) or 17.75 per cent. (17.80), and influenza, bronchitis and pneumonia, three causes of death largely dependent upon the weather, were the cause of 501 (316) deaths or 17.0 per cent. ( 11. 6). During the year the number of live births corrected by inward and outward transfers was 3, 829, giving a corrected birth rate of 16.71 compared with 16.77 in 1950, a decrease of 0.06 per 1.000 population. Tuberculosis of the lung has now been exceeded by new growths or cancers of the lung as a cause of death. The tabulation of causes of death has been changed for the years 1950 and 1951 and the fresh statistics disclose that there would appear to be cause for some concern.

MATERNAL MORTALITY The maternal mortality is expressed as the number of deaths attributed to puerperal and post abortive sepsis and other maternal causes for each 1,000 births. There were two maternal deaths during the year, a number too small for any rate comparison to be made. 10 CAUSES OF AND AGES AT DEATH (CORRECTED) DURING 1951 MORTALITY 12.86 (11.91) CAUSES OF DEATH AGES (both sexes) TOTALS Under 1 year 1 and under 5 years 5 and under 15 years 15 and under 25 years 25 and under 45 years 45 and under 65 years 65 and under 75 years 75 and upwards MALE FEMALE 1.

Total number of inspections 13.902 Total number of reinspections 28,385 Total number of intimation notices served 4.778 Total number of nuisance notices served 2,075 Women Sanitary Inspectors. Total number of visits and inspections (factories, workplaces, infectious disease, etc.) 2,074 Total number of revisits 294 Total number of intimation notices served 47 Total number of nuisance notices served 1 Workshops in which defects were found 47 The lot of the owner of ageing property is one of hardship so great that numbers are unable to find money to carry out the repairs required by the sanitary notices. In such cases after the order of the Court has been ignored the Council step in and do the work themselves and recover the cost by collecting the rent. At the end of the year there were 58 cases outstanding from which some €4,320 was owing, while in the 24 other cases the estimated cost of works approved but not yet completed was £1,690 SCABIES AND VERMINOUS PERSONS Cleansing Centre. A total of 249 persons were treated at the cleansing station and given 304 treatments, compared with 231 persons treated in the previous year. The number of cases of scabies notified. 43. compares with 40 in 1950. 68 in 1949, 125 in 1948, 310 in 1947. 758 in 1946 and 851 in 1945. More settled conditions of life and modern treatments have both conduced to this end. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS. 1948 and 1951 Section 47. Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. It is a relief to report that it was not necessary for any certificates to be made out for the removal and detention of any person during the year. There were a few cases in which it was feared that action would become necessary, but happily all died in the peace and comfort of their home surroundings. 15 Section 50. Burial or Cremation of the Dead. Arrangements were made during the year for the burial of 43 cases, of whom 24 were males, 16 were females and 3 were newly born (1 male and 2 females). 40 were Lambeth cases and 3 were strangers. The net cost to the Council was £448. THE PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS During the year 1951, 865 complaints have been investigated. Of these, 642 were found to be brown (common) rats, 17 black (ship) rats. 136 mice, and 70 were found to be not justified; 1,010 baitings were carried out, and in 83 cases defective or disused drains were found to be the cause of infestations and were dealt with by the Borough Engineer and the Sanitary Inspectors. No major infestations have come to light during the year. There has been a further reduction in the number of black rat infestations, and in no case has the infestation been of a serious character. Inspections 986 Revisits 1.033 Intimation Notices served nil Drainage Notices served 6 Once again, two separate sewer treatments with poison have been carried out by the Borough Engineer's department during the year in conjunction with the rodent officer and his staff. There are every year a number of complaints of the presence of many insects, and during the year ants clothes moths, cockroaches. steam flies drugstore beetles, various weevils, woodboring beetles and many others were the occasion of nuisances to ratepayers. REHOUSING AND OVERCROWDING 1,980 cases were examined and reports sent to the County Council with copies to the Borough Council s rehousing department. Of this number 109 Orange forms (overcrowding) were forwarded to the County Council and 74 preferential forms on medical grounds. For the Council s housing department priority recommendations numbered 52. and no preference 180.. Information upon 63 cases was forwarded to other districts. Cases not overcrowded and without need for preference numbered 901, deferred cases for which no immediate grounds for giving preference was possible were 161. Points on the Council s scheme were recommended in 81 cases where the application was reinforced with a medical certificate. Consultation with the family doctor is often required in order to elucidate the exact need. The 246 remaining cases were those in which no change in circumstances was discovered on revisiting. As a result of these activities the County Council rehoused during the year 90 Orange form and 156 preferential cases. 16 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD This part of the report deals with the work carried out by the Food Inspectors under The Food and Drugs Act, 1938, The Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. 1949 and 1950, and The Ice cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947. 1. Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) For Chemical analysis. Number procured formally 200 Number procured informally 1,800 Of the 200 formal samples, 181 were of milk, none of which shewed adulteration.

The general standard of cleanliness in food shops everywhere is higher than it has been but still leaves much to be desired. Where there is a recognised bacteriological and chemical standard, as there is now for ice cream, it is expected that all the samples taken will be found in grades 1 and 2; it is increasingly rare to find grade 3, and still more, grade 4 results. Applications to Join the Association have now reached 291 with 32 cancellations, and of these 199 have been approved by the Executive Committee as the premises comply with the requirements of the Association. The number of certificates issued is 266 of which 33 have been surrendered as the members have gone out of business. The number of badges worn by employees is now 454. Swabs of fingers are taken at irregular intervals by the sanitary inspectors for examination for faecal Bacillus coli. Of the 683 taken 16 only have yielded a growth of faecal organisms and no member has offended twice. 4.

Food Poisoning There have been 47 cases of food poisoning notified during the year none of which were found to have been connected with any other case. In only one was a food poisoning organis' recognised and that was Typhi murium isolated from the patient and also from the remains of duck" s eggs eaten by her. 19 6. Slaughterhouses. There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the district in which only two pigs were slaughtered during the year. SMOKE EMISSION During the year 18 complaints were received of nuisance from smoke from factory shafts. With the active co-operation of firms and the Ministry of Fuel and Power it has been possible in several instances to improve the quality of the fuel supplied. In one instance in particular great improvement has been effected by the installation of grit arrestors, and an additional shaft, which with the supply of better fuel has practically eliminated smoke emission there. OFFENSIVE TRADES Establishment Orders have been granted to two companies who carry on the offensive trades respectively of (a) fellmonger and (b) fatboiler. (a) Messrs. Gaston Morrell. Ferndale Road. (b) Messrs. Lepard Wandsworth Road. These two orders are renewable annually. An application was received from another fellmonger who had established the trade without first obtaining consent, thinking apparently that the approval of the Board of Trade and the dollar earning aspect was all sufficient. The factory, however, was so close to dwellings directly abutting upon the yards behind them that complaints of smell and blow flies were bound to be made sooner or later. The Public Health Committee heard both the company and the complaining ratepayers and after most careful consideration found themselves obliged to refuse consent to the establishment of the offensive trade in that factory. DRAINAGE PLANS All plans are registered with the Borough Engineer but the Sanitary Inspectors are responsible for seeing that the work is carried out in accordance with the drainage by-laws. 24 plans of new buildings and 91 plans of alteration to existing drains were deposited. In addition combined drainage was carried out in 15 cases of which 3 were cases of relaying defective combined drains for which no order had been made by the Council and no Plans could be found and which therefore were deemed to be sewers repairable by the Council. 20 RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ACTS Applications were made accompanied by the statutory fee of one shilling for the issue of 26 certificates enabling the statutory tenant to withhold a portion of the rent and for the issue of 17 determining certificates to cancel corresponding enabling certificates previously issued. DANGEROUS STRUCTURES Information was forwarded to the District Surveyor on 127 occasions during the year of the presence of structures which were considered to be dangerous to life or limb. REGISTRATIONS Under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, 120 distributors of milk and 19 dairies were registered. Under the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations . 1949 and the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 there were 122 registrations with 14 supplementary licences and two Pasteurisers licences. The number registered under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 (Section 21) Part II was 195. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. Under the provisions of this Act 11 premises were registered during the year. EXHUMATION ORDERS The Home Secretary issued an order for the removal of human remains from one grave in the district to another. The sanitary inspector was present to see that the terras of the order were fulfilled and that no nuisance or danger to the public health was permitted. STREET MARKETS Markets are held in The Cut, Lower Marsh, Lambeth Walk anil Wilcox Road in the inner wards, and in Popes Road, Electric Avenue and Brixton Station Road. All these are inspected regularly. HOUSING ACT, 1936 The work carried out under this Act during the year presented a considerable increase beyond any previous post war years. 144 detailed inspections of premises were made, arising out of which in 32 cases it was found necessary to take informal or official action to acquire the desired results. 21 (a) Closing Orders. Closing orders after representation were made on two premises, while an undertaking was given in respect of one other property. In addition, one closing order was made by a magistrate's order under the Public Health (London) Act. 1936. (b) Demolition Orders. 7 demolition orders were made during the year after representation in 1950, and the premises were all demolished during the year. In one other case the premises were demolished before the order was made but after representation in 1950. One property was demolished as a result of a demolition order Dade in 1950 but not enforced for the time being. 10 other premises were demolished during the year after representation in previous years, but which were not made the subject of demolition orders for various reasons. (c) Underground rooms and parts of buildings made fit. 5 underground rooms or parts of buildings were made fit after the closing orders and undertakings had been made operative. In one case an undertaking had been operative since 1937. (b) Clearance areas. 2 small clearance areas, involving 19 premises, were inspected for subsequent representation. HOUSING ACT. 1949 Some survey work has been carried out under Section 20 of this Act in respect of facilities afforded for loans to private persons for improvement of housing accommodation.

The water supply for the area is provided almost entirely by the Metropolitan Water Board, but there are a few deep wells of which some supply water for purposes other than human consumption, while in a few cases the supply is used for potable purposes both for drinking on the premises as well as for the manufacture of beverages and for similar trade purposes. In these latter cases a comprehensive examination of the supply both bacterio logical as well as chemical is made every three months at least, which is deemed sufficient for ample warning of any serious changes to be observed before there is danger to health. PREVALENCE OP AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES The mortality from infectious disease was again almost neglible scarlet fever 0, diptheria 0, measles 1, and whooping cough 3. Although immunisation against whooping cough is by no means certain, even with the best prophylactics now in use because it is at present a more dangerous disease than diptheria it is no doubt expedient to satisfy the demand for immunisation against both diseases. If not there is a possibility that immunisation against diptheria may be less diligently sought. Poliomyelitis Although 12 notifications were received only 11 were confirmed cases of poliomyelitis, the rate per 1 000 population being 0.05. Six of them were non paralytic and there were no deaths, In no instance was it possible to trace any contact with another case. Puerperal pyrexia Of the 51 cases followed up, 43 had attended an ante-natal clinic, while 6 who did not had abortions or miscarriages. 29 were primiparae, 20 multiparae and the parity of the other 2 has not been ascertained. The cause of the pyrexia was unknown in 13 cases, but 9 were due to mastitis, 5 each to caesarean and instrumental delivery, 2 each to prematurity, retained placenta, sepsis and stillbirth with macerated foetus, one each to breech delivery, twin pregnancy, ruptured perineum, post-partum haemorrhage, and pleurisy. 26 Tuberculosis Notifications received during the year ended 31st December, 1951. Respiratory 396 (400) Non-respiratory 31 (31) Deaths certified 103 (100) The notifications per 1,000 population for the past nine years ( 1943-51) have been 2.21, 2.28, 2.24, 1.16, 1.68, 1.63, 2.01, 1.87, 1.86.

E. and S. W. Regional Hospital Boards united to carry out a survey of the borough from the 17th October to the 19th December. Assistance was given in selecting premises for booking centres which were sited at the Town Hall, at the Council's Libraries, and at five local shops and stores. The units were set up at the Town Hall, St. Luke's Parish Hall, West Norwood and Alford House, Kennington, and the most mobile unit visited factories, schools and other sites in various parts of the area. Number photographed 31,589 Number recalled for large photograph 1, 478 Number normal on large film 413 Number abnormal on large film. 1,041 On analysis of these last, 230 were probably significant new cases of tuberculosis, 48 were to be followed up by mass x-ray later, 150 were non tuberculous cases for further investigation 40 were previously known cases, 73 were heart lesions, 462 were abnormalities requiring no action and 38 cases were still under examination. DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT 3,057 rooms and 4,006 articles of bedding and clothing were disinfected during the year, among them being the rooms and articles used by the 474 cases of various forms of infectious disease taken to hospital; 235 certificates of disinfection were issued, and 119 library books dealt with from the 4,536 premises visited during the year. The clean van was used regularly for the delivery of stores to the day nurseries and to the welfare Centres. 531 houses were treated for bed bugs and in them 1,436 separate rooms were sprayed with Vermicine, a preparation of 5 per cent. D. D. T. with Pyrethrum as a 'Knock out*. It was necessary to treat 85 houses a second time. M 136 Printed by Lambeth Borough Council.
