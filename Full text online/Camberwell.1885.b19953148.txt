They include the trenches opened by the various Gas and Water Companies, Builders, and other parties, the cost of which work is charged to them respectively. The more important repairs are carried out under a special contract. The quantity of such work during the past year has been as under: General repairs by Vestry (including trenches) 30,790 yards super. Special ditto by Contractor 4,339 ditto 9 ROAD WATERING. The watering of the public roads of the Parish as heretofore has been done by the staff and plant of the Vestry; the water supply being obtained in part from the local water companies and partly from wells in various roads in the lower districts. The following is an account of the mileage and cost of the water supply: Source of Water Supply for Road Watering. Length of Road Watered. Cost. Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company Miles. £ s. #] 55* 838 13 10 Lambeth Water Company 545 16 6 Kent Water Oompany 135 0 0 29 Wells sunk in the lower districts of the Parish by the Vestry, and also from the Grand Surrey Canal 35½ 42 0 0 Lewisham Board of Works (Moiety Sydenham Hill) ... 44 12 3 90½ £ 1,606 2 7 *Note—The amounts paid to the Water Companies for the 55 miles represents an expenditure of about £28 per mile, per annum.

Those by the Southwark and Vauxhall and Lambeth Water Companies are by meter, thus— The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Co. supply water at 8½d. per 1,000 gallons. The Lambeth Water Co. at 8½d. per 1,000 gallons in the low district; 1s. per 1,000 gallons in the midlevel; and 1s. 3d. per 1,000 gallons in the high-level district, near the Crystal Palace. The Kent Water Co. charge as arranged, for 42/3 miles of road for the sum of £135. SLOPPING, WATERING, &c. This work has been satisfactorily continued by the Vestry plant, &c., which has averaged as follows:— Horses 75 Water Vans 69 Water Carts 9 Material Carts 32 Slop Carts 40 Slop Vans 12 Horse Road Brooms 4 Horse Road Roller 1 Steam Road Roller 1 Corn Van 1 The cost of fodder, &c. for the year, for the horses in this department has amounted to £2,974 16s. 7d., being an average cost per week, per horse, of las. 3d. The consumption of the fodder per week per horse has been— Clover, Mixture, and Hay 2.28 trusses. Straw (including bedding) 1.63 „ Oats 2.58 bushels. Beans 0.20 „ Bran 10.00 lbs. 11 The total expenditure under the head of Slopping, Watering, &c., amounts to £13,832 3s. 6d., which includes, in addition to the ordinary expenses, the charge for the Barging away the Slop, which in the past year amounted to the sum of £2,044 15s. 6d. The cost of this work for the past year is as follows: Gross total expenditure £13,832 3 6 Deduct therefrom the expense for the cartage of material, road rolling, and all incidental (other than slopping and watering) 2,223 14 0 Nett cost of watering and slopping £11,608 9 6 Being about £130 per mile. The quantity of Slop collected was:— Road Slop 26,300 loads. Gulley Slop 2,003 „ Total 28,303 „ (In 1884-5 the quantity was 23,077 loads). BARGING OF SLOP AND ROAD REFUSE. These works under two special contracts have been carried out by Mr. Stephenson of Chelsea, and Messrs. Shelbourne & Co., of Limehouse. The quantity removed by barge amounted to 21,164 cart-loads. 12 Messrs. J. Shelbourne & Co.'s contract (from Midsummer, 1885, to Midsummer, 1886), for such removal is: Per cart-load, delivered direct into barges 1s. 11d. (Mem.—A Van-load is = to 1½ cart-loads.) Mr. Stephenson's contract was at 2s. per cart-load. SNOW REMOVAL On the occasion of two snow storms during the last Winter, as many additional hands were employed as practically could be utilized for the purpose, and all the vehicles and horses in the Vestry's charge. The snow sweeping and carting was principally confined to the clearing of the footways and water tables (preparing for a thaw) and the headways of all collateral main streets. The principal difficulty arose (as it does throughout the entire Metropolis) from the absence of shoots for depositing the snow; this was, however, to a great extent overcome by taking advantage of any open and wide spaces in the Parish thoroughfares for the purpose of temporary deposit, and when the thaw set in, all objectionable portions of such deposits were carted to the Depot and barged away. The Slop tanks at Glengall Wharf did goodservice, also as a means of deposit, and the filtering arrangement (therein provided) assisted much this work, and also decreased very considerably the ultimate quantity to be barged away. PARLIAMENTARY DEPOSITATIONS. No Schemes or Plans for the same were deposited in November last, but reference may conveniently be made 13 to those enumerated in the Report 1884-5, shewing the results of such propositions:— Last Year's Report.

Plans and Sections have been submitted to the Vestry for the following proposed Sewers, which, being approved, were submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works for sanction as required by statute. The works when carried out by the applicants are supervised by the officers of the Vestry. Pipe Sewers. Feet. Cowan Street 250 Aulay Street 470 Moncrieff Street 250 Clifton Crescent 730 1,700 NEW GULLIES. 74 Gullies for road drainage have been constructed in connection with all the foregoing works as and where; necessary. GULLY CLEANSING. The Gullies throughout the parish are regularly emptied and cleansed by the men employed for the purpose by the Vestry; and, during the hot summer months, they are frequently deoderised and receive special attention according to the state of the weather. The number of Gullies emptied were 4,234, 2,003 loads of Slopping being emoved therefrom. 61 SEWER CLEANSING. The Local Main Sewers are kept free from deposit and heavy matter by the gang of Flushers in the Vestry's service. The quantity of sewer slop removed during the past year has been 153 loads. All sewers vested in the Vestry are in thorough repair and working efficiently. HOUSE DRAINAGE. 203 applications have been received for the drainage of 642 houses into the sewers, and the works in connection therewith have been duly inspected. REMOVAL OF DUST. This work has been carried out as before by means of the plant, horses, &c., of the Vestry. The quantity collected during the past year ending Lady Day, 1886 21,582 loads. Do, do. 1885 21,222 „ Increase in the year 360 „ The cost of the work has been £4,735 6 9 Less amount received for Dust sold 12 13 6 Nett cost for the year £4,722 13 3 Equal to about 4s. 5d. per load. 62 This work has been contracted for, but has resulted in an increase of expenditure in this department against that of last year, which was an average cost of 3s. 9d. per load of collection and removal. Nearly the entire collection has had to be barged away at a cost of about 1s. 6d. per load, resulting in the cost averaging 4s. 4d. per load, as against the above quoted last year's cost of 3s. 9d., and which expense will be further augmented in the forthcoming year by an additional 1s. per load for barging only. This increased cost of the Dust removal is becoming serious. A Sub-Committee of the Sewers and Sanitary Department has the matter under their consideration, and the Surveyor is also engaged in making lull enquiries into the various methods of the disposal of house refuse, &c. All this will be fully reported on to the Vestry as soon as practicable. PUBLIC URINALS. Four additional Urinals have been erected during the year. All these Urinals are regularly cleansed by the labourers in the Vestry's employ; the water for flushing the same is supplied by the Water Companies serving the respective districts. The annual charge for the water is £6 each Urinal. The following are the respective localities in which such Urinals are situate:— 63 1. Addington Square, next High Road. 2. Caspian Street, New Church oad. 3. Denmark Hill, opposite berwell Green. 4. Havil Street, rear of Vestry Hall. 5. Hanover Street, next Rye Lane. 6. Hill Street, opposite Bird-in- Bush Road. 7. Joiners' Arms Yard, Denmark Hill. 8. Old Kent Road, opposite Oakley Place. 9. Orchard Row, Camberwell New Road. 10. Peckham High Street, site Hill Street. 11. Peckham Rye, Cross Road, near Nunhead Lane. 12. Peckham Rye, opposite " ton Arms." 13. Rotherhithe New Road, next St. James' Road. 14. Southampton Street, by Wells Street. 15. Sumner Road, next cial Road. 16. Upland Road, by Police Station. 17. Wells Street, at St. George's Bridge. 18. Wyndham Road, at Railway Bridge. VENTILATING PIPES. As a means of ventilating the local sewers, ventilating pipes have been placed at the flanks of premises adjacent to these sewers, and which have been found of great use in reducing the pressure of sewage gas emitted therefrom. The Surveyor has directions to increase the number of these ventilators wherever permission can be obtained for their erection. MORTUARY. See Vestry Clerk's report thereon. The Reports of your Medical Officer and Public Analyst are appended, shewing the various sanitary measures carried out in their departments. 65 18 8 5-8 6. MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT. Gentlemen, It may perhaps be recollected that, in my report for the year 1883, I pointed out that the death-rate of London for that year was the lowest on record, and that in my report for the year 1884, I stated that the mortuary rate for that year was even lower than that for 1883. I have to announce that the Metropolitan death-rate for 1885 is still lower than these. The death-rate for 1883 was 20.5 per 10,000 persons living; that for 1884, 20.4; that for 1885, 19.7. The Registrar-General shows that the diminished mortality for the last three years has been due, in part, to a marked falling-off in the marriage-rate, and to a consequent marked falling-off in the birth-rate; for the larger the number of labours the larger will be the number of deaths incidental to childbirth, and inasmuch as children in their first year die in much larger proportion than other persons, a large diminution in the number of births must, other things remaining The same, have a marked influence on the general death-rate, The Registrar-General, however, calculates that, due allowance being made for these influences, the death-rate for 1885 would still be only 20.0 per 1000, and would still be the lowest on record. 66 The populations of London, and of its five groups of districts, as determined at the Census of 1881, were as follows: Table I.—Populations of London and of its Groups of Districts at Census of 1881. London West D. North D. Central D. East D. South D. 3,816,483 669,633 905,947 282,238 692,738 1,265,927 The numbers have increased generally since that time, and the Registrar-General estimates that in the middle of 1885, the population of the Metropolis had reached 4,083,928, of which number 1,923,447 were males, 2,160,481 were females. Table II. gives the births and deaths, together with the birth-rates and death-rates per 1000 for the whole of London and for its groups of districts: Table II.—Births, Deaths, Birth-rates and Death-rates of London and its Groups of Districts for 1885. London West D. North D. Central D. East D. South D. Births 132,506 20,242 29,808 8,119 26,410 47,927 Deaths 80,000 13,819 18,042 6,012 16,043 26,084 Birth Rates 32.5 28.1 30.6 31.1 37.0 35.0 Death Bates 19.6 19.2 18.5 23.0 22.5 18.5 The death-rate (18.5) here assigned to South London is the lowest ever recorded for that area. It is also lower than any that has been recorded either for the whole Metropolis or for any one of its five groups of districts, until the year to which this report relates, when the northern group shewed an equal death-rate with the southern group, and shared with it the honours of the occasion. 67 The birth-rates were all somewhat lower than they were in 1884, but those of the eastern and southern districts were as usual the highest. In Table III. are recorded the deaths from each of the more important zymotic or infectious diseases in London, year by year, for the last ten years; and, for the year 1885, their distribution among the groups of districts: Table III.—Mortality of chief Zymotic Diseases in London for 10 Years. Hooping Cough. Measles. Dipththeria. Scarlet Fever. Fever. Small Pox. 1876 2,739 1,741 359 2,297 1,181 735 1877 1,780 2,347 317 1,576 1,949 2,544 1878 4,446 1,510 558 1,792 1,361 1,416 1879 3,000 2,488 592 2,706 1,099 458 1880 3,438 1,501 561 3,073 886 475 1881 1,961 2,533 654 2,108 1,196 2,371 1882 4,647 2,329 863 2,004 1,117 431 1883 1,582 2,420 951 1,989 1,081 134 1884 3,188 2,285 973 1,444 1,045 913 1885 2,479 2,928 896 707 695 899 1885 West D. 407 420 148 61 100 82 North D. 521 800 274 184 191 350 Central D. 165 197 69 38 49 12 East D. 515 774 120 120 115 51 South D. 871 737 285 285 240 404 68 The table shews a general falling-off in the mortality of these diseases as compared with the previous year. Measles alone shewed an increase, but nevertheless it was considerably less fatal in the southern districts than it was in 1884. The chief diminution was in Hooping-cough, Scarlet-fever, and Fever. There Avere 737 fewer cases of Scarlet-fever in 1885 than in 1884. It is interesting to note that all the zymotic diseases, excepting Small-pox, shewed a large decrease in the southern districts. Smallpox, however, rose from 204 to 404. Table IV. gives the actual populations of the Parish of Camberwell and of its four sub-districts as they were enumerated at the Census of 1881, and the populations calculated for the year 1885, on the assumption that the rates of increase of each district and of the parish, that prevailed between 1871 and 1881, have been maintained since: Table IY.—Populations of Cambebwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham St. George's Parish. As estimated at census of 1881. 5,590 59,104 71,089 50,810 186,593 As estimated for middle of year 1885. 6,413 77,515 88,785 60,388 232,501 It will be found that the total for the parish, in the last line, does not correspond exactly to the totals obtained by adding up the estimates for the several sub-districts. The difference is unimportant, and depends on the fact (which renders absolute agreement impossible) that the increase in each district, as also that for the entire parish, have been calculated on independent data. I must also 69 repeat the caution which I have often before expressed, that my estimates of population must be regarded as mere estimates, founded on data which are liable to variations, and therefore themselves liable to considerable error. During the year 1885, 7,173 children (3,669 boys and 3,504 girls) were born in the Parish. Of these 92 were born in Dulwich, 2,303 in Camberwell, 2,685 in Peckham, and 2,093 in St. George's. There was an increase of 3 in Dulwich, and of 15 in St. George's; but there was a fall of 99 in Camberwell, and of 59 in Peckham. The births for the whole Parish were fewer by 140 in 1885 than they were in 1884. The falling-off is slight, and is sufficiently accounted for by the fact that the Returns for 1884 included 53 weeks, while these for 1885 comprised 52 weeks only: Table V.—Births in Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham St. George's Parish. 1884 89 2,402 2,744 2,078 7,313 1885 92 2,303 2,685 2,093 7,173 Difference + 3 - 99 - 59 + 15 - 140 The birth-rates per 1000 for 1884 and 1885 are given in Table VI. It will be seen that the birth-rate has fallen in all districts except Dulwich, and that the birth-rate of Dulwich, as usual, is less than half that of any of the other districts of the Parish: Table VI.—Birth-Rates op Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's Parish. 1884 14.3 33.2 32.6 35.8 33.1 1885 14.3 29.7 30.2 34.7 30.9 G 70 The deaths registered in Camberwell during the year amounted to 3,750, of which 1,825 were of males, 1,925 of females, and of which 53 were returned from Dulwich, 1,337 from Camberwell, 1,337 from Peckham, and 1,023 from St. George's. The deaths were less numerous than those in 1884 by 18. In Dulwich there was a decrease of 2, in Camberwell of 36, and in Peckham of 22; but in St. George's there was an increase of 42 (see Table IX.). Of the 1,337 returned for the sub-district of Camberwell, 296 occurred in the Workhouse and Parochial Infirmary, and 76 in the two Lunatic Asylums, makinga total of 372 deaths which (though included in the mortuary returns of this sub-district) no more belong properly to it, than they do to the other sub-districts of the Parish. In order to determine the death-rates of the sub-districts, it is necessary to distribute these proportionately among them. This has been done in Table VII., the last column of which gives the corrected returns: Table VII.—Re-distribution of Deaths among Sub-Districts of Camberwell. Deaths returned. Deaths in W.&L.A. Deaths in W.&L.A. subtracted. Deaths in W. & L. A. redistributed. Estimates of Deaths due to Districts.'

These death-rates are furnished in Table VIII., which also presents for comparison the death-rates for 1884. Table VIII.—Death-Rates of Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's Parish. 1884 9.8 15.5 17.8 18.7 17.1 1885 9.2 13.8 16.7 18.9 16.1 It will be observed that the death-rates are, with the exception of that of St. George's, all of them lower than those of the year 1884; and in St. George's the difference is so slight as not to be worthy of notice. The death-rates are all remarkably low; and, indeed, as I remarked in my last two reports, they are so low that it is impossible not to suspect the presence of some fallacy. Not improbably my estimates of the populations are greater than the actual populations, an error which leads to an under-estimation of the mortuary-rates. Another cause of fallacy I have been enabled to deal with in my last two Annual Reports, that, namely, which arises from the deaths of parishioners in hospitals and elsewhere beyond the limits of the parish. For the last three years I have received from the RegistrarGeneral's office weekly returns of these deaths; and I have tabulated these supplemental deaths for 1885 in Table X.; they amounted to 282, of which 7 were due to Dulwich, 79 to Camberwell, 153 to Peckham, and 43 to St. George's. The addition of these deaths to those registered in the parish, and with which alone I have hitherto dealt, must necessarily increase the death-rates of the parish and of its constituent parts. Table XI. shews both the augmented deaths G 2 72 of the parish and its sub-districts due to this addition, and the augmented death-rates. The augmented death-rates are (excepting in the case of Dulwich) lower than those of the previous year, and, collectively, are amongst the lowest on record: Table XI.—Deaths and Death-Rates of Camberwell and its Sub-Districts obtained by including the 282 Deaths which occurred in hospitals and elsewhere outside the parish.

It gives also the ages at death, and the more important causes of death. As regards the effects of season on the Mortuary Returns there is not much to remark, excepting that the unusually heavy mortality of the last three months of 1884 was continued during the first three months of 1885. During the year there were 86 deaths attributed to accidental or other violence; 322 to premature birth or defective vitality continuing after birth; and 43 to child-birth. Inflammatory affections of the lungs caused 716 deaths, of which 258 occurred in the first three months of the year and 257 in the last three months. Diarrhœal affections caused 135 deaths, of which 118 happened in children under five years of age. Most of the deaths (99) occurred, as usual, during the third quarter of the year, infantile diseases were fatal in 618 cases.

Hooping-cough fell from 173 to 136; Measles from 171 to 91; Diphtheria from 78 to 68; Scarlet Fever from 82 to 20; Fever from 40 to 27; and Diarrhoea from 240 to 135. But Small-pox rose from 34 to 154, a larger mortality from this disease than Ave have had in any year excepting 1881, when the Small-pox deaths amounted to 190. There were indications in the last quarter of 1884 that an outbreak of the disease was impending; and during the first six months of 1885 it was at least as prevalent as it has been at any time since the recrudescence of the disease in 1871. 53 deaths were registered in the first quarter of the year, and 79 in the second. In the third quarter the mortality fell to 14, and in the fourth quarter to 8. As usual, Peckham suffered disproportionately; one fatal case was due to Dulwich; 24 to Camberwell: 24 to St. George's; and 105 to Peckham. 103 of these deaths occurred among patients removed to hospitals, and 51 among those who were treated -at home. It will, perhaps, be recollected that in my last annual report I referred to a limited outbreak of true Typhus, attended with one death, which occurred towards the end of the year in Verney Flats, a tenement house situated in No. 2 Ward, close to Rotherliithe, and was soon suppressed. Some months later a more serious outbreak of the disease commenced in a part of the Parish, at least a mile away from A erney Flats, separated from it by the Canal, and among persons who had had, so far as we could ascertain, no communication whatever with the locality first affected. My attention was called to the outbreak by hearing that three cases of Fever had been removed within a few days from one house in How- 74 bury road. They were reported to be Typhoid. But the circumstances of the case made me suspect that the disease was Typhus. And further enquiries on the spot, and from the medical man in attendance, confirmed my suspicion. That the disease was true Typhus was established beyond doubt by Dr. Crombie, of the South Eastern Fever Hospital, to which institution they had been removed. The first of these cases was removed on the 12th May, the other two on the 17th Subsequently four other cases of Typhus occurred, in all of which direct communication with the patients removed from Howbury road was traced; namely, one removed on the 23rd. from Greenhundred road, one removed on the 26th from the house in Howbury road already affected, and another on the 3rd July and another on the 6th, both from the same house. No further cases of the disease were discovered, and no further outbreaks of Typhus have occurred in the Parish since. These two outbreaks are curious as happening at a time when London was, and had been for a long time, almost entirely free from Typhus. We have had no real epidemic prevalence of the disease, in London, since 1862 and 1863. No other diseases call for comment. The health of the Parish, apart from the undue prevalence of Small-pox, was. unusually good. The sanitary work done by the Inspectors of Nuisances in the year ending March 25th, 1886, is given in detail in Tables XIV. and XV. It will be seen that 10,859 primary inspections were made and 6,161 second inspections; that 3,650 first notices and 270 second notices were served in respect of these inspections; and that in only 11 cases was it deemed necessary to summon the persons on whom notices had been served. 75 Among the duties performed during the year, it will he observed that one stands out prominently from a numerical point of view, namely, the cutting off of rain-water, sink, and other waste wacer pipes from drains. We have found, unfortunately, that in a large number of cases, and noticeably among houses recently built, there has been a great disregard on the part of builders of the elementary principles of sanitary construction, and that waste-water pipes have not only been connected directly with drains and sewers, but that few or no precautions to prevent the introduction by them of sewer-gas into houses have been taken. The subject is one of great practical importance, and is engaging the serious attention of the Sewers and Sr.nitary Committee. The prevalence of Small-pox during the first half of 1885 was a heavy tax on the resources of the department. When the disease had become prevalent, Mr. Sedgley was detailed to do the whole of the work connected with the disease all over the Parish, partly in order that it might be systematically done, partly to prevent any risk of the spread of Small Pox by the Inspectors. The work was very laborious, occupying the whole of each day from early morning till late at night, and entailed much mental anxiety. At the end of a week or two Mr. Sedgley broke down under it, and remained ill and unfit for work for some time. His special duties were then devolved on Mr. Stevenson, who performed them with great zeal, ability, and success, for many weeks, until, in fact, the epidemic had died out. The details of this work will be found in Tables XIV. and XV. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. S.

Such accumulation should (pending their removal) be disinfected by the free use of Chloride of Lime. 4.—All water-butts and cisterns should be kept clean and well covered. 5.—All houses, and especially the sleeping apartments, should be kept clean and well ventilated. 6.—Overcrowding should be avoided as much as possible. 81 MEASURES TO BE TAKEN WHEN SMALL POX OR FEVER OF ANY KIND IS PRESENT. 1.—Every person suffering from Small Pox or Fever should be placed as early as possible under the care of a qualified Medical Practitioner. 2.—The patient should be at once separated, as efficiently as circumstance will permit, from the other inmates of the house, and if possible, should be placed in a top room. A sheet kept wet with a solution made by thoroughly mixing a quarter of a pint of Carbolic Acid, No. 4, with a gallon of water, should be hung up outside the door. 3.—All bed-curtains and other hangings, and carpets, and all articles of dress, &c., in wardrobes and cupboards, should be removed from the room. 4.—The patient's room should be well ventilated, but not needlessly draughty; windows should be kept partially open, and the communication with the chimney free. A fire generally aids ventilation. 5.—Pieces of rag, being inexpensive, should be used for wiping discharges from the mouth and nose, and should be immediately burnt after use. 6.—A basin, containing Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or some of a solution made by dissolving a pound of Green Copperas in a gallon of water, should be kept at hand to receive the patient's spit or vomit. 7.—The discharges from the bowels or kidneys should be received into vessels charged with the same disinfectants. 82 8.—A pail, also containing solution of Chloride of Lime, or of Condy's Fluid, or of Carbolic Acid, should stand in the room for the reception of all bed and body linen after removal from the person of the patient. 9.—All glasses, cups, and other utensils should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 10.—The hands of the nurse should be washed with Carbolic Acid Soap, and rinsed in water containing Condy's Fluid : her dress should be of Cotton. 11.—All articles of dress in use by the nurse or patient, and all articles of a like kind liable to be infected, should before they are removed from the room in which the patient lies, be put into a solution of Chloride of Lime, or Condy's Fluid, or Carbolic Acid, and should afterwards be washed and boiled, or burnt. 12.—The room should be thoroughly disinfected after it has been emptied. A good plan is to burn from a quarter to half a pound of brimstone in an iron dish, supported over a pail of water in the middle of the room, the doors, windows, and other outlets having been previously closed. The room should remain closed for twenty-four hours. CAUTIONS. 1.—If any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, shall enter any public conveyance without previously notifying to the owner or driver thereof that he is so suffering, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 2.—Any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, who wilfully exposes himself, without proper precaution 83 against spreading the said disorder, in any street, public place, or public conveyance, and any person in charge of one so suffering, who so exposes the sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 3.;—Any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after it has conveyed any such sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 4.—Any person who, without previous disinfection, gives, lends, sells, transmits, or exposes any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things that have been exposed to infection from such disorders, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 5.—If any person knowingly lets any house, room, or part of a house in which a person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder has been, to any other person, without having such house, room, or part of a house, and all articles therein liable to retain infection, disinfected to the satisiaction of a qualified Medical Practitioner, as testified by a certificate given by him, such person shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. 6.—When any dead body of one who has died of any infectious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or Bleep, any Justice may, on a certificate signed by a legally qualified Medical Practitioner, order the body to be removed to a mortuary at the cost of the Nuisance authority. NOTICES. 1.—IF. ANY INFECTIOUS FEVER appears in any place information should be at once given at the Vestry Hall to the Medical Officer, or to the Inspector of Nuisances. 84 2.—COMPLAINTS AS TO NUISANCES should be made personally or by letter to the Inspectors of Nuisances, and as to Non-removal of Dust, to the Dust Superintendent at the Vestry Hall. 3.—DISINFECTANTS may be had gratis on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 4.—A DISINFECTING APPARATUS has been provided by the Vestry at the Parish Stone Yard, Peckham Park Road, at which bedding and articles of apparel may be disinfected gratis, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 5.—A MORTUARY has been provided at Forest Hill Cemetery, whither dead bodies may be at once removed, and where they may remain until the time of burial, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances.

To the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, In presenting my Report this quarter, I have to state with reference to Milk, that the number of cases prosecuted do not cover the ground as to real adulteration. More arc slightly adulterated, but the limit your Committee have fixed—which is almost exactly that of Somerset House— enables me to give a more favourable report than would otherwise be the case. Of thirty-five Milks analysed, no fewer than thirteen have been examined in duplicate. Nine of them were found to be mixed with water to the extent, respectively, of 10, 10, 13, 8, 10, 10, 12, 19 and 10 per cent. of water; so that over 25 per cent. are adulterated with water. Since my last Report a case has been referred to Somerset House. As it is interesting, I take the liberty of recording it for future reference. 11 86 It was case 210. The analysis was made in duplicate on the 12th March, and was referred to Somerset House on 10th April. I will give the analysis side by side. ] S. H. Total Solids 10.78 10.69 10.11 Water 89.22 89.31 88.89 Fat 2.77 2.74 2.76 Solids not fat 8.01 7.95 7.35 100.00 100.00 100.00 I had given the sample as containing eight per cent. of added water. The Chemists of Somerset House reported thus:— "From a consideration of these results, after making allowance for natural loss arising from the decomposition of the Milk through keeping, we are of opinion that the Milk contains not less than seven per cent. of added water." Four Breads have been examined. One of them contained 6 grains of alumina, calculated as alum. Of four Coffees, one was admixed with about fifty per cent. of chicory. Four Sugars were very good of their kind. Samples of Potted Ham, Salmon, Sardines, Roast Beef and Boiled Mutton have also been analysed. The results are distinctly interesting, but as the certificates have been examined by your Committee, I need not further refer to them, beyond mentioning how very minute is the quantity of the metal tin contained in them. 87 Michaelmas, 1885. During the past Quarter I have Analysed thirty-five 'samples of Milk, of which five were adultrated with, respectively, 33, 12, 21, 11, and 14 per cent. of water. Besides these, no fewer than nine samples are at the boundary line allowed by your Committee. The further Analyses of this Quarter comprise none but drinks. The Soda Water, four in number, are practically innocent of bi-carbonate of soda. The alkalinity of each, calculated as bi-carbonate of soda, was only respectively, 0.0008, 0.008, 0.003 and. 0.017 per cent. They were all well aerated, and remarkably free from metallic contamination. ()f the Lemonades, three out of four contained a very distinct trace of lead. The Ginger Ales furnish a very pleasant aerated drink. They were free from all metallic contamination. Two out of four are almost identical, and are probably made from the same prescription. Only one of these contained a weighable quantity of alcohol, and then but 0.05 per cent. A Ginger Beer contained over 2 per cent. of alcohol calculated as proof-spirit. Although this amount can scarcely constitute an alcholic drink, ginger beers may contain as much alcohol as many table-beers. This particular sample was perfectly free from all metallic contamination. Zoedone has completely changed its character for the better. Iron is now present in very minute quantity, instead H 2 88 of in medicinal dose. It is well aërated, phosphated, and' free from any injurious metals. Of two Ciders, both contained a trace of lead. They were of agreeable taste and sufficiently alcoholic to make them rank among beers. No. 102 contained 8, and No. 99 8.8 per cent, of alcohol, calculated as proof spirit. Of the so-called Non-intoxicating Draught Mild Ale, it is. difficult to determine the reason for the name. No ale is intoxicating if drunk in rational quantities : say half-a-pint at a meal. This particular sample contained per cent. of alcohol calculated as proof spirit. Two samples of Lager-beer conclude my list of drinks. They were very slightly bitter. No. 93 had a taste of herbs, and possessed about the average acidity of beers, the proof spirit amounted to 10.26 or 10¼ per cent. No. 100 was somewhat less alcoholic (9.72 per cent.), and rather more nutritious. Of these Lager-beers it must be said, that they are more alcoholic than those of Germany, and their introduction among ourselves can have no effect in diminishing drunkenness when taken in excess. The certificates arc in the hands of our Inspectors. Christmas, 1SS5. During the past quarter 1 have examined forty samples of Milk} ten of which were adulterated with, respectively, 6, 14, 10, 8, 14, 18, 6, 25, 5, and 15 per cent, of water. One Condensed Milk, of a new brand, was not equal to many of the 89 old brands, and was made like most of these from somewhat skimmed milk. These condensed milks are up to our standard, but that is too low, and milks with such an amount of butter fat are not to be met with. Four Breads have been examined. One of these was most suspicious of alum, but the greater exponent of the cause was not alumina, but iron. The whole of the alumina only came up to the admitted quantity per four pound loaf. All four samples of Cheese were made with genuine milk more or less skimmed, but in every case the butter fat was genuine. Of eight samples of Butter, only one was found to be almost altogether fat, other than butter fat. The certificates are all in the hands of your Inspectors. Lady-day, 188G. During the quarter just passing, I have examined forty. Milks. Besides thirteen samples which were adulterated, respectively, with 16, 9, 26, 13, 31, 7, 17, 12, 7, 15, 24, and 7 per cent. of added water; a considerable number had been tampered with, although the amount of added water just excluded them from prosecution. The undoubtedly genuine milks were Nos. 176, 177, 179, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 205, 208, 210, 211 and 212. The weather has been sadly contrary, and it is more than probable that, in many cases, the adulteration could not be; 90 successfully carried out, as it had already been accomplished as far as was safe. Of eight Butters two were counterfeits. Peppers, four in number, were excellent. All the certificates have been forwarded. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERN AYS. The above Reports are submitted to the Vestry. (Signed) J. 0. WILSON, Chairman of the Sewers and Sanitary Committee, 1885-86. T. FOSTER, Vice- Chairman. J. C. REYNOLDS, Surveyor to the Vestry.

Your Vestry Clerk begs to submit the following Report upon some of the chief questions which, have been under the consideration of the Vestry during the past year:— Bill in Parliament—DULWICH PARK. Last year the various steps taken to secure for the Parish of Camberwell, and the inhabitants of South London generally, about 72 acres of land for a public Park at Dulwich, were fully detailed in the Annual Report of the Vestry, and at the date to which that Report was brought up, the Metropolitan Board of Works had before Parliament their Various Powers Bill, containing inter alia, power to acquire by gift from the Governors of Dulwich College, the 72 acres of land referred to. On the 6th of May, 1885, the Chairman of the Vestry (E. Dresser Rogers, Esq.) was able to report that the clause in the Board's Bill had passed the Committee of the House of Commons to which it had been referred. At the same meeting it was unanimously resolved that the best thanks of the Vestry be given to Messrs. Francis Hayman Fowler, Edward Dresser Rogers, George Crispe Whiteley, James Walter, Matthew Wallace, and William Benjamin Hurst for their exertions to secure the acquisition of a Park for South London. In consequence of the great opposition subsequently made to the Bill, in the House of Lords, by the Governors of Dulwich College, who appeared by Counsel, the Vestry deemed it of 96 such importance that they appointed a Special Committee consisting of Messrs. Dresser Rogers, Turney, Whiteley, Wallace, Duckett, Middlemass, Walter, and Strong (with the Vestry Clerk) to prepare a Petition in support of the Bill, and to take all the necessary steps to have it presented. The Committee also wrote to about forty Peers of the House of Lords, enclosing a copy of the Petition, and urging them to consider the allegations contained therein, and support it. The Petition contained many details which may he interesting to the Ratepayers generally. The following is a copy: To the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in Parliament assembled. The HUMBLE PETITION of the Vestry of the Parish of Camberwell, in the County of Surrey. SHEWETH, THAT a Bill, introduced by the Metropolitan Board of Works to confer various powers on the Metropolitan Board of Works with respect to the providing of Recreation Grounds for the public and for other purposes, has passed the Honourable the House of Commons, and is now sent up to your Lordships' House. THAT by clause 41 of the said Bill it is provided that, from and after the 29th day of September, 1885, all the estate and interest of the Governors of Dulwich College respectively in or to the Dulwich College Lands, and in respect of 72 acres, shall be transferred to the Metropolitan Board by way of gift, and the same shall become vested in the Board respectively, and the Board shall hold the said lands and from time to time lay out and maintain and preserve them as a Public Park for the perpetual use thereof by the public for exercise and recreation. 97 THAT the said Bill has been introduced into Parliament by the Metropolitan Board of Works to carry into effect the offer of the Estates Governors of Dulwich College to appropriate and give to that Board 72 acres of land for the purpose of providing a Public Park which is most eligibly situated for the use and enjoyment of the inhabitants of South London. THAT the said 72 acres of land are part of 1,200 acres of freehold land possessed by the Governors of Dulwich College, and which they have laid out for building purposes. Houses have been and are now being extensively erected thereon, while no part of the said land has been hitherto laid out by the Governors for a Recreation Ground or open space. THAT the said Dulwich College Act, passed in 1857, transferred the said Estate from the Master, Wardens, and Fellows of Dulwich College to the Governors of the College. The number of inhabitants of the Hamlet of Dulwich then was only 1,122, while up to the present time it has increased to 6,300, and is still rapidly increasing. The population of your Petitioners' parish (which includes the Hamlet of Dulwich) and of the parishes of Lambeth, Newington, St. George the Martyr, St. Saviour, Southwark, and St. Olave, which comprise the greater part of South London, have increased during 10 years, from 1871 to 1881, as follows:— 1871. 1881 Increase. Camberwell 111,306 186,593 75,287 Lambeth 208,312 253,699 45,357 Newington 87,722 107,850 20,128 St. Saviour 175,349 195,164 20,115 St. Olave 122,398 134,632 12,234 704,817 877,938 173,121 98 THAT the population of these parishes have, since the taking of the last census in 1881, still further increased, and all these parishes are without a Public Park. Your Petitioners therefore respectfully submit that the offer of the said Governors to appropriate 72 acres of land for a Public Park is a great boon to the Inhabitants of these densely populated Parishes. YOUR Petitioners learn that, in the year 1805, about 130 acres were allotted to the Master, Wardens and Fellows of Dulwich College, under 45 Geo. III., c. 102:—"An Act for enclosing lands in the Manor of Dulwich," free of all cost, and at that time no open space or Recreation Ground was allotted by the Commissioners under the Act, for the use of the inhabitants; which fact, your Petitioners submit, is a valid and just ground for the Governors appropriating part of the 130 acres to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the purpose of a Park. YOUR Petitioners earnestly hope that the Bill having so good an object as that of providing and dedicating to the use of the Public, a Park, to be kept and maintained by the Metropolitan Board of Works, may become law. YOUR PETITIONERS therefore humbly pray that your Lordships may be pleased to pass such a Bill, and that it may become law. AND YOUR PETITIONERS WILL EVER PRAY, &C. This Petition,when engrossed on parchmcnt,was forwarded to the Right Hon. the Earl of Rosebery, with a request that he would, on behalf of the Vestry, present it to the House of Lords. The Committee also specially sought the aid of Lord Brabazon, the President of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, specially requesting his assistance, and receiving his promise to help in any way that might be suggested. By request of the Solicitor to the 99 Metropolitan Board of Works, your Committee also sent copies of the Petition for the use of Sir James McGarel Hogg, M.P., the Chairman of the Board, in the event of the matter coming again before the House of Commons. On the 6th of August it was reported to the Vestry that the gift of the land was approved by the House of Lords, and that the Bill would duly receive the Royal Assent. The Vestry took the opportunity of according their cordial thanks to Francis Peek, Esq., a Governor of Dulwich College, who had rendered most important assistance in giving valuable evidence in support of the Bill, and by his zeal and influence had contributed to the successful passing of the measure. The Metropolitan Board of Works have already taken steps to lay out the Park, but to enable them to do so it became necessary to stop up or divert certain public pathways crossing the Park, and it was reported to the Vestry that an arrangement had been made by the Board to obtain statutory powers authorising them to re-convey to the Governors of the College about 1¾ acres of the land for the Park. The Vestry took energetic action to oppose such powers being conferred on the Board, and ultimately fresh arrangements were made so that the whole of the land was -secured for the public for their use and enjoyment for ever. Bill in Parliament.— ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIVE AT THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. The Mteropolis Management Acts Amendment Bill was originally promoted by the Lewisham District Board of Works with the object of obtaining increastd representation at the Metropolitan Board of Works for the Vestries and District Boards of Paddington, Camberwell, Kensington, Wandsworth, and Hackney, and separate representation for the 100 Lewisham District Hoard. Subsequently the Bill was amended in the House of Commons to provide for the election to the Board of three representatives for the Parishes of St. Mary, Islington, Lambeth, St. Pancras, St. Mary Abbott, Kensington, and the Wandsworth District Board of Works; two for the Vestries of Camberwell and Paddington, and the Board of Works of Greenwich, Hackney, and Poplar, and separate representation for the District Boards of Plumstead and Lewisham and Fulham and Hammersmith. The Vestry fully concurred in the objects of the Bill, and endeavoured to induce the Metropolitan Board to take charge of it. Failing this, the Vestry, in conjunction with the Lewisham Board and the other Boards and Parishes interested, sent a Deputation to wait upon Sir Charles Mills, M.P. In compliance with the request of the Deputation, Sir Charles Mills and Viscount Lewisham, M.P., undertook to endorse the Bill and introduce it into the House of Commons. The Bill, which as thus finally amended increases the total number of Members of the Board (including the Chairman) from 16 to 60, was subsequently passed by the House of Lords, and became law on July 31st, 1885. At a meeting of the Vestry on September 30th, Mr. Andrew Middlemass was duly elected the first additional representative of this Parish, under the new Act, for the ensuing three years. This Parish is, therefore, now ably represented at the Board by Mr. Edward Dresser-Rogers and Mr. Middlemass. ARTISANS' AND LABOURERS' DWELLINGS ACTS. The Sewers and Sanitary Committee have, from time to time, had under their consideration the condition of certain property in Lower Park Road, Park Street, and Grainger Street, and in October last the Medical Officer reported to the vestry, under the Artisans and Labourers' Dwellings 101 Improvement Acts, that he found the houses numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, on the east side of Lower Park road, those numbered 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17, on the west side of Park Street, and that numbered 1a, Grainger Street, in a state or condition dangerous to health so as to be unfit for human habitation. The vestry, in further accordance with the Statutes above mentioned, referred the Report to the Surveyor to the Vestry to consider the cause of the evil so reported on and the remedy thereof; and if such evil is occasioned by defects in the said premises, whether it can be removed by structural alterations and improevments or otherwise, and whether the said premises, or any, and what part thereof, ought to be demolished. The Surveyor subsequently reported that in his opinion no structural alterations or improvements could be made in the premises so as to make them fit for human habitation, and that tehy ought to be demolished. The Vestry, in compliance with the requirements of the Act, gave notice to all parties interested to attend the meeting of the Vestry on the 12th of May, to state their objections to the Reports of the Medical Officer and Surveyor. Many of them attended and stated the tenures under which they held the property, and also their objections to the Reports. The Vestry have adjourned the further consideration of the question from time to time, at the request of some of those interested, and to enable them through their Surveyor, to submit plans and suggestions for such improvements of the property as will put it in a sanitary condition. The Vestry hope that some means may be devised which will obviate the demolition of the property, and the consequent loss to the owners. OVERHEAD WIRES. The attention of the Vestry had been frequently directed to the possibility of danger arising from the rapid increase of I 102 Telephone and Telegraph Wires stretched over houses and across streets, and to the uncertainty upon whom the responsibility would lie in case of accident. The importance of this question generally engaged the attention of the London Vestries, and more especially that of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Board were invited by the Local Authorities to take some action in the matter. As the United Telephone Company had, in the early part of the year, a Bill before Parliament asking for further powers, the Board petitioned the House that before Telephone Wires were laid in the Metropolis, the Board's sanction should be obtained, and further, that the wires should be laid to the satisfaction of the Vestries and District Boards. The House of Commons considering the growing importance of the matter, referred it to a Select Committee, who notified that they would hear three witnesses to give representative evidence of the views of the aggregate London Vestries. Thereupon a letter was received from the Vestry of Lambeth inviting Delegates to a Conference at which to select three witnesses to represent to the Select Committee the views of the Vestries on the subject. The Vestry, on the 7th of April, appointed Mr. Andrew Middlemass, Mr. John Wilson, and Mr. Matthew Wallace as Delegates to such Conference. The Select Committee having taken the evidence of representatives of the Local Authorities, the Post Office, and various Telephone undertakings, made a Report to the House on the 12th of May, explaining the present unsatisfactory condition of the Law on the subject, and offering the following suggestions: That the Postmaster-General should be authorised to give notice of the intention to erect any Telegraphic Line 103 before, if he should think fit, instead of after obtaining the consent of the road authority. That all persons, including the road authority, desiring to object, should send in their objections to the Postmaster-General within a stated period. That the objections should be referred to the County Court Judge, who should be empowered to make an order authorising the erection of the line on such conditions as might be deemed just, and that if an appeal were thought necessary it should be made to the Railway Commissioners. The Select Committee further suggested that the Postmaster-General should be allowed to make attachments to private property with the consent of the occupier, but that the occupier's consent should hold good during the term of his occupation only; that the provisions of the existing Acts, inconsistent with the foregoing suggestions fchould be repealed, and especially the provision requiring the Postmaster-General to obtain the consent of the occupier of every dwelling-house within 30 feet of a pole. The Telephone Companies, it was explained, acted under the license of the Postmaster-General, to whom they paid a royalty, and the Committee recommended that the licensees of the Post Office should have the same powers with regard to the running of their wires as the Postmaster-General; subject, however, to the proviso that their wires should not be allowed to interfere with those required for the general public telegraphic servicc. The Select Committee was of opinion that, under proper regulations, permission should be given to pass wires over property without the owners or occupiers having the right of prohibition; but that this facility should not confer upon those enjoying it any vested I 2 104 interest or easement, and should not relieve them from, any claim for damage occasioned by them; that they should be required to remove or alter their wires if the premises were about to be raised, or for any other good cause shown; and that the occupier should be able to appeal to the local authority to order the removal of the wire if he could show special circumstances which caused, it to be an injury to him or his property. With regard to attachments, it was explained that wires could not be attached to buildings without the consent of the occupier and owner, and that in certain cases it might be impossible to obtain access to premises for the purpose of connecting them with the generals telephonic system, owing to the refusal of an individual' to allow an attachment. The Committee thought that in special cafes, where it could be proved to the satisfaction of the local authority that certain individuals or certain districts were debarred from telephonic communication owing to such refusal, the local authority should be authorised to give permission for wires to be attached to premises under suitable regulations and on payment of such compensation as the local authority might think just. The Select Committee suggested that bye-laws for the regulation of all wires, as to substance, length of span, durability and other matters, and for their identification and inspection, should be made for the whole of London by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and for other places, by the municipal and other authorities, in each case subject to the sanction of the Board of Trade, and that in London the enforcement of the bye-laws should be entrusted to the City Corporation and to the Vestries and District; Boards. The Committee thought it necessary, for the protection of the public, that there should be 105 ready means of dealing with every wire, and that for this purpose every wire should be identified. The bye-laws, they thought, should provide for the best method of identification, by registration or otherwise, and for the removal of all ownerless wires. These suggestions were not embodied in any Bill, and no doubt will be the basis of future legislation on the subject. WATER SUPPLY. At the date of the last Annual Report presented to the Vestry, Mr. Torrens' Bill, "To disclose that the term, 'annual value,' in the 68th Section of the Waterworks' Clauses Act, 1847 shall mean 'rateable value,'" had passed the House of Commons, and was before the House of Lords. The Vestry took active measures in support of the Bill, and Lord Brabazon presented the following Petition:— To the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in Parliament assembled. The HUMBLE PETITION of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, in the County of Surrey. SHEWETH, THAT a Bill has been brought up from the Honourable House of Commons, and introduced into your Lordships' House, intituled, "A Bill to declare and explain the 68th Section of the Waterworks' Clauses Act, 1847." That your Petitioners' Parish is an extensive one, comprising about 31,000 houses, of the gross value of over a million pounds sterling, and is within the Metropolitan area, as defined by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. The inhabitants are supplied with water by the following Companies:— The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company. The Lambeth Water Company. The Kent Water Company. 106 That by the provisions of the several Acts of Parliament under which these Companies are constituted, they are empowered to charge the occupiers of houses for the water supplied on a rental based upon the "Annual Value," or "Yearly Value" of the said houses. That on an appeal to your Lordships in the case of Dobbs v. The Grand Junction Waterworks Company, your Lordshipsdecided that the "Annual Value" was the annual value as expressed and explained in the Parochial Assessment Act. That your Petitioners believe that in consequence of such judgment of your Lordships the Water Companies would be legally compelled to charge the Ratepayers of your Petitioners' Parish on the Rateable or Annual Value only of their houses, as assessed in the Quinquennial List, made in accordance with the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, and the said Parochial Assessment Act. That the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor are the rating or local authorities of this Parish, and to enable tliem to ascertain the Gross and Rateable Values of the house to be assessed cause the Collectors of the Rates to obtain a return from each Ratepayer of the full particulars of his tenancy, and having viewed the property they are enabled to arrive, with some degree of certainty, at the gross and rateable value of the house, and to assess accordingly, and of such assessment a notice is given to the Ratepayer. If he has any objection the Assessment Committee appoint a day for hearing the objection, and if the Ratepayer is dissatisfied with this determination he is at liberty to appeal to the Assessment Sessions—a tribunal expressly appointed for that purpose. -That the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, and other. Water Companies, notwithstanding the great care and impartiality of the rating authority, ignore their annual value and arbitrously constitute themselves into a rating authority for 107 the Water Rates, and charge on such annual value what they, in their judgment, deem proper. That the power of the Company to charge on their own estimate is harrassing and oppressive to the Ratepayer, and entails expenses and litigation to Parishioners who do not feel inclined to submit to the annual value and charges made by such interested parties. Your Petitioners respectfully submit that it is necessary and important that the said Bill, which will give peace and quiet to the Ratepayers, and prevent the anomaly of two annual values of the same house—should pass into law. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Lordships will be pleased to pass the Bill, and that it may become law. The Bill was passed, and duly received the royal assent. The Parishioners are now, therefore, liable to be charged only on the basis of the rateable value as assessed in the Valuation List. While upon this subject it will be seen, on reference to the Report of last year, that a Committee was appointed to watch over all questions relating to the water supply of the Parish. It was a source of regret to the Vestry that Mr. W. H. Squire, who was the Chairman of the Committee, and who had always taken a most energetic part in its work, should have felt it incumbent upon him to resign his position as a Member of the Vestry. The Vestry to mark their appreciation of his special services, unanimously passed the following resolution:— "That the best thanks of this Vestry be presented to Mr. William Henry Squire for the able and zealous performance of his duties as a Member of the Vestry, and more especially for the valuable and efficient Assistance rendered by him as Chairman of the Special Water Committee appointed by the Vestry to watch over all questions relating to the Water supply of the Parish; and 108 the Vestry desire to express their regret at his resignation, and to hope that, in future, he may be blessed with health, happiness and prosperity." ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE. This year being the Quinquennial year since 1880, it was incumbent upon the Churchwardens and Overseers to make a re-valuation of the whole of the hereditaments of the Parish. They finished their laborious duties, and in due course deposited the revised assessments with the Committee." The Committee presented a Report to the Vestry, and as it gives all the details and particulars which may be interesting to the Parishioners, it is printed in extenso as follows:— REPORT OF THE ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE to the Vestry of Camberwell, THURSDAY, APRIL 1, 1886. THE COMMITTEE have the pleasure of reporting their proceedings during the past Quinquennial Year, 1885. The Overseers of the Poor, in accordance with the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1 869, deposited with your Committee, during the year, four Provisional Lists, containing tli3 following number of Assessments:— March 568 June 756 September 665 December 620 Total number of separate Assessments- 2,609 as against 2,098 in the Quinquennial Year 1880, and 912 in the Quinquennial Year 1875. Two copie3 of each of these Provisional Lists were prepared by the Clerk—one for the Committee, and one for the Surveyor of Taxes. 109 2,GOO Notices were also prepared and sent by him to the Occupiers of Houses in the above Lists. The Committee received, and heard, objections to the Assessments comprised in the several Lists and satisfactorily adjudicated upon them, there being no Appeals from their decisions to the Assessment Sessions. In addition to the above, the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, provides that the Valuation List shall be revised every five years, and last year (1885) being the fifth year, the Churchwardens and Overseers performed this laborious task, and deposited with the Committee the Valuation List of the Parish for 1885, contained in eleven books [twenty-two books in duplicate] comprising the following Assessments:— Collecting District. 1885. 1880. 1875. Ward 1 4,488 3,629 3,263 Ward 2 3,887 3,279 2,578 Ward 3 3,530 3,308 3,125 District 4 3,051 3,004 2,727 District 5 3,753 5,252 2,845 District 4a 2,621 3,285 3,341 District 5a 3,501 Camberwell District 3,760 4,747 2,512 East Dulwich District 5,290 Dulwich District 1,079 1,849 1,247 Public Companies 98 — — 35,058 28,353 21,668 being an increase since 1880 (five years) of 6,705. 110 The Overseers, in accordance with the Statute, caused Notices to be issued to all the Ratepayers that the Committeewould hear the objections of those who felt themselves aggrieved by reason of any unfairness or incorrectness in the Valuation List. Your Committee received Notices of Objections to their Assessments from the following number of Ratepayers:— Quinquennial Year. Number. 875 360 1880 1,100 1885 1,084 Your Committee are glad to report that, having heard the objections, and viewed many of the properties, the final adjudication by them on the respective objections appeared to give satisfaction to the great majority of the Appellants. Your Committee have not been served with one Notice of Appeal to the General Assessment Sessions. Your Committee found that, in the majority of these cases, it was necessary to reduce the Assessments, the rentals of the houses having decreased. The most important and difficult part of your Committee's task was the assessment of the Public Companies. As the Vestry are aware, the mode of rating Gas, Railway, Water, and other Companies ig involved in considerable difficulty. Your Committee, to enable them to make a fair and equitable assessment of the respective properties, and with a view that they should bear their fair share of the contribution towards the expenses. 111 of the Parish, required them to make returns of their respective incomes and expenditure in connection with this Parish. These your Committee investigated, and Messrs. Livesay, the Chairman of the South Metropolitan Gas Company, Mr. Ryde, the Surveyor retained by the Crystal Palace Gas Company, the Engineer and Solicitor to the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, Mr. Vigers, the Surveyor employed by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, and the various Secretaries and representatives of the other Public Companies, attended your Committee, and their objections were fully heard and considered. Your Commitee are glad to report that they were enabled, after considerable discussion, and after having viewed the reservoirs of the Southwark and Yauxhall Water Company at Nunhead, finally to agree with them as to their assessments. With regard to the South Metropolitan Gas Company's important assessment, it was agreed by mutual consent to increase the rateable value of the Company's mains, works, &c., from £18,000 to £24,000, an increase of £6,000. With reference to the School Board, that Board appealed against their assessments, contending that it should be assessed at what the Board Schools would let for, if let to yearly tenants,, and not, as your Committee maintained, upon the cost of building and land, &c. It was represented to your Committee that a special case was pending in the Court of Queen's Bench, the decision of which would settle the dispute. Judgment has since been given against the School Board, and consequently the Committee's assessments have been sustained. Your Committee feel gratified that they have been enabled to dispense with the assistance of skilled Surveyors, which on the occasion of the last Quinquennial List cost upwards of £750, and they have been enabled to settle with all the Companies on a fair and just basis, and so as to avoid the expense of litigation. 112 The Committee submit the following Summary of the QUINQUENNIAL RE-VALUATION, 1885.

Your Committee have now to request a cheque for £50 for printing and other expenses incurred by your Committee. In conclusion, your Committee desire to bear testimony to the zeal, labour, and judgment displayed by the Parish Officers in the preparation of the Valuation List, which is evidenced by 114 the fact of there being only 1,084 objections received out of 35,058 assessments. All of which is submitted. Signed, by order of the Committee, JOHN GRUMMANT, Chairman. GEO. W. MARSDEX, Clerk to the Committee. Mr. Grummant, who had been for very many years unanimously elected Chairman of this Committee—a post he was eminently fitted to fill from his extensive and practical knowledge of the value of property, and from the laborious attention he gave to the duties of the office of Chairman—resigned his position as a member of the Vestry, and consequently ceased to be qualified for the position he had filled for so long a period. His retirement from the Vestry was a great loss to the Parish at large, and the Vestry were pleased to pass a resolution expressing their regret thereat, and to order it to be presented to Mr. Grummant engrossed on vellum. He was succeeded in the Chair by Mr. J. J. Phillips. REGULATION OF FIREWOOD STACKS. The Metropolitan Board of Works having introduced a Bill into the House of Commons for the safe keeping of firewood within the limits of the Metropolis, the Vestry received a deputation of persons employed in the trade, and heard their representations that the Bill would have the effect of curtailing the business of firewood merchants, and of driving the storeyards out of the Metropolis, thus depriving an exceedingly numerous and very poor class of people of their only means of livelihood. The Vestry took into consideration the statements, and came to the conclusion that legislation on the subject was inimical to the interests 115 of the working population of the Parish, and therefore expressed to the Board their opinion that the Bill was unnecessary, and urged upon them to withdraw it. The Board ultimately withdrew the Bill. CANTERBURY ROAD, OLD KENT ROAD. The attention of the Vestry had been, for some time past, directed to the bad condition of Canterbury Road. It is a "new street," and has never been repaired by the Parish. This road is partly in this parish, and partly in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford (which is under the jurisdiction of the Greenwich District Board of Works). The 105th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act directs that the owners of the land abutting the street are liable to contribute the apportioned expenses of paving the road. Unfortunately the Statute only empowers the Vestry to impose a rate in its own Parish, and the decision in the Vestry of Mile End v. Guardians of Whitechapel Union decides that an apportionment, on one side of the road only, is invalid. Consequently, to meet this legal difficulty, and acting under the advice of Counsel, this Vestry and the Greenwich Board of Works, simultaneously passed resolutions, similarly worded, to pave so much of Canterbury Road as was in the two districts, under the 105th Section of the Metropolitan Local Management Act, and each authority, at the same time, made similiar apportionments on the owners on both sides of the road, with the intention of seeking payment from the owners in their own respective parishes. The Vestry of Camberwell met with little, or no difficulty on their side of the road, but one of the owners on the Deptford side refused to pay, and a summons against him was heard before Mr. Balguy, in the 116 Greenwich Police Court. The result was that the Magistrate dismissed the summons, holding the course adopted by the two authorities, to meet the difficulty of the road being in two parishes, was not valid; but the Magistrate offered to the Greenwich Board to state a special case for the Court of Queen's Pencil. The Greenwich Board declined to avail themselves of the suggestion of Mr. Balguy, although strongly advised by Counsel. The Vestry then had no alternative but to apply to the Metropolitan Board of Works for their Order, under the 104th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the 8Gth Section of the Amendment Act, 1862, placing Canterbury Road under the control and management of one of the authorities interested. The Greenwich Board passed a resolution consenting to an order vesting the control and management of the road entirely in the Vestry of Camberwell; the expense of paving, lighting up, making up, &c., to be mutually borne in equal proportions. Under this order a precept was made by the Vestry on the Greenwich Board. This the Board have refused to pay, and legal proceedings have now been taken by the Vestry to enforce payment of their precept. I believe the defence is of a technical character, and only made to enable the Board to pay the amount demanded out of the General Rate, without i ncurring responsibility. I regret that, in consequence of the difficulties created by the Act of Parliament, by the defaulting owner in the Parish of Deptford, and by the course of action which the Greenwich Board have felt it necessary to adopt, Canterbury Road remains, at present, in a neglected condition. 117 CANTERBURY ROAD BRIDGE. For some time past the rapid increase of houses in the vicinity of Canterbury Road, Old Kent Road, not only in this Parish, but in the neighbouring ones of Deptford, Bermondsey, and Rotherhithe, rendered it necessary that the present old swing bridge, erected when the canal was made, should be replaced by one more convenient and suitable to the great increase of traffic. The Vestry therefore empowered the General Purposes Committee to put themselves in communication with the Greenwich District Board respecting the advisability of taking measures to obtain a substantial bridge over the canal at the foot of Canterbury Road. The Committee also put themselves in communication with all the parties in this Parish affected by the formation of the bridge and the approaches, and, after considerable difficulties and much correspondence, were enabled to report to the Vestry, that sufficient contributions had been promised to warrant the Vestry applying to the Metropolitan Board of Works for one-half the cost of this much-needed improvement. The Vestry, in conjunction with the Greenwich District Board, also employed the late Mr. Dredge, C. E., who had been the Engineer of St. George's and other bridges which were erected in this Parish, to furnish designs and plans for the construction of the bridge, with an estimate of the probable cost. The Vestry themselves promised a contribution not exceeding £1,000, and the Greenwich Board will probably contribute a similar amount. The Metropolitan Board, on the active representations of the Vestry's representatives at the Board, have agreed to pay onehalf the expense, and to obtain the necessary Parliamentary powers. The plans and estimates of Mr. Dredge have been deposited with the Metropolitan Board, and there is every K 118 probability of the Board obtaining statutory authority, in the next session of Parliament, to erect the bridge. LONDON GOVERNMENT. During the past year a letter was received from the Vestry of St. Mary, Islington, enclosing a scheme for the future Government of the Metropolis by means of Municipalities, and stating that they were desirious of ascertaining the views of, other local authorities thereon. The Vestry, however, did not consider the time was fitting for a discussion of the subject, as there was not then any probability of its coming before Parliament. SCHOOL BOARD EXPENDITURE. The payment, from time to time of the steadily-increasing Precepts of the School Board, has, as in previous years, again brought the question of the Expenditure of that body under the consideration of the Vestry. The Vestry having received a Precept from the School Board requiring the payment of £32,927 10s. 2d. for the year ending March, 1886 (the Precept for the year ending March, 1887, was £36,347 4s. 2d.), the Vestry, as also many of the rating authorities of the Metropolis, presented a Petition to the House of Commons in the following terms:— House of Commons, Session 1885. To the Honorable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The HUMBLE PETITION of the Vestry of Camberwell, in the County of Surrey, as to the Expenditure of the School Board for London. SHEWETH, THAT your Petitioners are the Bating Authority named in the Elementary Education Act, 1870, and upon whom Preceptsare to he made by the School Board for London. rIhat your Petitioners desire to draw attention to the increasing expenditure of the School Board, which expenditure 119 is now far in excess of any estimate that was ever made as to a Eate for educational purposes under the Act of 1870. That your Petitioners believe that the excessive expenditure arises from an imperfect conception of the Acts of Parliament, and particularly of the Act of 1847, which provided for Privy Council grants for the elementary education of the children of the working classes, whereas the School Board has undertaken the education of children of all clases of school age, and has thereby charged upon the Ratepayers the execution of a duty which was not contemplated when the Elementary Education Act was passed in 1870. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honorable House will be pleased to order an enquiry to be made into the premises either by a Select Committee or by a Royal Commission appointed in compliance with an Address to the Crown from your Honorable House. AND YOUR PETITIONEES WILL EVER PRAY, &C. The Vestry were subsequently invited, by the Vestryof St. James, Westminster, to send three delegates to a Conference to be held on the subject, at the Mansion House, on the 27th of June, and, in compliance with the invitation they appointed Messrs. A. Middlemass, J. Sears, and W. E. Teather. The Members of Parliament for the County and Borough were also asked to attend the Conference. The delegates reported that the folloAving resolutions were passed:— (i) That in the opinion of this Conference the administration of the School Board of London has not produced results commensurate with the vast expenditure of the Board, and that the present cost of maintenance of London Board Schools is excessive, whether compared with the rate of expenditure by the Board in 1873, with the expenditure of other Boards in England and Wales, or with the expenditure of the Managers of Voluntary K 2 120 Schools in London; that in the cost of administration and some other respects the expenditure of the Board will admit of large reductions without impeding the work of popular elementary education in the Metropolis, and that the Board be urged to reduce its expenditure accordingly. (ii) That the various Rating Authorities in the Metropolis he invited to call the attention of the Ratepayers in their several districts, in such manner as they may deem best, to the facts referred to in the foregoing resolution, and to the paramount necessity of securing and supporting at the forthcoming Election of the School Board Candidates of administrative ability, pledged to carry out the provisions of the Elementary Education Acts with a due regard to economy. RELIEF OF THE UNEMPLOYED OF THE METROPOLIS. On the 17th of February last the Vestry received a communication from the Local Government Board stating that that Board had under their consideration representations which had been made to them with regard to the special distress alleged to exist, at that time, throughout the Metropolis. The Board desired to be informed of the views of the Vestry as to the extent of the distress in the Parish, and as to how far it is exceptional. If exceptional, the Board asked to be informed as to the classes and workpeople among whom the destitution is most marked, and as to the probability of its continuance, and they also suggested that any works the Vestry were contemplating should be commenced. The Board, further, asked to be furnished with a list of any closed Graveyards in the Parish, which, in the opinion of the Vestry, might, with advantage be levelled and made into Recreation Grounds. 121 This important communication the Vestry referred to the joint consideration of the three standing Committees, and, at the same time, decided to inform the Board that, in the opinion of the Vestry, St. Giles and St. George's Church_ yards, and the Burial Ground at Dulwich might, with advantage, be immediately levelled and made into Recreation Grounds. I may as well state here, that, in accordance with the latter part of this resolution, communications were immediately opened with the Rev. F. F. Kelly, the Vicar of Camberwell the Rev. Norman Campbell, Incumbent of St. George's, and the Estates Governors of Dulwich College, the parties interested in the disused Burial Ground at Dulwich. It was found to be impracticable to deal with the Churchyard of St. Giles; and the Estates Governors, in reply to the communication referred to, refused their consent to the laying out of the Dulwich Burial Ground, but with reference to the St. George's Burial Ground, the Vestry were met with the cordial assistance of the Vicar, and, in all probability, the Parishioners in the poor district around St. George's Church will have the advantages of an open space laid out with shrubberies and flower beds, for the resort of themselves and their children. The steps taken to obtain the necessary Faculty are detailed under the heading, "St. George's Burial Ground." The Vestry also placed the use of their Committee rooms at the disposal of the Mansion House Fund Local Committee, and many of the members of the Vestry were placed upon the Committee, and its Sub-committces, and actively assisted in relieving the prevailing distress. In order that the three standing Committees should be in possession of the fullest information on the subject, I ascertained the views of all those in the Parish under whose 122 notice the distress existing would be likely to be brought, and the following report contained a brief summary of the varied opinions obtained:— The Vestry, on the 17th inst., had submitted to them letters from the Local Government Board, and the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, with reference to the special distress whicn is alleged to exist at the present time in the Metropolis. With reference to the portion of the Board's letter referring to the disused Burial Grounds or Churchyards of the Parish, the Vesitry found no difficulty in arriving at the decision to recommend St. Giles' Churchyard, St. George's Churchyard, and the Burial Ground at Dulwich as, in their opinion, spaces which could, with advantage, be levelled and laid out as Recreation Grounds. In accordance with this resolution I have been in communicacation with the Local Government Board, and with the Chairman (Lord Brabazon) and the Secretary to the Public Gardens Association, and have pointed out to the latter that, in my opinion, in the case of each Churchyard or Burial Ground referred to by the Vestry, a faculty would be required before any steps could be taken to give work upon them to the "unemployed." The obtaining of these faculties would take, at least, two months, and would further, depend upon the sanction of the incumbents, or others interested. In view of these difficulties, and having regard also to the fact that even when successful, occupation would be found only for a short period, I cannot think that this must be looked to as a means of affording any material relief in the present special distress. With regard to the main difficulty of the reference of the Vestry, viz., the answers to the questions of the Local Government Board, I have endeavoured to obtain such information as I thought might assist the Committee in their deliberations. With this view I forwarded a letter to the Medical Officers of the Parish, the Relieving Officers, Sanitary Inspectors, Head Masters of Board, Ragged, National and Sunday Schools, Inspectors 123 of Police, Collectors of Rates and Taxes, Secretaries of Savings Banks, and many others, asking their views on the subject. I regret that in many cases, my correspondents have contented themselves with merely forwarding lists of cases in their opinion deserving of relief, but I submit to the Committee the fact that in reply to my letters some hundreds of persons have been recommended as in urgent need of assistance. I am inclined to assume from this alone, that the distress in this Parish must be exceptional, and very serious. The divergence of opinion on this point is very noticeable; but I attribute this to the fact that the really deserving poor of this Parish are not of the very lowest classes, and are loath to obtrude their poverty on the notice of the general observer, and still more unwilling to apply to the Guardians for relief. But I gather, from the replies to my letters, that the distress in this Parish is greater than it has been for some years past. I would quote, 011 this point, the reply of Father Hynn, whose knowledge of the poor in the very poor neighbourhood of Pitman Street entitles him to speak with authority, and who says that "the distress is much deeper and more widely spread than it has been for several years." General Merriman, the Chairman of the Camberwell Committee of the Mansion House Fund, also states from his experience in connection with that Committee, that there exists in Camberwell "a considerable amount of abnormal distress among 'out-of-work cases.' " As to the classes and occupations of the persons affected, I find that those connected with the building trade are the chief sufferers, the building operations in this suburb having been, during recent years, more extensive than those of any other suburb of the Metropolis, except, perhaps, Wandsworth. To a less extent all the mechanic class are sufferers, and there is no doubt, also, that our Parish contains many clerks and small tradesmen who are rendered destitute by the prevailing general depression in trade. 124 The question of how long this condition of things may be expected to continue appears to me to be inseparably connected "with the causes which have produced it. These seem to me, so far as our Parish is concerned, to be as follow:— The stagnation in the building trade, caused by the over building at East Dulwich and elsewhere. The increasing practice of importing finished goods, which were hitherto hand-made by carpenters, joiners, and mechanics generally. The unusual severity of the past winter. The general depression in trade. Looking at these causes it appears to me that the present distress may be slightly decreased with better weather, but will, in all probability, continue for a long period to come. GEORGE W. MARSDEN, Vestry Clerk. On the 3rd of March, 1886, the Joint Committees reported to the Vestry that they had very carefully considered the reference to them, and recommended that, with referenceto the questions of the Local Government Board, the Board be informed that, in the opinion of the Vestry, there is, in this Parish, at the present time, great and exceptional distress, especially among mechanics, clerks, unskilled workers, and others who are not accustomed, even in the time of pressure, to apply for assistance to the Poor Law Guardians, and that the Board he further informed that the Vestry will take every step towards expediting the early commencement of such works in the Parish as may he expedient to be carried out, so that occupation may be found, to as great an extent as possible, for the unemployed of this district. The Vestry adopted the recommendation, and it was duly communicated to the Board. 125 MORTUARY. On the 22nd of July, 1881, a faculty was granted for the erection of a Mortuary 011 a portion of the disused Burial Ground of St. George's Church. The Committee accordingly obtained authority from the Vestry to have plans and estimates prepared by the Surveyor for the building of the Mortuary, and these having been considered by the Committee, advertisements inviting sealed tenders to be sent in, were inserted in The Times, The Builder, and the local papers. In response thereto tenders were received from several contractors, and the Vestry accepted that of Mr. Holloway, his prices being as follows:— Erection of Mortuary Building £684 11 5 Special Foundation (necessitated through a churchyard being chosen as the site) 97 10 6 Entrance Gate 10 12 4 £792 14 3 On the 13th of January, 1886, the Special Mortuary Committee—through their Chairman, Mr. G. C. Whiteley— submitted the following report:— Your Committee beg leave to refer to the Report presented by your Committee to the Vestry, in which it is stated that your Committee had accepted the tender of Mr. H. L. Holloway, Builder, Queen's Road, New Cross, for the erection of the Mortuary, in accordance with the design approved of by the Vestry, for the sum of £792 143. 3d., and your Committee have the gratification of reporting that the erection of the Mortuary— consisting of two rooms for infectious and non-infectious cases, and post-mortem and Waiting Room—is now completed. 126 Your Committee have also furnished the Mortuary with seats and other necessary accommodation, and have provided fittings specially needed for post-mortem examination of bodies. Your Committee have prepared forms for the Rules and Regulations of the Mortuary; for the Register Book to be kept at the Mortuary; the orders to receive the Body (books of which will be kept at the Vestry Clerk and Medical Officer's Departments, the Guardians' Offices, and the District Police Stations); and for the indexed Guard Book for filing such orders. Your Committee consider it necessary that a Mortuary Keeper should be appointed to have the care of the building, and to be entrusted with the carrying out of the foregoing rules and regulations. T. Windley, who has been for many years the Verger of St. George's Church, Camberwell, and resides opposite to the entrance of the Mortuary, and who, in the opinion of your Committee, possesses suitable qualifications for the office, has been temporarily appointed by your Committee, and they recommend that he be permanently appointed at a salary of 15s. per week. Your Committee invite the inspection of the building by the Vestry, and they believe its architectural design, and the details of its carrying out, will merit their approval. Your Committee, in conclusion, have now to report that the Mortuary was formally opened on Tuesday, January 5th, 1886, by the Rev. A. Fisher, who officiated in the absence of the Rev. S. Smith, M.A., late Vicar of St. George's, who was prevented by illness from attending. Your Committee regret his absence on such an occasion, as they feel that acknowledgement is due to him for his great kindness and assistance in enabling the Vestry to succesfully carry out the undertaking on its present site. All of which is submitted. G. C. WHITELEY, Chairman. 127 This Report was adopted and practically completed the work which the Mortuary Committee were appointed, by the Vestry, to carry out. It only now remains for them to endeavour to make arrangements for the holding of Inquests at the Mortuary, so that it can be utilised to its fullest extent, and the objectionable practice of holding these enquiries at public houses avoided. With this view the Committee have, in the application for the Faculty for laying out the St. George's Burial Ground, applied for the authority of the Bishop of the Diocese to hold the Coroner's Court in the Mortuary. The application has been lodged with the Dioscesan Registrar, and I fully anticipate that it will be acceded to. ST. GEORGE S BURIAL GROUND, On the 17th of February, 1886, the Vestry having decided that St. George's Burial Ground might, with advantage, be levelled and laid out as a Recreation Ground, the Rev. Norman Campbell, who succeeded the Rev. S. Smith in the incumbency of the Church, was communicated with as to his views on the subject. Subjcct to the reservation of the right hereafter to erect a chancel to the Church, and with certain minor conditions, Mr. Campbell at once gave his consent, and has since assisted the Vestry in every possible way in the carrying out of the desirable object of obtaining an open space for the Ratepayers in this crowded district. Application was then made to Lord Brabazon, the President of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, as to how far that Society would assist the Vestry. The Society, with great liberality, undertook to lay out the ground as a public garden, to provide hard core and gravel for the walks, to provide also trees and shrubs, turf, drainage, water supply 128 and stand pipes, mowing machine, and all tools for keeping the garden in order. The estimated cost of this work to the Society is £190. Loud Brabazon's Association also furnished through their Honorary Surveyors, Miss F. R. Wilkinson and Mr. W.Woodward, plans for the laying out of the Burial Ground, and of the present position of all the graves, together with a schedule of the legible names on the tombstones. The estimates and plans have been deposited with the Diocesan Registrar of Rochester, annexed to the following petition for a faculty:— To the Right Reverend Father in God, Anthony Wilson, by Divine permission Lord Bishop of Rochester. The HUMBLE PETITION of the Rector and Churchwardens of the Parish of St. George, Camberwell, in the County of Surrey, and the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell, in the said County, and your Lordship's Diocese. SHEWETH, THAT the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, is a very extensive Parish and has now a population of 200,000 persons, and is divided into 16 ecclesiastical districts or ecclesiastical parishes, and among them is the said Parish of St. George, which is densely populated and has no open space, recreation ground, or ornamental garden for the use of the public. That the Churchyard of the said Parish Church of St. George has been closed for all purposes of burial by order of her Majesty's Privy Council for the last thirty years, and is now a disused burial ground which needs great alteration and improvement. As there are not any funds to maintain it in good order and condition, it is in a neglected and delapidated state. It possesses few, if any monuments, and the tombstones are in a bad state, and are in many cases falling to the ground, and requiring the attention of your Petitioners. 129 This crowded district being ill-provided with grounds for public use, the laying out of this Churchyard under proper byelaws, regulations and supervision, will be a great boon to the inhabitants. That your Lordship was pleased to grant a faculty sanctioning the erection of a Mortuary in part of the Churchyard, which Mortuary has now been built and is of much use to the Parish, and the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell, learn from the Coroner that its utility would be greatly enhanced by allowing the use of one of the rooms of the Mortuary to hold ordinary Inquests. The "Vestry find that there is a room sufficiently large, and can be used for that purpose, and thus prevent the scandal of Inquests being held in public houses, which is considered offensive to all parties compelled to attend the Inquests, and it is respectfully submitted that the use of the Mortuary may be further extended by allowing the said Inquests to be held there. That the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association are prepared to bear the expense of laying out a portion of the Churchyard and maintaining it in good order and condition ; such laying out will consist of the removal of such tombstones as may be necessary to carry out the work, and the formation of paths and flower beds and the planting of shrubs and trees. That your Petitioners, in conjunction with any other person whose sanction or consent may be found necessary, desire that the said Churchyard may be conveyed to the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, in order that the said Vestry, when the improvements above mentioned have been carried out, may thereafter maintain the Churchyard in a proper state and condition. That your Petitioners will submit a plan of the Churchyard and desire a faculty for the purpose, excepting so much ag may be required by the present incumbent of the said Parish, or his successors, for the ultimate erection of a new Chancel and Vestries to the said Church. 130 Your Lordship's Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Lordship will be pleased to decree a faculty for the purposes: aforesaid. AND YOUR PETITIONERS WILL EVER PRAY, &C. It will be seen that the application to hold inquests iu the Parish Mortuary has been incorporated in the petition for this faculty for the laying out of the Burial Ground as a place of resort. The thanks of the Vestry are due, in this matter, to the Rev. Norman Campbell, who has assisted by every means in his power, to the Metropolitan Public Gardens' Association, and to the Chairman and Members of the Mortuary Committee, who have given careful consideration to all the steps necessary to be taken to successfully carry through the resolution of the Vestry of the 17th of February. PERSONAL. The Vestry have to record the death, during the past year, of Mr. John Simmonds, who was one of the representatives in the Vestry of Ward No. 6. Though not at the time of his death a Member of the Vestry, he had, while taking part in its debates, exhibited such marked zeal and ability that the intelligence of his early death was received with sincere regret. I also take this opportunity of recording that Mr. Andrew Middlemass was stricken down with a serious and alarming illness, but, happily, was restored to health and enabled once more to take his seat in the Vestry. His return to his active and responsible duties was a source of the sincerest gratification to his colleagues, and the Vestry unanimously passed the following resolution thereon:- 131 "That this Vestry desire to express their sincere pleasure at the return of their esteemed colleague, Mr. A. Middlemass, to his parochial duties after his severe illness, and earnestly trust that he may be spared for many years to assist his fellow ratepayers in their deliberations." Though not strictly within the scope of this report I add with pleasure that the Members of the Vestry, and friends, in recognition of the valued public services of Mr. Middlemass, and of their high personal regard for him, took the opportunity of marking his restoration to health by presenting him with an Address engraved on vellum, accompanied by a testimonial in the form of a purse of one hundred sovereigns. In conclusion, it is my painful duty to chronicle, with sorrow, the death on the 15th of October last, of Mr. A. G. Morris, who occupied the position of first Clerk in the Surveyor's Department. The intelligence that his long and severe illness terminated in death was received by the Vestry with sincere regret, and by unanimous resolution they expressed their sympathy with his Avidow and father on their heavy bereavement, and their high appreciation of Mr. Morris's long and faithful services. 133 REPORT OF THE BURIAL BOARD, For the year ending March 25th, 1886. THE BOARD in presenting their Accounts to the Vestry desire for their information to report that the Interments still continue to greatly increase, and the Revenue to advance in like proportion. In the year 1877 the Interments were 2,250, Revenue £2,843 16s. 8d. In the year 1883-4 the Interments were 3,998, Revenue £3,754 8s. 6d. In the year 1881-5 the Interments were 4,061, Revenue £4,420 6s. 6d. In the year 1885-6 the Interments were 4,335, Revenue £4,742 9s. 10d. It will be observed that there has been during the last year an increase of nearly 300 Interments over the previous twelvemonth. The Cash on the Current Account at the Bankers amounts to £239 10s. 10d., and on Deposit, £3,000. The large number of Private Graves disposed of during the year, and the work of apportioning the sum received between the Board, the Incumbents of the sixteen Ecclesiastical L 134 Districts, the Dissenting and Roman Catholic Ministers, and the Churchwardens of Saint Giles' and St. George's, render the work of the Board, and the clerical duties connected therewith, of a very complicated and difficult nature. The Board have during the year held Eleven Meetings, at which the following Members have attended as under— Mr. Lyon 11 Mr. Lassam 11 Mr. Woollard 11 Mr. Wesson 10 Mr Colegrave 9 Mr. Turney 9 Mr. Gudgeon 7 Mr. Strong 4 Mr. Whiteley 4 On the last visit of the Board to the Cemetery they made a very careful and minute inspection of the Chapels and Lodge, and the Fences surrounding the same, and were of the opinion, from the general appearances thereof, that considerable repairs and re-instatements were necessary thereto. The Board thereupon directed the Surveyor of the Cemetery, Mr. Berriman, to report fully on the subject. This he has done, and the Report will be fully considered at the next Meeting of the Board. From the Report it is seen that very considerable repairs are urgently needed in order to sustain the Chapels, Lodge, Buildings, and Fences in an efficient state, and your Board are of opinion that it will be advisable to erect a Brick Wall on the Northern and Eastern side, where houses have been erected abutting the Cemetery. 135 The principal cause of the large amount of Repair now required arises from the Ragstone used in the construction of the several Buildings having been of very inferior quality. The Report deals fully with all the matters now requiring attention. The retiring Members arc Mr. Lyon, Mr. Turney, and Mr. Gudgeon, who are all eligible for re-election. All which is submitted. J. A. LYON, Chairman. T, 2 1885-86. Report of the finance Committee. 139 REPORT of the FINANCE COMMITTEE as to the State of the Finance, &c., of the Parish. Table 1-PARISH OF CAMBERWELL, SURREY.

And we wish to take this opportunity of expressing our satisfaction with the admirable and comprehensive system of keeping these Accounts, the accuracy of which is quite remarkable. In our opinion great credit is due to the Staff of Clerks who have had the management of the books, and we desire particularly to mention Mr. Rees, Mr. Lord and Mr. Pitfield; to the two latter gentlemen we hereby tender our thanks for their valuable assistance in the audit of these Aecounts, which otherwise would have been a most arduous task. We must really call the attention of the Vestry to the enormous accumulation of arrears of Rates; and would suggest that a special Collector of Arrears be appointed at a fixed 182 salary. We also observe that large amounts are paid by the Burial Board as fees to a number of Clergymen who take no part in the Burial Services. Signed— Robert Cousins, Chairman John Cochrane, Auditors.
