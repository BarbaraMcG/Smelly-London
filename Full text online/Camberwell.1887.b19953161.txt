Camberwell Road, east side, extending northward from near Green's row. As per last year's Report, the Vestry had plans prepared by your Surveyor for widening this important thoroughfare in completion of the work already executed by the Metropolitan Board, and petitioned the Board to carry out the same, but your Committee regret to report the reply that the Board were not prepared to act upon the suggestions of the Vestry. Queen's Road, from near Meeting-house-lane to Montpelier road. This much needed improvement also shared the same fate as Camberwell road, the Metropolitan Board not complying with the petition of the Vestry. Goldsmith Road, north side, from Furley street to Marmont road. A small widening of this thoroughfare has been effected here and the footway paved and kerbed by the Owners. Forest Hill Road, east side, from opposite Dunstans road to Mundania road. The freeholders—Messrs. Stevens— of the estate fronting the road at this part, having offered to give up a large strip of land for the purpose of widening the same, on condition that the Vestry made up and paved the 8 footway and road. This offer was accepted by the Vestry upon such conditions—the land to be dedicated to the public for ever. FOOTPATH OR HIGHWAY DIVERSIONS. Your Committee having had submitted to them an application of the Estates Governors of Alleyn's College, Dulwich, proposing that a certain highway or footpath situate at Dulwich, between Turney road and Gallery road, might be stopped up or diverted, and to substitute in lieu thereof a new road named Burbage road, of a more commodious character. The Committee, with your Surveyor,, viewed the highway or footpath and the road, and finding that the new highway or road was slightly longer but very much wider, they recommended the Vestry to comply with the application and to instruct the Vestry Clerk to apply to two Justices of the Peace to view the same, to which the Vestry (as Surveyors of Highways) agreed. The Magistrates duly viewed the locus in quo, and consented to the proposed diversion or substitution at a Court held at the Surrey Sessions, on 24th October last. YORK STONE PAVING & GRANITE PITCHING. General Works. The General Repairs of the footways and crossings throughout the Parish, including making 9 good openings made for gas and water and drainage trenches, have been executed by the masons and paviors, in the employ of the Vestry, the material being supplied by contract to the Vestry. The work incidental to trenches is charged to the respective Companies. Special Repairs have also been executed at:— Camberwell Road, west side, from Wyndham road to Avenue road. Camberwell Grove, east side, from Church street to Lettsom street. Wells Street, west side, from the Canal Bridge to Harling street. Waterloo Street, from Camberwell green to George street. The approximate quantity of New Material used during the year was as follows: York Paving 31,069 feet sup. Kerb 638 „ run. Granite Pitching 580 yds. sup. The above quantity of Granite Pitching includes numerous crossings placed in the footways at entrances to private premises, which are laid down with the consent of the Vestry at the expense of the various applicants. 10 TAR PAVING.

This Bill—an epitome of which was embodied with Annual Report of last year—having passed both Houses 11 of Parliament, became law. One of the Clauses altered the name of the Company to the "London, Camberwell and Dulwich Tramways" Company, under which new name a further parliamentary depositation was made in November last, the digest of which, and other parliamentary schemes is as follows:— SESSION 1888. "LONDON, CAMBERWELL AND DULWICH TRAMWAYS." Joseph Quick & Sons, Engineers. 23, Gt. George Street, Westminster. William Bell, Parliamentary Agent, 27, Gt. George Street, Westminster. This is a proposed line of Tramway to be laid in continuation of, and connected with, the present Tramway at Peckham Eye, at the junction of East Dulwich Road; passing from thence along the west side of Peckham Rye to Forest Hill Road, and continuing southward to the Forest Hill Tavern, opposite Mundania Road. The inclinations of this Tramway are as follows:— For 5 Chains (about) 1 in 150 6 „ „ 1 in 63 13½ „ 1 in 100 12 „ 1 in 44 12 For 2 Chains (about) 1 in 61 6 „ „ 1 in 542 9 „ „ 1 in 78 5 „ „ 1 in 42 7 „ „ 1 in 29 65½ chains=7/8 mile nearly. Loops or crossings are to be placed nearly opposite to— Barry road Friern road Mundania road At these crossings the spaces between the kerb and T ramway will be less than the statutory width of 9 ft. 6 in. The widths of the public roadways which this line will traverse are as follows:— Peckham Rye. Common Path. Roadway. Footpath next House Property. Ft. In. Ft. In. n. West side, opposite the South corner of East Dulwich road 6-4 30-10 8 - 1 Do. opposite Barry road 6-0 30-0 8-0 Do. opposite Friern road 6-7 27-7 10-0 Forest Hill Road. Opposite the S.E. corner of the Elms 6-5 23 8 10-0 13  Ft. In. Ft. In. Ft. In. Opposite Dunstans road 7-10 26-7 7-4 Do. (unwidened portion) near Mundania road 7-7 20-6 8-0 Do. at loop near Mundania road (widened portion) 9-7 31-9 8-0 Mem.—Between the Kings Arm's P.H. and Friern road, the proposed Tramways occupying the centre of the road will interfere with the course of the new Sewers which may shortly be required to be laid down therein. "ADDITIONAL LANDS FOR WIDENING RYE LANE." Powers are sought in this Bill to acquire part of the forecourts of the following properties:— No. *118, Rye lane, corner of Choumert road. Nos. *128, *128a, *130, *130a, Rye lane. (Mr. W. L. Dowton and others, owners, &c.) This is the paved open space fronting the entrance to Peckham Public Hall, and shops adjoining northward of Coombe Lodge. Nos. 134 and 136, Rye lane (Mr. G. T. Congreve, owner). Forecourts of two houses adjoining southward to Coombe Lodge. Mem.—The above properties marked (*), as also Coombe Lodge, were dealt with in the Act of August last. (See Clause 7.) Clause 5 of the Act of 1885, relating to the Junction between this proposed Tramway and the London Tramway Company's lines at end of Rye lane, in Peckham High street, and also as to the proposed widening of Rye lane, it is proposed 14 "to alter, or repeal, or make other provisions in regard to the same." Mem.—Should these works be permitted it will be necessary to anticipate the paving of the margins of the roadway on each side of the Tramway. As regards the widening of Rye lane, the Vestry passed the following Resolutions on the 15th of February last: (a) That upon the London, Camberwell and and Dulwich Tramway Company widening Rye lane, in a manner shewn upon the plan marked A and deposited by them with this Vestry, and upon such Company acquiring and conveying to the Vestry, free of expense, for the use of the public for ever the land in such plan coloured red, the Tramway No. 1, referred to in the 48 & 49 Vict. c. 199, Section 5, may be constructed. And that after such conveyance the Common Seal of the Vestry be affixed to this resolution as shewing that this Vestry is satisfied with such widening. (b) That upon the London, Camberwell and Dulwicli Tramway Company effecting the Junction of their Tramway No. 1, with the Tramways of the London Tramways Company, Limited (so far as shewn on the plan deposited by them with this Vestry and marked B) in pursuance of the said Section 5 of 48 and 49 Vict. c. 199, and dealt with by the 50 and 51 Vict. cap. 183, Section 15, the Common Seal of the Vestry be affixed to this resolution as shewing that the Vestry is satisfied with such Junction and approves of it, and the said Tramway No. 1 may thereupon be opened for traffic. 15 That the consent of the Vestry be, and is hereby given to the making of the Tramway towards Forest hill, as described in the Bill of the London, Camberwell and Dulwich Tramways' Company, at present before Parliament, and to the maintenance and use of the Tramway already constructed from Queen's road Station to Bye lane, as proposed by Clause 25 of the said Bill. TRAMWAYS. With respect to those Tramway lines which were reported last year as being certified ready for public traffic they remain unopened and unused, being more or less dependent upon the additional powers sought for in the present Session of Parliament. CANTERBURY ROAD BRIDGE. The Bill authorizing the construction of this Bridge, which was contained in the Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) Bill, 1887, having passed through Parliament, the Metropolitan Board communicated to this Vestry on the 11th October last, that they had resolved to proceed with the work upon the following conditions:— "That the Landowners give up the Land required for the Bridge and approaches; that the Local Authorities, and the Landowners contribute £6,000, and that an agreement be entered into for carrying out the arrangement." 16 Thereupon your Committee arranged for, and held joint meetings with the representatives of the Greenwich Board of Works, and the Vestry on the 9th November last, agreed to and adopted the resolutions of your Committee, which were to the following effect:—To agree with the Greenwich Board of Works to make up a moiety not exceeding £6,000 of the actual cost of the Bridge, and to amplify the powers of the joint Committee to enable them to urge upon the Metropolitan Board their views as to the construction of the Bridge. Your Committee subsequently held a conference as to the contribution to be paid by the Greenwich District Board, this Vestry, and the Landowners, who, according to the Agreement prepared by the Metropolitan Board were to pay £6,000. At this meeting it was decided to apply to the Metropolitan Board to reduce the sum of £6,000; which the Board eventually decided to reduce to £5,500 as the fixed sum to be contributed by the District Board, this Vestry, and the Landowners; this the Vestry have agreed to, and authorised the settlement of the Draft Agreement on that basis, and that the Seal of the Vestry be affixed to the same when settled and agreed to by the Greenwich Board.

REPORT OF THE NEW PLANT & SCAVENGING COMMITTEE For the year ending Lady-day, 1888. 61 New Plant & Scavenging Committee. The Vestry having referred the question of the redistribution of the work now carried out by the respective Standing Committees to a Special Committee for report, such report was submitted to the Vestry on the 28th April last, when an additional Committee was formed to deal with all matters relating to Scavenging, Watering, Removal of Dust, the management and control of the Men, Horses, Stables, Shoots, Barges, Carts, Plant and Machinery connected therewith, also the purchase of Horses, Fodder, Tools and Materials required, to be called the Plant and Scavenging Committee, who now report as follows:— ROAD WATERING.

REPORT OF THE Sewers Sanitary Committee For the year ending Lady-day, 1888. 69 The Sewers and Sanitary Committee Submit a Report of the works carried out in their department during the year ending Lady-day, 1888:— NEW SEWERS. The following extensions of Pipe Sewers have been executed by the Vestry as public work. Pipe Sewers. 9-in. 12-in 18-in. Feet. Feet. Feet. Garden street, Mawbey road 130 ... ...

Plans and Sections having been deposited by the Owners with the Vestry for the following proposed Sewers, the same were approved and submitted by the Vestry to the Metropolitan Board of Works for their sanction as required by the statute. The Plans in each case received such sanction, and were executed, the work being supervised by the officers of the Vestry. Pipe Sewers. 12-in. 18-in. Feet. Feet. McDowall road, Knatchbull road 330 ... Loncroft road, Coburg road 180 ... Collyton road, Forest Hill road ... 1,750 510 1,750 NEW GULLIES. 30 Gullies for road drainage are in course of construction in connection with the foregoing works, and extra gullies and alterations to present gullies where required, have also been executed to complete the surface drainage in "New Streets" works. With regard to trapping gullies, the Vestry passed the following resolution on the 28th March, 1888:—That in future, in lieu of continuing to use galvanized shackle flaps, all gullies be syphon trapped, and when any flap-trapped gullies required repair, they be replaced by syphon-trapped gullies. 71 GULLY CLEANSING. The cleansing of the gullies throughout the Parish have received the necessary attention. The number of cart-loads of slop removed from the same during the year being 3,756. SEWER CLEANSING. The Local Main Sewers are attended to and kept free from deposit by the flushers in the employ of the Vestry. The quantity of slop removed from the local sewers during the past year has been 396 cart loads. The casting and cleansing of the Local Main Sewer in the Coburg road, necessitated special attention by reason of the quantity of heavy deposit accumulated therein, resulting from the peculiarly slack gradient of the sewer. This was executed at nightime, with the co-operation of the Metropolitan Board of Works, by shutting down the pen-stocks in the Main Metropolitan Sewers. This work required great caution and vigilance, it being tide work, in order to ensure the safety of the men employed. A portion of the Brick Sewer in Dulwich Common road having been reported to your Committee, by your Surveyor, to be in a somewhat dilapidated condition, by shewing vents in the brickwork, your Surveyor caused special examination to be made of the work, which would appear was caused by a movement of the subsoil, not easily accounted for, but which probably was occasioned by influences to which clay soils are peculiarly subject. The open joints of the brickwork were pointed up to the extent of about 180 ft. in length, the work at the time of compiling this 72 Report is temporarily suspended owing to the wet season, but it will be resumed when circumstances, with better weather, will permit, it is however satisfactory to state that as far as the repairs have gone at present, they do not present any further special cause for apprehensi n. All other local main sewers vested in the Vestry are in thorough repair and working efficiently. HOUSE DRAINAGE. 196 applications have been received for the drainage of 501 houses into the sewers, and the works in connection therewith have been carried out under inspection. DISINFECTING. Your Committee being engaged, assisted by their Sanitary Inspectors, in aiding the public to disinfect sick rooms, also the clothing, bedding, &c., in cases of infectious diseases, it was considered expedient to provide a specially suitable van to reconvey, after disinfecting, the articles previously removed from the infected houses. This van has been provided, is now in use, and is giving much satisfaction. 73 PUBLIC URINALS. 1. Addington square, next High road. 2. Caspian street, New Church road. 3. Denmark hill, opposite berwell green. 4. Havil street, rear . of Vestry Hall. 5. Hanover street, next Rye lane. 6. Hill street, opposite Bush road. 7. Joiners' Arms yard, Denmark hill. 8.

Gentlemen, Judged of by the death-rate alone, the health of London during the year 1887 was better than it has ever been since authentic sanitary records have been made. In my last annual report I pointed out that the death-rates of the last four years had been lower than at any previous time. That of 1887 was an improvement even on this. The deathrates of 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886 and 1887 were severally 205, 20.4, 19.8, 19.9, and 19.6 per 1,000. At the same time, it is right that I should explain, as I explained last year, that the marriage and birth rates have all been unusually low, the marriage-rate for 1887 having been the lowest yet recorded, and the birth-rate the lowest since 1849 . that the relative deficiency in infantile population necessitates a relative falling off in the mortality; and that consequently 80 the lowness of death-rate which has lately prevailed cannot be wholly attributed to improvement in health. And, indeed, although the zymotic death-rate has not been high (has been considerably lower, in fact, than the average for the previous 10 years), neariy all such diseases were more fatal in 1887 than in 1886. Thus, while in 1887 there were only 9 deaths from Small pox and 672 from Fevers, as against 24 and 701 deaths from these diseases respectively in 1886, Hooping-cough increased in mortality from 2,834 to 2,928, Measles from 2,078 to 2894, Diphtheria from 846 to 961, and Scarlet Fever from 688 to 1,447. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the year was really an unusually healthy year. The populations of London and its five groups of districts, as determined at the Census of 1881, were as follows:— Table I.—Populations of London and of its Groups of Districts at Census of 1881. London West D. North D. Central D. East D. South D. 3,816,483 669,633 905,947 282,238 692,738 1,265,927 The numbers have progressively increased since that period, and according to the estimate of the Registrar-General the population of the Metropolis amounted in the middle of 1887 to 4,215,182 persons, of whom 1,985,270 were males, 2,229,922 females. The estimated increase, therefore, in the course of six years, was no less than 398,709. 81 In Table II. I have given the number of births and deaths occurring in the whole of London and in each of its groups of districts, together with the corresponding birthrates and death-rates:— Table II.—Births, Deaths, Birth-rates and Death-rates of London and its Groups of Districts for 1887. London West D. North D. Central D. East D. South D.

It is slightly lower than it was in the previous year. The death-rate of the Southern group is lower than those of all the other groups, excepting only the Northern. It is lower by 0.5 than its own mortuary rate for 1886. Table III. records the deaths from the more important zymotic or infectious dieseases in London, year by year, for the last ten years; and, for the year 1887, their distribution among the several groups of districts:— 82 Table III.—Mortality op chief Zymotic Diseases in London for 10 years.

In the subjoined table (Table IV.) are given the populations of Camberwell aud of its sub-districts as they were determined at the census of 1881, and the populations estimated for the middle of the year 1887, on the assumption 83 that the rates of increase of each sub-district and of the Parish, which prevailed between 1871 and 1881, have been maintained since:— Table IV.—Populations op Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham St. George's Parish. As estimated at Census of 1881. 5,590 59,104 71,089 50,810 186,593 As estimated for middle of year 1887. 6,842 88,050 98,563 65,497 257,810 It will be found that the total for the Parish in the last line does not correspond exactly with the totals obtained by adding up the estimates for the several sub-districts. The difference, which is not very important, depends on the fact (which renders absolute agreement impossible) that the increase for each sub-district, as also that for the entire Parish, have been calculated on independent data. It is almost needless, perhaps, to say that the assumed rates of increase are never really maintained; that the estimated annual growth of the Parish is much more likely to prove fairly uniform than that of any one of its constituent parts; and that hence as we recede further and further from the last census the estimates of the parochial population, and especially the estimates of the populations of the several sub-districts, probably differ more and more widely from the populations actually existing. During the year 1887 (see Table V.) 7,449 children, of •whom 3,869 were boys and 3,580 were girls, were born in the Parish. Of these, 107 belonged to Dulwich, 2,363 to Camberwell, 2,705 to Peckham, and 2,274 to St. George's. 84 The births were more numerous by 146 than they were in 1886. In Dulwich there was an increase of 23, in Peckham of 119, and in St George's of 94, while in Camberwell there was a falling off of 90. Table V.—Births in Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich.

I made the following remarks in my last report:—" It will be observed that there has been a general and considerable diminution of the birth-rate for 1886 as compared with that for 1885. The birth-rate of Dulwich was, as it always has been, very low, and that of Peckham has fallen so much that it adds probability to what other circumstances suggest, namely, that the population of this sub-district has not been increasing at its former rate, and that it is now considerably less than the estimate." This fall in the death-rate has, on the whole, continued; for, as will be seen, the death-rate has fallen in Camberwell, in Peckham, and in the whole Parish. It has remained stationary in St. George's, and only in Dulwich has risen. Table VI.—Birth-Rates of Camberwell and its Sub- Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's Parish. 1886 12.7 29.7 27.6 34.7 29.7 1887 15.6 26.8 27.4 34.7 28.9 85 The deaths registered in Camberwell (see Table IX.) during the year amounted to 4,011, of which 2,009 were of males, 2,002 ot females; and of which 58 were returned for Dulwich, 1,572 for Camberwell, 1,316 for Peckham, and 1,065 for St. George's. The deaths were more numerous than those occurring in 1886 by 18. There was an increase in Dulwich of 3, in Camberwell of 80, and in St. George's of 16, but a decrease of 81 in Peckham. Of the 1,572 deaths returned for the sub-district of Camberwell 333 occurred in the Workhouse and Infirmary, and 122 in the two Lunatic Asylums, making a total of 455 deaths, which, though included in the mortuary returns of this sub-district, no more belong properly to it than they do to the other sub-districts of the Parish. In order to determine the death-rates of the sub-districts it is necessary to distribute these deaths proportionately among them all. This has been done in Table VII., the last column of which gives the corrected returns. Tables VII.—Redistribution of Deaths among Sub-Districts of Camberwell. Deaths returned. Deaths in W.&L. A.

The following table comprises these death-rates, and, for the sake of comparison, those of 1886. Table VIII.—1,'eath-Rates of Camberwell and its Sub-Districts. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham.

For reasons which I discussed in my last year's report,. I entertain little doubt that the lowness of the death-rates is not wholly due to healthiness of the population, but that accidental circumstances of various kinds have influenced the figures, especially in certain districts. One source of fallacy is the fact that a considerable number of deaths due to the Parish occur annually in institutions outside the Parish.

The supplemental deaths here referred to are set forth in Table X. They amounted in 1887 to 232, of which 4 belonged to Dulwich, 88 to Camberwell, 93 to Peckham, and 47 to St. George's. Table XI. shows both the augmented deaths of the Parish and of its sub-districts due to this addition, and the augmented death-rates. It will be seen that the corrected death-rates are still singularly low. Table XI.—Deaths and Death-Rates of Camberwell and of its Sub-Districts obtained by including the 232 Deaths which occurred in Hospitals and elsewhere outside the Parish. Dulwich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's Parish. Deaths 70 1,348 1,577 1,248 4,243 Death-rates 10.2 15.3 16.0 19.1 16.5 Tables IX. and X. give the details of the returns of births and deaths for the year, arranged both according to districts and according to seasons. They also include an enumeration of the deaths according to ages and according to diseases. The deaths, as is always the case, are very unequally distributed among the different periods of life. Thus of the total parochial deaths for the year—namely, 1243—no fewer than 1,869, or 44 per cent., occurred under the age of 5. In Dulwich, where the birth-rate and death-rate are very low, 88 there were only 21 deaths per hundred of children under 5, while in the sub-district of Comberwell there were 42, in that of Peckham 43, and in St. George's 49. 95 deaths were attributed to accidental or other violence, of which 19 were of parishioners outside the boundaries of the Parish. Deaths from this cause were less numerous in 1887 than in 1886 by 18. 340 deaths are placed under the heading of premature birth or defective vitality, against 365 in the previous year. To childbirth 34 deaths are ascribed. In 1886 there were only 24. Inflammatory affections of the lungs caused 751 deaths, of which 361, or nearly half, were of children under five years of age. Of these, 231 occurred in the first quarter of the year, 191 in the second, 96 in the third, and 233 in the last. 819 deaths were ascribed to this cause in 1886. Diarrhœal affections were fatal in 239 instances, 219 times in children under five, and 20 in persons above that age. This mortality as usual was largest in the third quarter of the year, daring which time 207 deaths occurred. In the first quarter there were 10, in the second 11, and in the fourth also 11. Excepting Small-pox, of which not a single fatal case was recorded during the year, all the zymotic diseases caused a considerably larger mortality than they did in the previous year, as will be seen by reference to Tables XII. and XIII. The fatal cases of Hooping-cough increased from 156 to 203, those of Measles from 97 to 133, those of Diphtheria from 89 48 to 71, those of Scarlet Fever from 18 to 99, and those of different kinds of Fever from 30 to 41. 53 of the deaths from Hooping-cough occurred in Camberwell, 92 in Peckham, and 58 in St. George's. The disease prevailed chiefly in the second and third quarters of the year. Measles destroyed 44 lives in Camberwell, 44 in Peckham, and 45 in St. George's. This disease, also, was chiefly fatal in the second and third quarters. Scarlet Fever caused 27 deaths in Camberwell, 36 in Peckham, and 36 in St. George's. Its chief mortality was in the fourth quarter. Diphtheria caused two deaths in Dulwich, 28 in Camberwell, 23 in Peckham, and 14 in St. George's. Its prevalence was fairly uniform throughout the whole year. The several varieties of Continued Fever caused 14 deaths in Camberwell, 11 in Peckham, and 16 in St. George's. Out of 41 deaths from this cause 17 occurred in the last quarter of the year. Although, as I have shown, the mortality from zymotic diseases was considerably greater than that of the previous year, the mortality was not excessive, and does not call for any remark. Deaths from tubercular diseases, on the other hand, showed a considerable falling off as compared with 1886. There were 564 such deaths in the last year, and 657 in the year before. On the whole, there is no doubt that in Camberwell and its sub-districts, as well as in London and its groups of districts, the year has been a singularly healthy one. 90 The sanitary work done by the Inspectors in the year ending March 25th, 1888, is given in detail in Tables XIV. and XV. On the whole it differs very little in quality and amount for that done in the previous year. I may point out, however, that the primary inspections, which in the previous year amounted to 9,781, in the latter year amounted to only 8,772, and that the re-inspections which were 6,088 in the previous year, in the latter rose to 6,756. On the whole it may appear from these figures that less work was done in 1886-87, than in 1887-88; and to some extent this is true; for Inspector Mackay was incapacitated for some weeks during the last year, and Inspector Sedgley (though not actually laid by) has been ailing for some months, and has been unable to do his duties as efficiently as he did in former years. But, on the other hand, it is right that I should call attention to the fact that, during the last few years, the Inspectors have more and more been looking after the niceties of drainage, if I may use that expression, and ensuring as far as they can that, in all cases in which they discover grounds for interference, all really important sanitary requirements shall be carried out. The items (in the returns) of cleansing, trapping and repairing drains, which, together, amount to 4,024, of repairing closets which reach 1,538, of houses and yards drained into sewer which amount to 605, and of the disconnection of rain-water, sink, and other pipes from the sewers, which number 2,814, comprise, so far as this can be done in tabular form, the works to which I refer. We now, in fact, insist, systematically, on the absolute disconnection of the bath, sink, and rain-water pipes from the sewers; a point I need scarcely say of the highest sanitary importance, 91 inasmuch as it has hitherto been largely by their means that sewer gas has found its way into the interior of houses. I may here mention, parenthetically, that occasionally we have found the rain-water pipes actually doing service as soil pipes. It has been made a special duty with the Inspectors to see not merely that drains are trapped, but that the traps employed shall be of an efficient kind; and further, the Inspectors have made a systematic practice of testing the efficiency of all drainage arrangements by the newest and most approved methods, and of seeing by constant supervision that necessary drainage works are carried out strictly according to the requirements of the sanitary department. This kind of work, if done systematically and thoroughly, involves much time and labour; and it will be readily understood therefore that many of the units, which go to make up the totals in the tables, represent systematic work carried out from day to day, sometimes for a week or more together. I am satisfied that this comparatively new work is, and will prove, of the highest importance to the health of the Parish. I have to express my thanks to the Vestry for having, at my request, added a fifth Inspector to the sanitary stalf. The amount of tabulated work appearing under his name, in the present Report, is necessarily very small, for he only commenced active duty a week or two before the 25th of last March, on which day the Inspectors' year of duties ends.

PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES. 1.—All areas, basements, cellars, kitchens, and yards should he kept dry and clean, and, if necessary, well lime-whited. 2.—All water closets, sinks, and drains should be kept scrupulously clean, be regularly flushed with water, and have their traps in good order ; they should also, if at all offensive, be kept flushed with solution of Sulphate of Iron or Carbolic Acid. 3.—All dust bins should be emptied at least once a week, and no unnecessary or undue accumulations of offensive matters should be permitted anywhere. Such accumulation should (pending their removal) be disinfected by the free use of Chloride of Lime. 4.—All water-butts and cisterns should be kept clean and well covered. 5.—All houses, and especially the sleeping apartments, should he kept clean and well ventilated. 0.—Overcrowding should be avoided as much as possible. 98 MEASURES TO BE TAKEN WHEN SMALL POX OR FEVER OF ANY KIND IS PRESENT. 1.—Every person suffering from Small Pox or Fever should be placed as early as possible under the care of a qualified Medical Practitioner. 2.—The patient should be at once separated, as efficiently as circumstance will permit, from the other inmates of the house, and if possible, should be placed in a top room. A sheet kept wet with a solution made by thoroughly mixing a quarter of a pint of Carbolic Acid, No. 4, with a gallon of water, should be hung up outside the door. 3.—All bed-curtains and other hangings, and carpets, and all articles of dress, &c., in wardrobes and cupboards, should be removed from the room. 4.—The patient's room should be well ventilated, but not needlessly draughty; windows should be kept partially open, and the communication with the chimney free. A fire generally aids ventilation. 5.—Pieces of rag, being inexpensive, should be used for wiping discharges from the mouth and nose, and should be immediately burnt after use. G.—A basin, containing Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or some of a solution made by dissolving a pound of Green Copperas in a gallon of water, should be kept at hand to receive the patient's spit or vomit. 7.—The discharges from the bowels or kidneys should be received into vessels charged with the same disinfectants. 99 8.—A pail, also containing solution of Chloride of Lime, or of Condy's Fluid, or of Carbolic Acid, should stand in the room for the reception of ail bed and body linen after removal from the person of the patient. 9.—All glasses, cups, and other utensils should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 10.—The hands of the nurse should be washed with Carbolic Acid Soap, and rinsed in water containing Condy's Fluid: her dress should be of Cotton. 11.—All articles of dress in use by the nurse or patient, and all articles of a like kind liable to be infected, should before they are removed from the room in which the patient lies, be put into a solution of Chloride of Lime, or Condy's Fluid, or Carbolic Acid, and should afterwards be washed and boiled, or burnt. 12.—The room should be thoroughly disinfected after it has been emptied. A good plan is to burn from a quarter to half a pound of brimstone in an iron dish, supported over a pail of water in the middle of the room, the doors, windows, and other outlets having been previously closed. The room should remain closed for twenty-four hours. CAUTIONS. 1.—If any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, shall enter any public conveyance without previously notifying to the owner or driver thereof that he is so suffering, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 2.—Any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, who wilfully exposes himself, without proper precaution 100 against spreading the said disorder, in any street, public place, or public conveyance, and any person in charge of one so suffering who so exposes the sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Founds. 3.—Any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after it has conveyed any such sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Fivo Pounds. 4.—Any person who, without previous disinfection, gives, lends, sells, transmits, or exposes any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things that have been exposed to infection from such disorders, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 5.—If any person knowingly lets any house, room, or part of a house in which a person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder has been, to any other person, without having such house, room, or part of a house, and all articles therein liable to retain infection, disinfected to the satisfaction of a qualified Medical Practitioner, as testified by a certificate given by him, such person shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. 6.—When any dead body of one who has died of any infectious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep, any Justice may, on a certificate signed by a legally qualified Medical Practitioner, order the body to be removed to a mortuary at the cost of the Nuisance authority. NOTICES. 1.—IF ANY INFECTIOUS FEVER, appears in any place information should be at once given at the Yestry Hall to the Medical Officer, or to the Inspector of Nuisances. 101 2.—COMPLAINTS AS TO NUISANCES should be made personally or by letter to the Inspectors of Nuisances, and as to Non-removal of Dust, to the Dust Superintendent at the Yestry Hall. 3.—DISINFECTANTS may be had gratis on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 4.—A DISINFECTING APPARATUS has been provided by the Yestry at the Parish Stone Yard, Peckham Park Road, at which bedding and articles of apparel may be disinfected gratis, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 5.—A MORTUARY has been provided in St. George's road, adjoining St. George's Church, whither dead bodies may be at once removed, and where they may remain until the time of burial, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. Dated 9th day of December, 1876. 103 1887-88, ANALYST'S REPORTS. Chemical Labobatory, St. Thomas's Hospital, Medical and Surgical College, S.E. June 21th, 1887. To the Vestry of Camber well, Gentlemen, I have to render a much more favourable report, and I do so with pleasure. Of twenty-three Milks, only three were adulterated with, respectively, 9, 23 and 15 per cent. of water. I do not say that others were not adulterated, but these three were the only ones which could have been prosecuted. Of seven Butters, one was admixed with fat, other than butterfat, to the extent of over 50 per cent. 104 Tour Peppers and one Mustard were of excellent quality. With the amount of adulteration so general in peppers, this statement is very creditable. Six Coffees were also found to be perfectly genuine. Two samples of Honey were of very fair quality, and the same may be said of three varieties of Jam. In conclusion, I have examined three Beers and one Porter They were of good quality. The certificates are in the hands of your Inspectors. Michaelmas, 1887. During the last Quarter thirty samples of Milk have been submitted to me for analysis; of these, six were adulterated with, respectively, 18, 20, 18, 12, 16, and 10 per cent. of water. These do not represent the whole number watered, as some are skilfully brought up to the standard fixed. Samples of Butter, four in number, were fairly of the nature, substance, and quality demanded. One of them contained nearly the highest amount of water allowed, and was very salt. Bread, Flour, and Coffee were of good quality. The Drugs, four in number, comprised one specimen of Bromide of Potassium, and three specimens of Sulphate of Quinine. They all corresponded with genuine articles. 105 All the certificates, fifty in number, are in the hands of your Inspectors. December 25th, 1887. I have examined thirty samples of Milk during the quarter, some of them of very high quality, bringing them up to the standard of the Society of Public Analysts rather than to that of Somerset House. Six Milks out of the thirty were adulterated with, respectively, 24, 24, 19, 15, 9, and 9 per cent. of water. No. 148 must have been skimmed by machinery, to such perfection had it been brought, and watered at least to the extent of 9.0 per cent. Seven others were fully adulterated up to the mark allowed by yourselves. Partly owing to the lowering of the standard by Somerset House and partly to the kindness of the Vestries and Boards, there is now an average allowance of 10.0 per cent. of adulteration through the kingdom. We occasionally have vendors selling milks, practically identical, with their five per cent. of added water; in such cases it would be well if the cow-keepers could be made to prove that such milks are possible. Anyhow it is rather hard upon retailers of milk that when a certain amount of adulteration is permitted they themselves should not share in the advantage. Of two Butters analysed, one had been tampered with to a slight extent, but was passed for obvious reasons. Three Coffees, four Mustards, and two Peppers were distinctly of the nature, substance, and quality demanded. The same may be said of three varities of Sweetstuffs. A sample of Ale was a distinct improvement upon the past. 106 Of a Gin and five Whiskies something may be said. The gin was as usual either sweetened or unsweetened spirit. Of the whiskies, one was ten degrees below the standard, and one rather more than one degree; on the other hand one was four degrees and another seven degrees above the standard. May I be allowed to express the opinion that no single thing can be more promotive of intemperance than the variations in the strength of spirits allowed by authority. Au reste, the certificates are all in the hands of the Inspectors. Lady-Day, 1888. In reporting upon the Milks this Quarter, I have to remark that they have been much influenced by the weather. Even making the allowance for water to which the Sanitary Committee has consented, we have nine out of 23 adulterated with respectively 26, 25, 1, 12, 29, 9, 17, 10 and 5 per cent. of added water. Thirty-eight per cent. of added wafer, in one hundred Milks of a single Quarter, is an unusual occurrence at Camberwell. Fourteen Butters have been examined. Only one Butter was altogether the so-called Margarine. The sample of Margarine, sold as such, was perfectly clean, and as free from taste as any fat could possibly be, except for the salt. One of the genuine Butters contained 13.65 per cent. of water and 6.35 per cent. of salt, and was just up to the standard of allowed admixture. But, as I presume that no one could buy 107 butter without tasting it, so I consider that no one could have bought this butter, unless he thought it was a cheap purchase of salt. One Bread, three Peppers, and two Mustards were altogether of the nature, substance, and quality demanded. The Whiskies, six in number, were, as regards the alcohol, up to the standard. One of them was nearly seven per cent. above standard. A peculiarity of one whiskey was that it contained free sulphuric acid amounting to 0024 per cent., or at the rate of 16.8 grains per gallon. This quantity would not be injurious, and is a part of one of the prescriptions for "making" whiskey which I find in one of my books. I need not say that whiskey does not generally contain it, and that it is the first time that I have met with it, except in prescriptions. / The certificates are all in the possession of the Inspectors. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS. 109 VESTRY CLERK'S REPORT. Your Vestry Clerk begs to submit the following Report upon some of the chief questions which have been under the consideration of the Vestry during the past year:— MEETINGS. During the year the following Meetings of the Vestry, and ts Committees have taken place:— Vestry Meetings 32 Standing Committee Meetings 97 Special and Sub-Committee Meetings 248 Parish Officers' Meetings 58 Total 435 annual accounts. The Accounts of the Vestry for the year ending the 25th March, 1888, will be found at pages 151 to 230 of this Report. They have been examined by the Auditors elected by the Vestry under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts. From the Abstracts and Summaries of Accounts it appears that the expenditure of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London together exceed more than one-third of the total amount raised by the Vestry, and it must not be forgotten that over the items of expenditure of these two authorities this Vestry has no control. bills in parliament (public). Local Govern- -phis Bill was introduced into Parliament by the ment Bill. Right Hon. C. T. Ritchie, President of the Local Government Board, on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, on the 19th 110 March last. It is the most important Bill brought in during this present session, effecting a complete revolution in the parochial government of the country. The Bill establishes two new County Authorities elected by household suffrage. These authorities are (a) the County Council, (ft) the District Council. The County Council is to be composed partly of selected Councillors, to be called County Aldermen, and of elected County Councillors each appointed for the term of three years, and the divisions of the county for the purpose of election of Councillors are to be called electoral divisions. The number of County Councillors for the County of London to be double the number of Members returned to Parliament for the Parliamentary Boroughs. The number of elected Councillors, the area, and population to constitute an electoral division, is to be determined by the Local Government Board. The County Council, will be the great administrative and financial centre in the County of the future, having the administrat ive and financial businesses of the Justices of the County in quarter sessions assembled. The Council is at once to manage most of the concerns of county government itself, and to control the action of the District Councils. The duties may thus be set forth:— Administration—levying of county rates, music licensing, maintenance of main roads and bridges, management of lunatic asylums, control of reformatory and industrials schools, division of County into Parliamentary election districts, matters connected with registration and the fixing of places to hold revision courts, appointment of Officers paid out of County Rate, enforcement of the provisions of Rivers Pollution Act, management of Contagious Diseases Acts (Animals), destructive insects, weights and measures, adulteration ot food and drugs, recording of places of worship, and registration of scientific societies, and many other duties. Control: laking over the powers of the Local Goverment Board,and Board of I Trade in regard to provisional orders concerning piers and harbours, electric lighting, gas and water, tramways, 1ll the sanctioning of market tolls, the settling of boundaries, and fixing of limits of new districts for the local councils, artisan dwellings, and public health. The Poor Law is to be left mainly as at present, under the control of Boards of Guardians. Financial:—the new County Council will have power of borrowing money for county purposes. Various license duties are transferred to the County Council. It will be compelled to issue a yearly budget of its receipts and expenditure, and the Local Government Board retains its powers of audit and control. London, as defined by the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the City, is to be a County in itself, with a Lord Lieutenant, a Bench of Magistrates, and a County Council. The Metropolitan Board is to cease to exist, and it powers and duties is to be transferred to the County Council. The police will be managed by a joint Committee of the County Council and Quarter Sessions Magistrates, with the exception of those of the Metropolis and City of London. The first election of County Councillors will take place in January next. The present Bill does not touch Vestries and Disitrict Boards, but Mr. Ritchie stated it was the intention of the Government to make a proposal at a future time, "Not on the lines of creating separate municipalities for London, but of amalgamating within certain defined areas the existing Yestries, and Local Boards, and of constructing a County Council, having large and important administrative functions." The District Council is to be elected by the householders of the district, and will generally take the place of the Local Boards now exercising jurisdiction in the urban and rural sanitary districts. There will be transferred to the District Council for each district, other than a borough, the powers, duties, property, debts, and liabilities; If the district is an urban district, of the Improvement Commissioners or local Board, whether under any general or local and personal Acts, or otherwise, and if it is a rural district, of the rural sanitary authority, and such Improvement 112 missioners, local Board, and rural sanitary authority shall cease to exist, and the District Council shall be deemed to be in law the successors of such Improvement Commissioners, local Board, and rural sanitary authority. This is subject to any powers that are transferred to the County Council. It is also provided that there shall be transferred to the District Council, all the powers, duties, and liabilities of a highway Board, and of the inhabitants in Vestry assembled of any Parish, and of a Surveyor of Highways for such Parish. Every Highway Board, Surveyor of Highways, or District Surveyor shall cease to hold office or be elected, and all the property of any such Board, inhabitants Surveyor, or District Surveyor held for the purposes of the highways shall pass to the District Council. To the District Council there will be powers and duties in regard to Acts regulating lighting and watching, baths and washhouses. labouring classes' lodging houses,public libraries, burial,and the public improvement Act, 1860, save where the County Council has jurisdiction. The following will be transferred to District Council: licensing of gang masters and dealers in game, certificates for pawnbrokers, hawkers, passage brokers and emigrant runners, police appeals re pedlars certificates, abolition of fairs, the administration of Acts concerning petroleum, infant life protection, and dogs. 1 he Vestry of the 28th March last referred the Bill to the Law and Parliamentary Committee, together with the Chairman of each of the remainingStanding Committees for consideration and report. On the 18th Apr 1 last, the Vestry, upon their recommendation, approved of the transfer of the powers now vested in the Metropolitan Bourd of Works to a County Council for the whole ol The Metropolis, but was of opinion that such County Council should consist exclusively of representatives directly elected by 113 the Ratepayers, and recomended that with the exception of a sufficient number of Police to protect the national property, the Police Force for the County of London should be under the control of the London County Council. The Committee further recommended that inasmuch as the Bill in its present form did not provide for the election of District Councils for the Metropolis, they deferred making a final report until after the proposals affecting the Metropolitan District Councils weremade known and submitted to Parliament. Parliamentary This Bill, introduced by Mr. Stansfield, amends the and Municipal Elector's Reg- istration Ball." law respect to Regulation of Electors at Parliamentary and Municipal Elections, it alters the period of qualification to three months, repeals the necessity for persons to be assessed or rated, places the responsibility upon Overseers of making enquiries as to Lodgers, successive occupation from different qualifying premises to qualify for vote, Registration Officer to be appointed by Local Authorities, and provides for a supplemental Register of Claimants occupying three months to be made up to 31st December. It has now been dropped. Occupiers' Disqualification This is anther Bill dealing with the Registration Removal Bill. Laws,and proposes to enact that soldiers, and others absent on service shall not be disqualified for not having been in continuous occupation. This Bill is now in Committee. Metropolitan Fire Brigade This Bill empowers the Metropolitan Board of Works Expenses. Rate for the Metropolitan Fire Brigade to be raised from one halfpenny to a penny, and gives the Board power to provide Plugs and Hydrants, it also raises the contributions of the Fire Insurance Companies from £35 to £40 in a million. The Vestry presented a Petition in favor of this Bill when before Parliament last year, and passed a resolution asking the Board to put into communication all Fire Brigade Stations with Post Offices. This Bill is now dropped. 114 Housing of the Is Bill to further amend the Law relating to the Working Classes. Dwellings of the Working Classes and the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Acts, 1875 to 1885, it increases the penalties on owners of dwellings for disobedience of an order requiring abatement of nuisance, makes it an obligation of every Vestry and District Board to make Bye-laws respecting lodging houses, and gives power of inspection of cellar dwellings. The Local Government are authorised upon a written representation of at least six ratepayers in a district, to hold an enquiry as to whether the local authority have failed to do their duty under Section Seven of the Housing of the Working Classes' Act, 1885, and if such representation is well founded, the Board shall issue an order dissolving the local authority in default, and directing a a fresh election of Members. Burials Bill. Proposes to vest the powers relating to the burial of the dead now vested in one of Her Majesty's Princ pal Secretaries of State in the Local Government Board, and gives additional powers in respect of the compulsory purchase of land, services, &c. Parliamentary Elections (Re-Provides that the expenses of the Returning Officer for turning Officers' Expenses). Parliamentary Elections shall be paid out of the local rates. [Dropped]. Parliamentary Elections (Meetings in Proposes that all schoo's receiving grants out of moneys School.) provided by Parliament shall be lent for the use of Parliamentary Members, or Candidates. [Dropped]. School Borad for London Election Redistributes areas, increasing the number of divisions from 11 to 19 to elect 55 members instead of 71. Increases the number from 4 to 5 for the East Lambeth Division, viz:-the Parishes of Camberwell and Newington. The Vestry on the 28th March last resolved to take no action in respect of this Bill. 115 Metropolitan This Bill has been drafted by the Metropolitan Board Board of Works Local Manage- ment,&c. of Works and relates to the Metropolis, and is to remedy defects found to exist in carrying out the Metropolitan Management Acts, it contains powers to alter Parish Wards, to give time between the nomination of Vestrymen and Polling day, to make up qualification for Vestrymen where owner pays rates for different premises, to the Local Authority to temporarily repair any new thoroughfare, pending dedication, so as make it passable for the inhabitants. This proviso is inserted in consequence of the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of the Vestry of Camberwell v. Hunt for Alleyn Park paving, reported on pages 154 to 157 of last year's Report. The Bill also proposes to give power to the Board to lend the first cost of paving a New Street (at present there is no power to lend or borrow) where the cost is spread over a period, another clause prohibits the taking out of gravel and sand in the middle of a New Street and filling up with rubbish, owing to which practice gas and water pipes have subsided and caused explosions, flooding, and other damage, a penalty is imposed for contravention of buildings not within the rules of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Vestry of Kensington convened a conference upon this Bill at which Messrs. Middlemass, Wallace, and Phillips were appointed Delegates by this Vestry. This Bill has now been dropped. Personal pro- This Bill was introduced by Mr. E. Robertson, and perty, exemp- tion from sale. backed by other Members, for the purpose of exempting Personal Property (to a limited value) from seizure and sale under legal process, representations were made by the Vestry of Islington, that a clause should be inserted that the Bill should not apply to any execution or process for the recovery of Poor or Parochial Rates, Mr. Robertson has agreed to accept such amendment. This has now been dropped. 116 The Rating This Bill is designed to meet the difficulty raised by of Hoardings. the decision of the Courts of Justice, that a person is not liable to rates for his advertising stations or hoardings placed on a portion of premises which are being rebuilt, inasmuch as the judges were unable to regard the nature of the interest as an occupation, but only as a temporary holding for advertising. This Bill provides that the owner of any land used, whether temporarily or permanently, for the exhibition of advertisements, or for the erection of a hoarding or structure to be used, or capable of being used, for this purpose, but not otherwise occupied, is to be rateable on the value derived or derivable from its use. So also where land occupied for other purposes is used, whether temporily or permanently, for the exhibition of advertisements, &c., the rateable value is to be so estimated as to include the increased value derived or derivable from this use. Another provision of the Bill is that, where a Corporation, Board, Vestry, Sanitary Authority, &c., grants under a statutory power a licence for the temporary erection of a hoarding or other structure upon any public highway, or upon any of its property, it may include in this license a condition prohibiting the affixing of any advertisement, or sanctioning it upon some payment. In case this condition is not complied with the penalty may be £5, and 40s. for every day during the continuance of the offence. Any penalty so recovered is directed to be applied in aid of the rate levied by the authority for the repair of the highway(Dropped]. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT (PRIVATE). The Private Bills introduced into Parliament this session, affecting this Parish, will be found dealt with in the Surveyors' Report ou pages 10 to 15 and are as follows:— 117 LONDON, CAMBERWELL AND DULWICH TRAMWAYS' BILL. This Bill which proposed to give the Company power to construct a Tramway from the "King's Arms" P. H., Peckham rye, to Forest hill Cemetery, and also further powers with respect to the route down Rye lane, received the approval of the Yestry, and after passing through the Commons was thrown out by the House of Lords' Committee. TUBLIC BATHS AND BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. "The Vestry having resolved on 16th February, 1887, that it is desirable to establish Public Baths and Wash-houses in the Parish of Camberwell, appointed a Committee to consider the best means of giving effect to such resolution. This Committee in their Report to the Yestry stated that it did not come within the province of the Committee to enter into the many and weighty reasons which in their opinion might be urged in favour of the adoption of the Public Baths and Wash-houses Act in the Parish, further than to state, that after careful consideration the Members had come to the conclusion that, regarding the extent of the Parish and its large and increasing population, the present bathing accommodation is altogether inadequate and is beyond the means of vast numbers of the people for whom the Act specially provides. The Committee in the first instance, entered into communication with other Parishes which had adopted the Act, and obtained much valuable information, including the cost of erection and maintenance of their establishments, and how defrayed, and to what extent the Baths and Wash-houses are used. It was gratifying to the Committee to find that in the majority of cases the Commissioners report an excess of receipts over working expenses, and were unanimously of opinion that the d option of the Act had been a great boon to their Parishes. 118 The next step taken by the Committee was to make a personal inspection of the Baths at Forest Hill and Lady well, and the Baths and Wash-houses at Rotherhithe, Bermondsey, St. James's, Westminster, St. Pancras and Paddington. By this means the various establishments were seen at work, and a mass of additional information was placed at the service of the Committee by the courtesy of the Commissioners and the Managers, which has been found most useful in the preparation of this Report. The Committee having carefully and anxiously considered the matter in all its bearings, were of opinion that to provide adequate Bathing and Washing accommodation for the whole of the Parish, it is advisable to erect three bathing establishments,, to be placed in the parliamentary divisions of North Camberwell, Peckham, and Dulwich ; with the addition of Wash-houses for North Camberwell and Peckham. The Committee having seen to what extent Bathing and Washing accomodation had been provided at the establishments visited, and the cost thereof, were of opinion that their recommendation could be carried into effect for a sum not exceeding £05,000, to be obtained on loan, to be repayable by instalments spread over 30 years. Having regard to the experience of other parishes which proves that the profits on the trading accounts are in proportion to the accommodation afforded, and taking into consideration the tact that in the majority of cases the profits partly pay the interest and repayment of loans (notably in St. Marylebone,. where the profits have relieved the rates to the extent of £54,085, and in St. 1 ancras, where in ten years £15,883 were paid out of profits toward loans and interest), the Committee confidently anticipated that by a judicious selection of the sites for the 119 establishments, a considerable portion of the expenses for erection, &c., would be met out of the profits realized. In the event of this not being the case, the average rate necessary to be levied would be less than Id. in the pound. The Committee strongly and unanimously urged the Vestry to come to a decision which would confer upon the Parish a boon of the highest order, and one which cannot fail to promote the cleanliness, health, and general well-being of the people. The Vestry having adopted the Report of the Special Committee, a Meeting of the Vestry was upon a written request of thirty-two Ratepayers and another of eighteen Members of the Vestry duly convened for the purpose of considering and determining whether the Act of 9 and 10 Victoria,Cap. 74, intituled— " An Act to encourage the establishment of Public Baths and Wash-houses" should be adopted for this Parish, and it was unanimously resolved that such Act should be adopted. The consent of the Secretary of the Local Government Board was received, and upon the 7tli of December last the following Commissioners were appointed, Messrs. J. T. Sears, R. Strong, J. Duckett, W. L. Dowton, G. L. Turney, E. C. Davis, and R. T. Bonsall. Mr. Sears was elected Chairman of the Commissioners, and the following wTas the first Report of such Commissioners:— report of the commissioners of public baths and wash-houses of camberwell. We, the Commissioners, beg to report that we considered it advisable, immediately after our appointment by the Vestry, to inspect the Public Baths situated at Lewisham and at Forest Hill which have been recently erected, as also those at Rotherhitlie, where both Washhouses and Baths are built and are now in good working order, with a view of ascertaining the extent, fittings, 120 machinery, and general requirements of these buildings. Having ascertained the area necessary, and obtained such information as would, in our judgment, assist us in carrying into effect the duties confided to us by the Vestry, for the erection of Public Baths and Wash-houses, we caused advertisements to be inserted in the South London Press, Camberwell and Pecltham Times, The Builder, The Standard, and The Daily News, for three consecutive weeks, one insertion each Aveek, stating that the Commissioners were prepared to receive offers of freehold sites suitable for the erection of Baths and Wash-houses in the Parish, and to furnish the particulars as to the situation, area, and lowest price required for the purchase. In response to such advertisement, we received twelve offers of sites indifferent parts of the Parish, and in order to obtain as large a number of offers as possible to select from, it was decided to continue the advertisements for a further period of three weeks in the following local papers:— South London Press, Camberwell and Pecltham Times, and South London Mail, which resulted in three additional offers, making a total of fifteen. We accordingly viewed all the sites that were considered by us to be in a good position for the purpose, and all, we regret to state, with the exception of the site of the Birkbeck Schools, Willowbroolc road, Avere deemed unsuitable either in area, position, or price. Enquiries are, however, being made in reference to sites for other portions of the Parish. The Birkbeck Schools site offered many advantages both In position, area, and the possibility of utilizing the present buildings for the purposes of Baths, Wash-houses, and the necessary Offices. The price asked by Mr. Pennack, 121 the Freeholder, was £65,000, which was considered too high, and after correspondence and an interview with him he consented to reduce the price to £4,500, and offered a strip of land running by the side of the buildings, for an additional £250 (this strip of land is an important part of the area required,) making the purchase money £4,750. Before proceeding further with the negotiations, we felt it desirable to obtain the practical opinion of Mr. J. C. Reynolds, your Surveyor, on the question of the adaptability of the present buildings for the erection of public Baths and Wash-houses, and he was good enough (although not within his duties) to view the same, and he reported to us that he was of opinion that the present buildings appeared to be of a character convertible for the purpose of Baths and Wash-houses. In addition to his judgment, we considered it advisable to have a detailed report prepared respecting the buildings, by another professional man, and accordingly instructed Mr. Thos. Wilkins, Surveyor, of Lyndhurst road, to advise the Commissioners upon the following points, viz. : — (i) Whether the present buildings can be advantageously and usefully converted into suitable Public Baths, Wash-houses, with the necessary Offices. (ii) If such buildings are, in his opinion, convertible for such purposes, what should be the position, measurement, and manner of the construction of such Baths, Wash-houses, and necessary Offices. 122 (iii) The depth of the present concrete foundation of the premises, and how much (if any) fresh concrete would be required, also what iron work for supports, also in view of the buildings being used during winter months as gymnasium, &c.

(ix) And to report generally on the subject for the information and guidance of the Commissioners. A Copy of his Report is appended hereto, with plans of the premises, which we submit to the Vestry. We had a long interview with Mr. W ilkins when he afforded us additional information and explanation in respect of his 123 port. We arrived at the decision after careful consideration that the Birkbeck Schools Site was an eligible site, havingregard to the present buildings, areas, and their locality, and one which might advantageously be utilised for the erection of Public Baths and Wash-houses for that part of the Parish. We submit the foregoing for the consideration of the Vestry, and invite their opinion thereon. If in favour of its purchase, we, in pursuance of the 9th and 10th Victoria, Cap. 74, ask the Vestry's consent to borrow £15,000, to be repaid with interest by 30 yearly instalments, to be secured on mortgage on the Rates for the Relief of the Poor of the Parish. We also have to ask the Vestry to make an Order on the Overseers of the Poor of this Parish for the sum of £100, on account of the expenses of carrying the above Act into execution, such sum to be chargeable upon the Poor Rate of the Parish. All c f which is submitted. Given under our Corporate Seal this 6th day of June, 1888. By order, L- S. GEO. W. MARSDEN, Clerk to the Coviviissioners. 124 Report to the Commissioners of Public Baths and Wash-houses of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, respecting the adaptability and expediency of converting the present buildings on the Birkbeck School Site, Willowbrook road, Peckham, to the purpose of Baths and Wash-houses, by Mr. Thomas Wilkins, Associate and Science Prizeman of King's College, London, Prizeman of the Society of Engineers, Westminster. 6, Great St. Helens, London, E.C., May 16th, 1888. Question No. 1:— Whether the present buildings can be advantageously and usefully converted into suitable Public Baths, Washhouses, with the necessary offices. Answer:— The buildings on the Birkbeck School Site are considerably narrower than the width found most suitable for swimming baths; and owing to difference in the rise of the various roofs, considerable expense would be entailed in throwing two suites of rooms into one large room. The shape of the ground has also necessitated a want of uniformity in the lengths of the different suites of rooms; and this would be a further obstacle to converting any two suites or portions of any two suites into one large room. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, and for the present not considering the price, I am of opinion that the existing buildings can be advantageously and usefully converted into suitable Baths and the necessary offices; but that it 125 would be necessary to use the piece of vacant ground fronting the Willowbrook road, for the Wash-houses and for the Steam Boilers and Machinery. Question No. 2:— If such buildings are, in his opinion, convertible for such purposes, what should be the position, measurement, and manner of the construction of such Baths, Wash-houses, and necessary offices. Ansiver:— Reference being made to the accompanying plan, traced from the one furnished by the Vendor, and on which the rooms of existing buildings are marked respectively A, B, C, D, E, F, Gr, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and adjacent rooms, practically under one roof, are cross-hatched similarly. I am of opinion that the best way of utilising these buildings as Baths will be to have in A a swimming bath 60-ft. long by 25-ft. wide at the surface of the water, and to construct dressing boxes along one side and at the two ends. Room could be found for from 33 to 45 of these dressing boxes, according to the accommodation to be given. If the room A were lengthened by building upon the vacant space R, the bath in this room could be made 100-ft. long, and the number of dressing boxes might be 55 to 70. The rooms B, C, and D might be thrown into one and used for a swimming bath about 55-ft. long, and 18-ft. wide at the water surface, with dressing boxes for, from 35 to 45 persons. 126 The room E can be sub-divided and used for men's ticket office, and waiting rooms; a portion might also be used for hot baths. F on the plan is the site of the Caretaker's rooms, consisting of three bed-rooms upon the upper floor, and kitchen, scullery, passage and staircase on lower floor. The lower floor is very inconveniently arranged, and should be remodelled. If it should be desired to have a third swimming bath for men, it should be in the room Gr, and might be 50-ft, long, by 18-ft. wide at the water surface, otherwise this room might be utilised for hot baths. The rooms H, I might he thrown into one, and partitioned for 12 hot baths. If it is desired to have a swimming bath for women and young children, the rooms J, K might be utilised for that purpose, By converting them into one room a bath 38-ft. long, by 18-ft. wide at the water surface, could be obtained. The room L could be sub-divided partly for use as women's ticket office and waiting rooms, and partly for use as hot baths for women. With respect to the Wash-houses, buildings should be erected upon the vacant land marked P, Q. The Steam Boilers should be at P, the fires being towards the canal, and portions of the vacant space between the existing buildings and the boundary wall next the 127 •canal could be used as a coal store, the coals being delivered by water. The Wash-houses should be at Q, where there would be sufficient space for 70 to 80 women washing at the same time. The space above the Steam Boilers and the rooms M, N, would be utilised for the drying horses, and for mangles, hydro-extractors, and ironing tables. The present w.c.'s at 0 are wholly unsuitable, and the space might be utilised for second class hot baths for women. The Urinals at S are also unsuitable. It is found desirable to have urinals and w.c.'s convenient to each swimming bath, and the best positions for these can only be decided upon when preparing a general plan of the premises to a larger scale. Question No. 3:— The depth of the present concrete foundation of the premises and how much (if any) fresh concrete would be required. Also, what iron-work for supports. Also in view of the buildings being used during the winter months as gymnasium, &c. Ayiswer:— The present concrete foundations, where opened by the vendor for my inspection, extended to a depth of 5-ft. 9-in. below the floor line. The bed of concrete is 4-ft. wide by 2-ft. 3-in. thick. I do not think the present walls would need underpinning. 128 1 would advise that the swimming baths be made of concrete, and if this be carefully done, the portion below the level of the present foundation can be put in without disturbing the present foundations, and will act as a retaining wall. Question No. 4:— The height and elevation of the Baths, Wash-houses, and Offices, that could be erected out of the present buildings and strip of land adjoining, and wrhether it would be necessary to heighten the present roof. Answer:— The existing buildings are 14-ft. 6-in. to 15-ft. high from the floor line to the pole plates, i.e., to the top of the walls, which will be quite high enough. With respect to using the buildings as a gymnasuim during the winter, the rooms are high enough for all ordinary gymnastic appliances, except the trapeze. N o great expense need be incurred in providing supports for those appliances which are hung from the Avails or roof. The roofs therefore need not be heightened for Baths. Question No. 5:— Whether a neAv front and entrance to the premises would be required. Ansivcr:— In my opinion it is unnecessary to put a neAv front to the existing building. I would suggest that any new building decided upon should be made to harmonise Avith 129 the present front. The present entrances can be used, one for men's baths, the other for women's baths. The entrance to the Wash-houses should be from the Willowbrook road to the new building at Q on plan. If desired there might be a first and second-class entrance for men, a second entrance being provided in the prolongation of the building A which I suggest should be erected at R. The buildings at R,Q, and O should be so constructed, with reference to the existing front, as to give a uniform and agreeable elevation. Question No. 6:— To what extent the materials at present forming part of the premises will be available for such alterations. Answer:— It will be necessary to remove the wooden floors from the swimming bath room. The sloping floors in the rooms •suggested to be used for ironing and drying rooms can be lowered to a proper level by altering the piers beneath them. This will be an awkward job. Hence it is only where it Avill be unnecessary to remove the floors that they will be of any value except as old material. The bricks from the walls, which I suggest should be removed to throw two or more rooms into one, can be used again in the new constructions suggested. Question No. 7:— Whether the warming apparatus and boilers on the premises could be utilised, and to what extent. Answer:— The boilers of the present warming apparatus being 130 situated beneath the floor of room D, would have to ber removed if that room is thrown into one with B and C. They are in a most inconvenient position for getting fuel to them and for firing. In the rooms with sloping floors also, there are heaters which would require to be placed at a different level. Most of these warming pipes could be used again, but the value of the apparatus is not more than its value as second hand material. Question No. 8:— What the estimated saving will be in using the present buildings in lieu of constructing an entirely new building for Baths, Wash-houses, and Offices. Answer:— I am of opinion that a saving of £2,500 to £2,800,. would be effected by using the existing buildings instead of constructing similar new walls, and roofs for the proposed Baths, and Wash-liouses, and it is probable that if entirely new buildings were decided upon, plans would be submitted that would entail a considerably greater outlay, than the cost of the additions and alterations I suggest, together with the sum above mentioned, will amount to. (Question No. 9:— And to report generally on the subject for theinformation and guidance of the Commissioners. Answer:— the alterations suggested would give a very commodious establishment, with two or three class men's swimming baths; two or three class hot baths; a women's swimming bath, with two class hot baths; care-taker's 131 residence; boiler and machinery house; wash-house for 70 to 80 women, with all usual conveniences; at a cost which I roughly estimate at £6,500 to £7,000, inclusive of the boilers and machinery, but not inclusive of the cost of the site and buildings existing thereon. The above mentioned baths would give accommodation at one time in all for 110 to 130 persons in the men's swimming baths, 40 to 45 persons in the men's hot baths, 16 persons in the women's swimming baths, and 20 Persons in the women's hot baths. Probably if the existing buildings were totally unsuitable, the Commissioners would hesitate to give such extensive and varied accommodation in this spot. I have ascertained from the Vestry Surveyor that there is a 3-ft. by 2-ft. brick sewer in the Sumner road, sufficiently below the level of the surface of the roadway, to insure suitable drainage from the baths, if constructed of the same depth as is usual. In the rough estimate given allowance is not made for pumping or filtering the water. The Commissioners would have to take into consideration whether it would be cheaper (1) to purchase from the Water Company the very large supply of water that will be required (about 10 million gallons per annum), (2) to sink a well, and pump water as is done in many large establishments in London, or (3) to take water from the canal and filter it by methods similar to those adopted in the floating bath that was for some years moored in the Thames by Charing Cross Bridge. The determination of this point will depend very much upon the terms offered by the Water Company. 132 The subsoil of the site being a loamy and sandy Gravel, materials for concrete are in abundance on the premises. This should be taken into consideration in estimating the value of the property. The total area of the site is a little more than 2-roods 15-perches. In making this Report, I have followed the nine headings submitted for my guidance as to the information desired by the Commissioners. (Signed) THOS. WILKINS. CANTERBURY ROAD BRIDGE. The Metropolitan Board of Works having inserted clauses in their Various Powers Bill enabling them to erect a Bridge across the Grand Surrey Canal. The following are the clauses therein contained:— 1. To give power to the Board to purchase and take the existing swing bridge. 2. To give power to the Vestry and District Board to contribute towards the expenses to be incurred in the erection of the bridge. ii. To give power to any person under disability to subscribe, and to convey land without compensation. 4. If the contributions shall amount to one-half of the estimate of the cost of the bridge and approaches, after allowing for the re-sale of the land not required, to construct the bridge within twelve months after the passing of this Bill. 133 5. That 011 the completion of the bridge and approaches the carriage and footways shall be formed and laid out,, and shall be used by the public, and the maintenance, repair, cleansing and lighting shall be under the management and jurisdiction of either this Yestry or the District Board in the like manner as other public roads, on such terms and subject to such conditions as may be agreed upon, or in the event of difference as shall be settled by the Board. The Bill passed into Law, and the Yestry received a letter from the Metropolitan Board of Works stating that the total estimate of the cost of the bridge and approaches (after deducting the value of the land promised to be given without compensation), was £13,400, and that the Board was only willing to carry out the improvement upon condition that one half of the cost was contributed by the Yestry and the Owners of the land required to be given up to make the approaches, that the promised contribution did not amount to £6,700 and asking whether this Yestry were prepared to increase their contributions, so as to bring the amount of promised contributions to the required amount. The General Purposes Committee in conference with a Deputation of the Greenwich Board of Works, held on the 23rd February, 1887, passed a recommendation to the Yestry, that in the opinion of the joint Committees the cost of the bridge and approaches should not exceed £10,000, the limit fixed by the Resolution of the Yestry of the 20th January, 1886. This recommendation was confirmed by the Vestry and the District Board of Works. The resolution of the Vestry, and the increased estimate of the Metropolitan Board of Works,created a considerable difficulty in carrying out the work, the Metropolitan Board of Works having only statutory power to proceed if the contribution of the Vestry shall amount to one-half of the estimated cost of 134 the bridge. The Vestry again took the request of the Board into their consideration, and not being inclined to alter their resolution that the expense should not exceed £10,000, instructed me to refer them to the resolution of the Vestry, that the expense should not exceed that amount. The Board however passed a resolution that they could only proceed with the work upon the following conditions, viz:—" That the Land-owners give up the land required for the bridge and approaches, that the Local Authorities and Land-owners contribute £6,000, that an agreement be entered into for carrying out the arrangement," and requested to be informed whether the Vestry were prepared to accept these conditions. The General Purposes Committee on receipt of this letter, deemed it advisable again to invite a Deputation of the Greenwich Board of Works, to meet them to consider the best course to be adopted. After much consideration, it was agreed to recommend a contribution of a moiety not exceeding £6000 of the actual cost of the bridge. The Vestry and the Greenwich Board of Works confirmed the recommendation of the joint Committees. This resolution was communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works and led to much controversy with that Board, inasmuch as the Board considered that they had no power to proceed with the erection of the bridge, unless the Vestry and Greenwich Board of Works and Owners agreed to pay one-half of the estimated expenses as required by the Boards' Various Powers Act. The Vestry which had already increased their contribution from £1,000 to £1800, would not make any further advance. The difference was happily settled by the perseverence of the representatives of this Vestry at the Metropolitan Board, and it was finally agreed that the value of the land agreed to be given up should be part of the contribution of the Owners, and thus the requirements of the Statute complied with. An agreement has now been prepared, whereby the Vestry, the District Board of Works; and 135 Owners agree to pay their respective contributions, and the Freeholders and Lesees agree to convey the land required to effect the improvement, and pay their contribution as agreed. This agreement has been duly executed by all parties, and the Seal of the Yestry affixed. I learn that Tenders will shortly be invited for the construction of the bridge. COAL AND WINE DUTIES. The Bill for the continuance of these duties which was reported upon fully in the last Report, has been again introduced into Parliament, and the Metropolitan Board of "Works fowarded to tlie Vestry a letter asking them to present a Petition to the House of Commons in favour of such Bill, but the Yestry resolved to take no action in the matter. CANTERBURY ROAD PAVING.-VESTRY V. STOTESBURY. In the last Annual Report it is reported that the Court of Queen's Bench had decided, in the Special Case of the Yestry v. Board of Works for the Greenwich District, that the Yestry could not recover the sum of £613, the cost of paving this road upon the Deptford side, but that the Vestry had power under the order of the Metropolitan Board of Works,which vested the management of Canterbury road in the Vestry, to recover the paving expenses from the owners of property, although such property was not in this Parish. The Vestry were consequently necessitated to make a new apportionment against tlie owners in this Parish, as also owners in Deptford Parish for the paving expenses of the road. In consequence of the decision (so clear and conclusive) that the Vestry had the legal right to charge the owners in Deptford Parish, a hope was expressed that the owners would not endeavour to escape payment by legal technicality, these hopes were unfortunately not realized, as one owner stated he intended to take advantage of every technical point. The demand made on Mr. Stotesbury not having been paid, a summons was issued in the Greenwich Police Court Lr £548 3s. 8d. 136 being the apportioned amount in respect of his property in the said road. Upon the hearing of the summons Mr. Austincounsel) represented the Yestry,and Mr. Geo. Lyon, Mr. Stotesbury and a technical objection was taken by his Counsel that the land of the Canal Company agreed by them to be given up for the purposes of the new bridge which "bounded" and "abutted" the present termination of the road, not having been assessed, the apportionment was bad, and the Magistrate, R. H. B. Marshanv Esq., dismissed the summons without costs upon this objection.. The Yestry on the 7th December ordered a fresh apportionment to be made in accordance with this decision, and the Yestry of the 21st December in making such apportionment resolved:—"That having regard to the decision of the Magistrate, that the land, which the Surrey Commercial Docks Company are the owners abutting the termination of the road, should be assessed, are of the opinion that inasmuch as the land would form part of theroadway leading to the bridge shortly to be constructed by theMetropolitan Board, and which will be given up by the Company to effect a great public improvement, that it is just and expedient to assess the land in a much less amount than the other owners." Mr. Stotesbury having refused payment of the fresh apportionment amounting to £548 3s. 8d. upon 28 houses and building land, a summons was issued against him returnable in the Greenwich Police Court before Mr.Marsham; on the hearing of this summons, Mr. J. V. Austin again appeared for the Yestry, andMr. George Lyon for the Defendant. The Defendant's Counsel' then took two objections, viz:— firstly, that the measurement was inaccurate, and secondly, that the Yestry had no legal power to assess the land of the Surrey Commercial Dock Compmy (being land which they had agreed to surrender to the Metropolitan Board of Works without compensation for the erection of the bridge) in a different sum to the Defendent's land, which is valuable building 137 land. The Magistrate made an order for the apportioned amount,, together with £3 3s. costs. Application was made to the Magistrate to state a Case for the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench,, which was granted. The Appeal was heard in the High Court of Justice, (Queen's Bench Division) before Mr. Justice Wills and Mr. Justice Grantham, sitting as a Divisionional Court. For the Appellant (Mr. Stotesbury), Mr. G. Lyon, Mr. Laing with him, for the Respondents (the Yestry) Mr. J. Y. Austin. Mr. Lyon in opening the case for the Appellant, argued that the Vestry could not apportion the expenses between the owners of land in the same street at different rates, and cited "Nesbitt v. Greenwich" (L.R. 10 Q.B.), "Wright v. Ingle" (L.R. 16 Q.B. 468) "Whitchurch v. Fulham" (L.R. 1 Q.B. 241), "London School Board v. Yestry of St. Mary, Islington'' (Q.B.D. 65.) Mr. Austin fo the Yestry,cited the case of "Chelsea v. Evans " (34 J.P. 23) and other cases. The Court held that the apportionment must be supported.. The earlier Act had not provided for any apportionment, or for any means of recovering the individual sums due for paving expenses. But under the 77th Section of the later Act 25 and 26 Vict., Cap. 102, the power of apportioning the total cost among the owners of lands and houses was thrown on the Vestry, though it did not contain any definite principle upon which they were to Act. The governing element of the Section was that the Vestry were the tribunal who were to decide how these costs were to be apportioned, and therefore neither the principle, nor the want of principle upon which the Vestry acted, could be inquired into by the Magistrate. The only principle that the Vestry had to follow, was that they were to act upon what they thought to be really just and fair. The case cited for the Vestry was very much in point. The power given in the section to rate lands at 138 a less sum than houses, was not to be taken to be a limitation of power, but only as an indication to the Vestry or their Surveyor, that, if thought "just and expedient" the difference between the two classes of property might be taken into consideration. The case of the "London School Board v. the Vestry of St. Mary, Islington" (L.R. 1 Q.B.D.), showed what vast powers the Vestry had, for their apportionment was supported in that case when the School Board, on a frontage of perhaps 20 feet, was assessed at nearly thirty times the amount of a neighbouring owner, whose frontage was over 180 feet. The Vestry had the power of apportioning such expenses, and the sooner this was realized the better. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs. Mr. Laing then applied for leave to appeal but this the Court refused. free libraries. At a Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 28th March, the following Letter was read from Mr. Livesey:— " South Metropolitan Gas Co., 709a, Old Kent Road, March 27th, 1888. Dear Mr. Marsden, I have been intimately connected for nearly fifty years (twenty-eight as a resident) with the Parish of Cambcrwell, particularly with the North Peckham Ward, where the Gas Works are situated, and am desirous of doing something that may be useiul to the inhabitants, especially the working people, and will add some enjoyment to their lives. After much consideration, I think a Free Public Library would best promote union amongst classes, and give the 139 people the means of spending their spare time pleasantly and profitably. With this object, I have secured a suitable site, Nos. 678, 680, and 682, Old Kent Road; the frontage is 48-ft., and the depth 150ft. If the Parish will take up the question I will give the site and provide a building for a Free Library in that locality. In so large a Parish three or four such libraries will probably be necessary, but one would certainly be wanted in the Old Kent Road. I think they should be founded by public subscriptions or private benefaction as is being done in Lambeth, when a rate of one halfpenny in the pound would probably be sufficient for their maintenance. I address this proposal to you as I think such a movement to be successful should be taken in hand by the Vestry, who will, I feel sure, do what is best for the Parish. I am, Yours faithfully, GEORGE LIVESEY. G. W. Marsden, Esq., Vestry Clerk." Moved by Mr. G. C. Whiteley, seconded and unanimously: Resolved.— That Mr. Livesey be informed by the Vestry Clerk that his very generous offer was received with much warmth and cordiality, to assure him that his proposal was thoroughly appreciated by all Members of the Vestry, 140 and to convey to him their best thanks for the valuable and useful gift he proposed to confer on the Parishioners. Moved by M0r. H. Rowley, seconded by Mr. W. E. Teather, and Resolved:—That the question be referred to a Special Committee consisting of three Members from each of the standing Committees. The following Members were then appointed to form such Special Committee, from the— Sewers and Sanitary Committee: Messrs. T. Foster, T. L. Lassam, and R. D. Winyard. General Purposes Committee. Messrs. A. Middlemass, J. Faulkner, and W. J. Hazel. Finance Committee: Messrs. G. C. Whiteley, M. Wallace, and H. Rowley. Plant and Scavenging Committee: Messrs. G. L. Turney, A. Madge, and A. Norman. Report of the Special Committee appointed by the Yestry to consider the letter of the 27th March last, from Mr. George Livesey, offering to provide a Free Library in the Old Kent Road, if the Vestry would take up the question of Free Libraries in this Parish. Your Committee desire to express their sense of the noble generosity of Mr. Livesey in proposing to give a Free Library to the Parish. They are of opinion that the proposed Gift should be used as an incentive to other possible donors, and also to 141 urge upon the Ratepayers generally the advisability of adopting the Free Libraries Act in the Parish of Camberwell. From enquiries made in Parishes where the Libraries Act has been adopted, your Committee have ascertained that the cost of providing a Library is about £5,000, and of maintaining the same £500 a year. Your Committee are of opinion that four Libraries would be required to accommodate the inhabitants of this extensive Parish. The sum of £20,000 would therefore be required to establish the Institutions, and about £2,000 a year for the maintenance of the same. Of the £20,000 required, the generous offer of Mr. Livesey may be taken to represent £5,000, which leaves £15,000 to be raised from other sources. Your Committee believe that the Rate collected under the Libraries Act should be used for the maintenance only of the Institutions, which would limit the necessary Rate to the maximum of a halfpenny in the pound, and increase the chance on appeal to the Ratepayers of carrying the proposals. Your Committee need not remind the Vestry of the great advantages to be gained by placing Free Libraries in different parts of this Parish. They strongly urge the Vestry to seize the present favourable opportunity of inviting other Parishioners to follow the example of Mr. Livesey, and to endeavour to bring about the adoption, by the Parish of Camberwell, of a measure which is likely to confer great benefits upon the community. 142 The Committee recommended:— 1. That Mr. Livesey's generous offer be accepted. 2. That an appeal be immediately made by this Vestry for aid in providing three additional Institutions. 3. That the necessary steps be taken to bring the Libraries Act into operation, the Kate not to exceed one halfpenny in the pound. 4. That your Committee be instructed to carry out the foregoing Resolutions. nomination of committees. The Vestry at a Meeting held on the 28th March, 1888, resolved, on the motion of Mr. R. D. Winyard, that the nomination of the Members of the Vestry to the different Standing Committees should be made by Wards, and that Meetings of the Members for each Ward should be summoned by the Vestry Clerk for the purpose of preparing such nominations. Such Meetings have this year been held, and the Committees elected by the Vestry upon such nominations. metropolitan board of works. On the 17th August last, the Vestry resolved that an humble Address should be presented to Her Most Gracious Majesty, praying that a Royal Commission be appointed to enquire into the alleged wrong doing of certain Officials and Members of the Metropolitan Board of Works in the administration of the affairs of that Board, and that all the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards should be invited to join in such Address, power was also given to the Law and Parliamentary Committee to settle the form of Address; at a Special Meeting of the Vestry held on the 30th August, 1888, the Seal was affixed to the following Address:— 143 "To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty; the humble loyal, and dutiful Address of the Members of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, in the County of Surrey. Most Gracious Sovereign, Your suppliants, by virtue of the existing Metropolis Local Management Acts, elect two representatives as part of the body known as the Metropolitan Board of "Works, consisting of 60 Members. All the other Members of the Metropolitan Board of Works except three are similarly elected by the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, pursuant to the statutes on that behalf, such three Members being elected by the Common Council of the City of London. The Metropolitan Board, not being directly elected by the people, owes no allegiance to any constituency, and cannot be assailed, except to the extent to which each Yestry or District Board can put pressure on the Members it elects. Your suppliants, speaking for themselves, and to the best of their belief, as to many other Metropolitan Yestries or District Boards, are under a sense of responsibility in respect of the Metropolitan Board and its administration. The scope of the Metropolis Local Management Acts enables the people to elect from themselves representatives, still clothed with the harness of their daily callings, to fulfil the duties of local self-government; and any failure by the Metropolitan Board or its officers to carry out its duties with the strictest integrity, soils the reputation of local self-government, and reflects with discredit, at least indirectly, upon all the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. It is unfortuuately common knowledge to all people of the Metropolis, and therefore unnecessary of proof, that an official of the Metropolitan Board, charged with important duties connected 144 with selling land belonging to the Metropolitan Board, became interested with the purchasers of such land; if indeed he was not himself, whilst acting for the Metropolitan Board—the sellers, already trafficking in the land as a purchaser. The whole matter seems to have been admitted before the Metropolitan Board; but, as appears to your suppliants, so low is that Board's sense of moral duty, that they merely passed the following resolution, condemning their officer and censuring his conduct, which censure has even yet not been administered. 'That this Board is of opinion that none of its officers should be interested in the financial success of any dealings with the Board's properties, and considers that Mr. Robertson's admitted financial connection with his brothers, under the assumed name of Grey, in such dealings, and especially the unauthorised substitution of one of his brothers for Mr. Foster, a tenant appointed by the Board, is most improper and deserving of censure.' Your suppliants are alarmed at the low moral tone of a public Board that could thus deal with so serious an offence of an official; and your suppliants are under fears that the Members of the Board, or an important number of them, may not be free agents towards their officials, but may have dealings of their own which they may not wish either to disclose or to have disclosed. The fears, alarms, and amazement of your suppliants have been greatly aggravated by the course the Metropolitan Board has taken upon these matters being challenged in the public Press. The judgment of your suppliants is, that there are a number of the Members of the Metropolitan Board who are endeavouring to hide something, or hush something up. That Board has refused to appoint a Special Committee to enquire into the facts, but has by a majority adopted the sham of appointing a Committee of the whole Board, the very effect of which is, to put the Members 145 of the Board into the position of being their own judges upon serious charges and accusations against them. So ill-balanced and ill-guided are some of the Members sitting on this Committee, that one of them proposed a criminal prosecution for libel against a person who had written a letter containing serious allegations against the Board, and who had declined to appear before such a Committee. The public Press, the people, a very large section of the Metropolitan Board itself, many of the Metropolitan Yestries and District Boards, together with your suppliants, believe that the Committee so appointed is wholly inadequate either for ascertaining the guilt of the parties accused, or for establishing the innocence of many Members and officials. Your suppliants believe that nothing short of a Royal Commission (with the mercy that Your Most Gracious Majesty finds the indulgence to accord to wrong doers, who truthfully disclose all the facts for the general benefit of the community) will have the result of unearthing and bringing to light the corruption which is charged against the Metropolitan Board of Works and its Officers, and of establishing the innocence of those now unjustly under the cloud of suspicion. Numerous persons have refused to give evidence before the Board's Committee, whilst they have expressed their willingness to appear before a Royal Commission. The importance of the enquiry will appear from a few figures. Last year, the Board received from about four millions of taxpayers, and a few other sources emanating from the people, the enormous sum of about £1,500,000. Since its incorporation, the Board has from time to time borrowed £36,000,000 of which about £30,000,000 is still owing. Putting the inhabitants of the United Kingdom at about 40,000,000 and the Imperial Budget at about £80,000,000 it 146 will be seen that Imperial taxation amounts to about £2 per head per annum. The Metropolitan Board taxed and otherwise received from the people last year at the rate of about 8s. per head, and did not decrease its loans. The Metropolitan Board has in three years spent £196,268 1s. 4d. in endeavouring to deodorise London Sewage, this expenditure being, according to an eminent expert, almost useless. Your suppliants in Common Vestry assembled on the 17th day of August, 1887, unanimously passed the following resolution:— Moved by Mr. Teather, seconded by Mr. Foskett, and Resolved:—'That an humble Address be presented to Her Most Gracious Majesty, praying that a Royal Commission be appointed to enquire into the alleged wrong doings of certain Officials and Members of the Metropolitan Board of Works, in the administration of the affairs of that Board, and that all other of the Metropolitan Vestries, and the District Boards, be invited to join in such Address.' Your suppliants in exercise of one of the dearest rights of Englishmen, and as representing upwards of two hundred thousands of your Most Gracious Majesty's loyal, dutiful, and loving subjects, approach your Most Gracious Majesty and throne direct, praying that for the protection of the innocent from numerous slanders, and for the searching out of the guilty if any there be, Your Most Gracious Majesty may be pleased to command that a Royal Commission be appointed, with all usual powers, to consider and enquire into the matters referred to in this most humble address, or arising out of the administration of the Metropolitan Board. Given under the Corporate Seal of the Yestry of St. Giles, Camberwell, in Vestry assembled this 30th day of August, 1887." 147 Copies of this Address were also sent to all the London Vestries and District Boards, asking for the same to be brought before their respective Boards. Replies were received from 39, of whom 19 agreed with Camberwell, 5 with the resolutions of the Paddington Vestry also in favor of a Royal Commission being appointed, 5 acknowledged the receipt, 8 who differed but recommended no action, and 2 have the matter still under consideration- On the 9th September, 1887, a letter was received from Godfrey Lushington, Esq., stating "that he had been directed by the Secretary of State to acquaint me, for the information of the Vestry, that he had laid before the Queen the Petition to Her Majesty forwarded in my letter of the 31st ult., praying Her Majesty to issue a Royal Commission of enquiry into certain matters connected with the administration of the Metropolitan Board of Works." On the 11th February, 1888, a letter was received from the Paddington Vestry, stating that that Vestry had unanimously resolved that the Right Honorable Lord Randolph Churchill, M.P., and Mr. John Aird, M.P. be requested to introduce a Bill into Parliament for the appointment of a Royal Commission. An Act of Parliament was moved for and obtained for the appointment of a Royal Commission by Lord Randolph Churchill, and the Commissioners appointed were Lord Herschell (Chairman) Mr. F. A. Bosanquet, Q.C., and Mr. H. C. Grenfell. The Commissioners have power to compel the attendance of witnesses, and any witness who refuses to answer any question put to him by the Court, would be liable to imprisonment. Witnesses who answer and make full disclosures will be entitled to a Certificate, which will relieve them from all actions at law or criminal proceedings; any witness not making a full disclosure will be liable to be proceeded against civilly or criminally, as such evidence may render him liable. The Commission held its first sitting on May 5th. 148 treasurer. The 62nd Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, enacts that the Vestry shall appoint a Treasurer (whose duty it is to keep the Account of the Vestry). Robert Ryrie, Esq., the then Chairman of the London and Joint Stock Bank, was appointed by the Vestry Treasurer, and the Accounts of the Vestry were kept in his name at the Southwark Branch. The London and South-Western Bank having now established two branches of their Bank in the Parish of Camberwell, one at High street, Peckham, and the other at Camberwell green, the Vestry considering these conveniences to the Ratepayers, and the advantages of a local Bank, took into their consideration the expediency of appointing a new Treasurer, and whilst recognising and thanking Robert Ryrie, Esq., for the attention the London and Joint Stock Bank had given to the Account, stated that they felt it their duty to avail themselves of the convenience of a local Bank, and thereupon appointed Sir George R. Prescott, Bart. (one of the Directors of the London and South-Western Bank), Treasurer. The Bank purchased £15,000 in the names of the Trustees as a security for the due performance of the office of Treasurer. The Vestry appointed Geo. Crispe Whiteley and the Vestry Clerk as Trustees on behalf of the Vestry, and the Bank appointed two Trustees on their behalf. The Account has accordingly been transferred from the London and Joint Stock Bank to the London and South-Western Bank. An unanimous vote of thanks was passed by the Vestry, to the Treasurer, Manager, and Officers of the London Joint Stock Bank for their attention to the Vestry Accounts. personal. Death of Mr. J. O.Wilson. On the 1st February last, the Chairman reported to the Vestry the death of Mr. J. O. Wilson, whereupon the following resolution was unanimously passed:— 149 That the Vestry receive with deep regret, the intelligence of the death of Mr. John Osborn Wilson, who was a Member of this Vestry for the last 21 years, during which time he filled for 3 years the important office of Overseer of the Poor of the Parish, and was chosen Chairman of the Sewers and Sanitary Committee for two successive years, all of which appointments he filled with credit to himself and to the great advantage of his fellow Parishioners. His devotion to the interests of the Parish, his upright conduct and kindness of heart, obtained for him the respect and esteem of his colleagues. This Vestry now offer their condolence with his family in their heavy bereavement and irreparable loss. 1887-8 8.

Dated this 28th day of May, 1888, and continued by adjournment until the 25th day of July, 1888.

Report of the Auditors to the Vestry respecting the Accounts for the Year ending March 25th, 1888. Vestry Hall, Camberwell, S.E. July 25th, 1888. Gentlemen, We, being the duly appointed Auditors of the Parish, have in accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1885, examined and audited the Books of Accounts with the Vouchers relating thereto for the period from the 26th March, 1887, to the 25th March, 1888, both dates inclusive, and submit the following repoit thereon. Having gone minutely into the Vestry General Accounts we find them perfectly correct, and sign the same in satisfaction thereof. With respect to the Burial Board's Accounts, we have to report that such of the accounts as are kept at the office are in perfect order. We regret however to say that we found irregularities in the matters under the control of Cemetery Superintendent Flatley, and especially as to the issue of Burial Certificates and the safe custody of the books, which caused us to put ourselves into communication with the Board. The Members met us, and heartily assisted us in investigating the matter. 196 We have much pleasure in stating that what seems a verythorough system of cheeking the accounts has now been inaugurated, and in assurance thereof we do allow and sign the accounts. At the same time, we would suggest that as much of the clerical work as possible, and particularly as regards cash transactions should be done at the office of the Board. In the Charities Accounts, we have to report a similar circumstance to that stated in the report of our immediate predecessors one of the Distributors (Mr. Bellis) has furnished no receipts or statement of the disbursement of money placed in his hands for distribution. From what information we could gather, we are satisfied that the Annuitants have been paid, but the sum of £11 0s 0d. of the Samaritan Gift has not been distributed. We notice that in several instances the recipients of the Samaritan Gift have received from more than one Distributor, and we think that care should be taken to spread the benefit as widely as possible. In conclusion we beg to acknowledge the courtesy of the Clerks who have attended upon us during the Audit, and to express our entire satisfaction with and approval of the business like manner in which the accounts of the various departments are kept.
