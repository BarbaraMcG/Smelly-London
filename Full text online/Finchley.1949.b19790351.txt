The most notable feature in the vital statistics is that the Infantile Mortality Rate was 19.3 per 1,000 live births which is a new low record for the Borough. There was a continued upward trend in the General Death Rate in spite of the saving in child life, but this is what must be expected in an ageing population. 65% of the total deaths were of persons over 65 years of age. The decline in the birth rate continued. The position regarding Infectious Diseases was good except in the case of Poliomyelitis. There were 26 confirmed cases during the summer and autumn months and three of them were fatal. There was no death from Measles, Whooping Cough, Scarlet Fever, Enteric Fever or Cerebro Spinal Fever. There has not been a case of Diphtheria since August, 1946. I regret to have to say that as forecast in last year's report there has been an increase in the number of new cases of and deaths from Tuberculosis. There has been little change in housing conditions ; overcrowding is almost as great a problem as ever, and the condition of much of the older property has continued to deteriorate as the result of a combination of circumstances, including over-occupation due to sub-letting, the high cost of repairs and redecorations, high rates and taxes and the comparatively low rents of controlled houses. 3 The Sanitary Inspectors have given much of their time to visiting food premises and by co-operation with owners have effected many sanitary improvements in the buildings. They have also aroused considerable interest among the employees at all levels in the cleaner production and handling of food. I have included certain information regarding the services now administered by the County Council. I wish to thank all members of the staff for their loyal and conscientious service throughout the year. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. A. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,477 Population, 1949 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 72,080 Number of Inhabited Houses (1949) 19,426 Rateable Value (1949) £913,008 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,710 Total Live Births 981 Birth Rate per 1,000 civilian population 13.9 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England & Wales) 16.7 Total Stillbirths 20 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 20.0 Total Deaths 834 Death Rate per 1,000 civilian population 11.8 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England & Wales) 11.7 Infant Deaths 19 Infant Mortality Rate 19.3 Infant Mortality Rate (England & Wales) 32 Maternal Deaths 1 Maternal Mortality Rate 1.0 Maternal Mortality Rate (England & Wales) 0.98 Live Births: Males Females Total Legitimate 516 427 943 Illegitimate 22 16 38 538 443 981 Birth rate 13.9 per 1,000 estimated civilian population.

Deaths from disease and accidents of pregnancy and childbirth: From Sepsis - Other maternal causes 1 5 Death Rate of infants under one year of age: All infants per 1,000 live births 19.3 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 20.1 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births — Deaths from Cancer (all ages) 169 Deaths from Measles (all ages) — Deaths from Whooping Cough (all ages) — Deaths from Diarrhoea (under 2 years of age) 2 Population The Registrar-General has estimated the total population to be 72,080 which is 1,120 more than in 1948. He has also estimated the civilian population to be 70,760. Births There were 981 registered live births in 1949, as compared with 1,086 in the previous year while the birth rate was 13.9 as compared with 15.3. The rate for England and Wales was 16.7. Stillbirths There were 20 stillbirths in 1949 giving a rate of 0.28 per 1,000 of the civilian population. The rate for England and Wales was 0.39 per 1,000 total population. Infantile Mortality There were only 19 deaths of infants under one year of age, giving an infantile mortality rate of 19.3 per 1,000 live births which is a new low record for the Borough. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 32. 6 7 BIRTH AND DEATH RATES FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS Maternal Mortality One mother died in 1949 giving a maternal mortality rate of 1 per 1,000 births. The rate for England and Wales was 0.98. Deaths There were 834 deaths in 1949, 71 more than in 1948 when the number was particularly low, namely 763, which was 67 less than in 1947. There were 30 more deaths from cancer and 23 more from diseases of the heart and blood vessels than in 1948. There were 59 more deaths of persons over 65 years of age than in 1948. The crude death rate was 11.8 and the standardised death rate was 10.97. The rate for England and Wales was 11.7. Each district is allotted a comparability figure by the Registrar General which varies according to the age and sex constitution of the population as compared with those of England and Wales as a whole. The average age of the population of Finchley is considerably higher than that of the Country as a whole and as there are inevitably more deaths per 1,000 in an older population than in a younger one Finchley is allotted a comparability figure of 0.93 by which the crude death rate is multiplied in order to obtain the standardised death rate. The difference in the sex constitution of the population of Finchley from that of England and Wales is too slight to have any appreciable effect on the death rate. Mortuary Ninety-nine bodies were received into the Mortuary, and 29 of these were from Friern Barnet. 9 INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1949 Deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year of age CAUSE OF DEATH Under 1 week 1-2 weeks 2-3 weeks 3-4 weeks Total under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 3 months 3-6 months 6-9 months 9-12 months TOTAL WARDS N E w All Causes Certified 9 1 10 3 4 19 8 3 8 Uncertified Smallpox Chicken Pox Measles Scarlet Fever Whooping Cough Diphtheria & Croup Erysipelas Tuberculous Meningitis Meningitis (not Tuberculous) Convulsions Laryngitis Bronchitis Pneumonia (all forms) 1 1 2 2 Diarrhoea 1 1 2 1 1 Enteritis Gastritis Syphilis Rickets Suffocation, Overlying Injury at Birth Atelectasis 3 3 3 2 1 Congenital Malformations 2 2 2 1 5 3 1 1 Premature Birth 3 3 3 1 2 Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus Other causes 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 TOTALS 9 . 1 10 3 4 2 19 8 3 8 10 11 12 INFANT DEATH AND NEO-NATAL DEATH RATES FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS INFANT DETH RATE NEO-NATAL DEATH RATE TABLE I CAUSES OF, AND AGES AT DEATH DURING THE YEAR, 1949 No. CAUSES OF DEATH NET DEATHS AT THE SUBJOINED AGES OF 'RESIDENTS" WHETHER OCCURRING WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE DISTRICT Total Deaths whether of "Residents" or "Nonresidents" in Institutions in the District WARDS All Causes Certified All Ages Under 1 and under 2 2 and under 5 5 and under 15 15 and under 25 25 and under 45 45 and under 65 65 and upwards North Ward East Ward West Ward Uncertified 1.

Scarlet Fever There were 124 cases of Scarlet Fever, exactly twice as many as in the previous year. This increase was expected and fits in with the established periodicity of this disease. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of- others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. 16 INCIDENCE OF DIPHTHERIA FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS 17 18 Poliomyelitis 1949 was an epidemic year for this disease and Finchley had its full share with 26 confirmed cases. There were 14 males and 12 females and their ages ranged from 1 year to 38 years. Ca^es started to occur in July and continued until the end of the year. There were 3 cases in one family and 2 in another, but apart from these there was no evidence of any common source of infection. There were 3 fatal cases, two healthy and active young men both of whom appeared to have contracted the disease on the Continent, and a school girl aged 11. Most of the others made excellent recoveries but a few are still under treatment at the Orthopaedic Clinic for residual paralysis. Measles There were 381 cases of measles—less than half the number notified in 1948, and there were no fatal cases. Whooping Cough This disease was less prevalent than in 1948 and caused no deaths. 9 Pneumonia Sixty-five cases were notified in 1949 and there were 30 deaths, 25 of which were in persons over 65 years of age. Miscellaneous There was one case of Cerebro-Spinal Fever but none of Smallpox or Enteric Fever. 19 Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1949. Positive Negative Throat/Nose Swabs Diphtheria Bacilli - 270 Hæmolytic Streptococci . 115 Vincent's Angina 5 Fæces Sonne Dysentery 3 57 Salmonella 2 Protozoa 3 Sputum T.B. Smear 5 82 Other Organisms 7 Whooping Cough Cough Plate -\ 6 Post-nasal Swab 3 143 415 Tuberculosis Seventy-eight cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified in 1949 as compared with 63 in 1948, and 6 non-pulmonary as compared with 9 in the previous year. Deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis increased from 12 in 1948 to 18 in 1949 while the deaths from non-pulmonary remained the same. Owing to the shortage of sanatorium beds many patients have to be nursed at home, frequently under unsatisfactory conditions, which not only militate against their chance of recovery but also add considerably to the chance of the infection being conveyed to others. 20 21 22 TUBERCULOSIS (Alt Forms) CASE RATE DEATH RATE The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years: Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F 1940 28 21 4 4 16 10 2 2 1941 34 38 5 7 18 15 2 1 1942 40 39 4 3 14 19 1 1 1943 41 39 7 5 14 11 3 5 1944 48 30 8 8 14 9 3 2 1945 49 41 8 1 17 9 5 1 1946 43 26 2 8 14 9 1 9 1947 54 36 1 4 18 9 2 - 1948 37 26 4 5 5 7 3 2 1949 41 37 2 4 10 8 1 4 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year 1949: Housing Statistics 1. Inspection of Dwelling-houses: (1) (a) Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 1,229 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 5,704 (2) (a) Number of dwelling-houses (included under sub-head (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 — (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose — 23 (3) Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 5 (4) Number of dwelling-houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 775 2. Remedy of defects during the year without service of formal notices: Number of defective dwelling-houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their officers 763 3. Action under Statutory Powers during the year: A. Proceedings under Section 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs 15 (2) Number of dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices: (a) By owners 15 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners — B. Proceedings under Public Health Acts : (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 15 (2) Number rendered fit: (a) By owners 7 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners 4 C. Proceedings under Sections 11 and 13 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwellng-houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made — (2) Number of dwelling-houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders — 24 Overcrowding Number of families known to be statutorily overcrowded on the 1st January, 1949 159 New cases recorded during 1949 65 Number abated 70 Number outstanding on the 31st December, 1949 154 Three hundred and eighty-four visits were made to inspect the accommodation occupied by applicants for re-housing and all information likely to be of value in determining the relative priority of these families was passed on to the Housing Department. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation 2 Granville Road, N.12 An application was made to the County Court to rescind a Demolition Order made in connection with this house, because the owner had given an undertaking to carry out the works necessary to render the house fit. The application was granted and the Order was quashed on payment of £4 4s. costs to the Council. The house was rendered fit. 357 Regents Park Road, N.3 In 1948 the part of these premises which was used for human habitation was represented as being unfit. A Closing Order was made, the tenant found other accommodation and the owner undertook not to re-let the premises for human habitation. 54 Alexandra Grove, N.12 The basement flat of this house was found to be incapable of repair at reasonable cost, and a Closing Order was served upon the owner. The flat was occupied by two families comprising four adults and seven children. Difficulty was experienced in finding alternative accommodation for the occupants and at the end of the year the notices to quit served upon the occupiers had not been complied with. 25 1175 High Road. N.20, and 3 Dollis Road, N.3 These houses, which were vacant, were found to be unfit for habitation but as the result of consultations with the owners, they agreed to make them fit and both houses have been re-occupied. 1192a and 1192c High Road, N.20 The above old dwellings, which were unoccupied, were found to be in a dangerous condition. Representations were made to the owner, who demolished the premises. Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 15,097. At 870 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 3,126 were discovered, and at the end of the year 3,590 including a number outstanding at the end of 1948 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 266 was in hand and 1,715 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied 1,655 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The difficulty of getting sanitary defects remedied is still increasing. The rents of controlled dwellings remain stationary, but the cost of repairs continues to rise with the result that the amount of money required to render a house fit is out of all proportion to its value. This is a very serious state of affairs for which it is difficult to suggest a remedy. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out: Inspections under Housing Acts 23 Special Inspections 3,333 Reinspections 2,959 Inspections of Works in Progress 1,655 Inspections of Factories, Workshops and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 464 Visits to Slaughterhouses 9 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 30 26 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 125 Inspections of Meat, Fish and other Food Shops 522 Inspections of Shops (Shops Acts) 169 Visits re Infectious Disease and Verminous Premises 760 Visits re Rodent Control 3,688 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 384 Visits re Building Licences 17 Visits re Hawkers 165 Visits to Hairdressers Premises 46 Visits to Houses let in lodgings 42 Miscellaneous 706 15,097 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Number of houses and premises re-drained 7 Repairs or amendments to existing drains 62 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 308 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 804 Manholes provided 47 Manholes repaired 17 Manhole covers provided 43 Intercepting traps fixed 3 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 33 New gully traps fixed 98 Gully curbs provided or repaired 10 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 7 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 18 Water tests applied 167 Smoke tests applied 10 Air tests applied 7 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C.

The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Disinfection and Disinffstation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 223 Number of articles disinfected 2,221 Number of verminous premises dealt with 44 Verminous rooms disinfested 98 Seven hundred and sixty visits were made by the inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. There was a further decrease in the number of houses found to be infested with bugs. In 1945 I commented as follows—"With the introduction of new insecticides, D.D.T. and Gammexane it is hoped that the nuisance from vermin and various insect pests will show a decrease in the future as the residual effects of these chemicals should go a long way to bring about an initial cure and prevent re-infestation". The following table shows the position 29 over the past eleven years from which it will be seen there was a progressive increase in the number of cases during the war years, and a steady decline from 1944. 1939 41 premises 1940 35 1941 49 1942 52 1943 58 1944 76 1945 52 1946 39 1947 40 1948 36 1949 24 Only one case of fleas was dealt with as against three the previous year. A decrease in the number of houses infested with ants has also occurred during the year, in spite of the hot dry summer. 7 cases having been dealt with as against 16 in 1948. Six cases of infestation by cockroaches were dealt with during the year. Infestation by the furniture beetle (Anobium punctatum) has -been more pronounced in post war years, and is causing some concern as this insect seriously damages furniture and woodwork and is difficult to eradicate. Houses Let in Lodgings During the year no additions were made to the Register of Houses let in lodgings. The number of registered premises in the Borough is now 76 Common Lodging Houses There are no common lodging houses in the Borough. Sanitary Conveniences There are 24 conveniences attached to licensed houses withir the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. 30 There are 13 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in Recreation Grounds. Twelve of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and 1 accommodation for males only. One new convenience, providing accommodation for both sexes was built during the year. Complaints One thousand six hundred and sixty-three complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz.: Blocked or defective drains 177 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 453 Defective roofs 138 Non-removal of refuse 9 Verminous condition of houses 7 Nuisances from dampness 44 Overcrowding 163 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 20 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 8 Accumulations of refuse or manure 45 Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 19 Smoke nuisances 8 Premises infested with rats, mice, etc. 387 Premises infested with insects 41 Flooding 9 Noise 6 Nuisances from pig bins 7 Water Supply 7 Unsound Food 29 Foreign matter in food 6 Dirty milk bottles 3 Other complaints 72 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of complaint. 31 Places of Public Entertainment The cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. The defects discovered as a result of these inspections were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible. Eighteen premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council, which is the licensing authority. Factory Act, 1937 1.

Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared has received the special attention of the sanitary inspectors. 34 There has been a substantial increase in the hawking or foodstuffs, especially fruit and vegetables, and 24 new registrations were granted during the year. Many of the new hawkers are "barrow boys" and live outside the Borough. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked up where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. In two cases registration was refused in connection with the proposed sale of fried fish and winkles. Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, reads as follows : "16—(1) Every dealer in ice-cream who in a street or other place of public resort sells, or offers or exposes for sale, ice-cream from a stall, or from a cart, barrow or other vehicle, or from a basket, pail, tray or other container, used without a stall or vehicle, shall have his name and address legibly and conspicuously •displayed on the stall, vehicle or container, as the case may be, and, if he fails to comply with the requirements of this section, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. "(2) A local authority may at any time resolve that, as from such date, not being less than four weeks from the passing of the resolution, as may be specified therein and until the resolution is revoked, this section shall apply within their district in relation to all kinds of food, or to any kinds of food specified in the resolution, as it applies in relation to ice-cream, and while any such resolution is in force, this section shall apply accordingly". The Council passed the necessary resolution and the above section as applied to all kinds of food came into operation on the 1st July. As will be seen under the heading "Legal Proceedings" a large number of street traders were prosecuted for not complying with the section. Eight hundred and eighty-nine visits were made to various food premises and improvements have been carried out in a number of cases. 35 The list of condemned food is shown below: Carcases Inspected and Condemned Cattle excluding cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed - — — — 91 Number inspected - — - — 91 All diseases except Tuberculosis : Whole carcases condemned — — — — — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 2 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis - - - - 2.2 Tuberculosis only : Whole carcases condemned — ' — — - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 1 Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis - - - - 1.1 36 UNSOUND FOOD, 1949 Tuberculosis Swine 1 Pig's Head Other Diseases Bovines 8 lbs.

In none of the cases was the causative organism isolated, nor were the responsible articles of food identified. Slaughterhouses The number of licensed slaughterhouses in the district has now been reduced from four to two. At the commencement of the year, when re-licensing was being dealt with, two of the premises were considered to be unsuitable and were not recommended for licensing. There was no appeal from the occupiers. Occasional slaughtering is carried out at the remaining slaughterhouses on permit from the Food Office. Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, all animals, including sheep, slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. The number of persons licensed under the Act during 1949 was 3. 39 Butchers' Shops There are 48 butchers' shops in the Borough. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. These premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 30. At 25 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. In one case legal proceedings were pending with regard to the unsatisfactory conditions. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops New legislation which came into force during the year had the effect of reducing the powers of the Council. Sterilised milk is now a designated milk and the licensing of the plants for processing sterilised and pasteurised milks and the sale of milk therefrom is a duty now imposed upon the Food and Drugs Authority (the County Council) instead of the Local Council and the registration of dairy farms and dairy farmers passes to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The alteration of the definition "dairy" now excludes shops from which milk is supplied only in properly closed, and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or a shop or other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. The result of this amendment has reduced the number of registered premises from 25 to 9. Fees for licences to sell designated milks were abolished under the new legislation but the number of licences granted substantially increased. 40 The Milk (Special Designations) Regulations Licenses were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1949, as follows: — Dealers' licenses to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 14 „ „ „ Pasteurised 14 „ „ „ Sterilised 18 Supplementary licenses to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 7 „ „ „ Pasteurised 3 „ „ „ „ Sterilised 7 Licence in respect of establishment at which Tuberculin Tested milk is bottled 1 Licences in respect of establishments in which the process of pasteurising milk is carried on 2 Seven samples of Tuberculin Tested and six of Pasteurised milk were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination. With three exceptions these samples complied with the prescribed conditions. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only two persons make ice cream within the Borough, and both employ the method known as "complete cold mix" which only requires the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 86 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Nine samples were taken during the year. Coffee Stalls The number of coffee stalls in the Borough is two. Both are situated on the main roads. They are visited at intervals and action is taken to secure the provision of a satisfactory water supply, suitable means of food storage, cleanliness of stalls and utensils and proper means for the storage and disposal of refuse. 41 Fish Friers This business is established at 8 premises. One new shop was opened during the year. The proprietor co-operated with the department and a first class restaurant and kitchen were fitted up. Game Licences Twenty-five applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. The Shops Acts, 1912-1936 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to the shops on the Register are as follows: Number on register at beginning of 1949 866 Number closed 8 New shops 43 No. on register at end of 1949 901 Changes of occupancy 45 Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances: (1) Fourteen street traders were summonsed for 49 offences including 22 cases of failure to register as hawkers under Section 279 of the Middlesex County Council Act and 27 instances of failure to exhibit names and addresses as required by Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Two summonses were dismissed and in the other cases fines amounting to £20 and costs totalling £1-1-0 were imposed. (2) (a) An owner was summonsed for failing to abate a nuisance arising from a defective roof and range. The defendant asserted that under the terms of the lease of the tenancy he was not responsible for the maintenance of the premises. The magistrates dismissed the summons. (b) An owner was summonsed for failing to abate a nuisance arising from defective roofs. An order was made to abate the nuisance within six weeks. 42 (3) Legal proceedings were taken against a firm for the sale of milk from a dirty bottle. The defendants pleaded guilty and were fined £5 and £10-10-0 costs. Swimming Pools In co-operation with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor samples of the water in all three pools were taken at intervals throughout the summer months. Additional samples were taken during hot spells when the pools were exceptionally busy. On all occasions the bacteriological reports on these samples were entirely satisfactory. When Infantile Paralysis was prevalent in the Borough I was frequently asked by anxious parents if I considered it safe for their children to use the swimming pools and I was glad to be able to assure them that there was no risk of infection being conveyed by the bath water. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and in quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of reports on 6 samples which were taken by the Company during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In all cases the results were very satisfactory. Samples of water taken from an uncovered storage cistern at a Fire Station following an outbreack of illness among the personnel were submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination with satisfactory results. A sample was also taken from a newly-constructed private dwelling following a complaint of discolouration suspected to be due to the use of copper water pipes. It was submitted for chemical examination and the analysis showed the water to be quite wholesome and safe for drinking and domestic purposes with only an extremely faint trace of copper. After the house had been occupied 43 for a few weeks the discolouration ceased and no further complaint has been received All dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses with the exception of 10 houses serving a population of 27 which are served by standpipes. Burial of the Dead Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948 reads as follows: "It shall be the duty of every authority to which the above section applies to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, in any case where it appears to the Authority that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made otherwise than by the Authority. An Authority may recover from the estate of the deceased person or from any person who for the purposes of this Act was liable to maintain the deceased person immediately before his death expenses incurred for burial". One such burial was carried out during the year and the funeral expenses recovered. RODENT CONTROL During the year 387 complaints were received, made up as follows: Confirmed Not confirmed Total Rats 153 73 226 Mice 97 17 114 Wasps 44 — 44 Bees 1 — 1 Foxes 2 — 2 297 90 387 44 All complaints of foxes are referred to the Pest Officer of the Middlesex County Council. Rats, of which no complaints had been received, were found at 90 premises. Rats were found in and around places where poultry was kept in 93 cases, which represent 38.3% of the infestations. rats mice wasps beesp Complaints 153 97 44 1 Visits 2,934 653 95 6 Prebaits 4,070 — — — Zinc Phosphide P 0 1 S o N s 769 97 — — Arsenic 71 — — — Red Squills 53 — — — A.N.T.U 4 — — — Gassing 38 — 49 1 Fifteen smoke tests were applied to rat holes which revealed defects in drainage at 4 premises. Sewers Maintenance treatments were carried out to the sewers during the months of May and November and this continued surveillance and treatment of the sewers is reflected in the reduced number of rats per surface infestation. The Rodent Operative, Mr. Taylor, left the employment of the Council on the 23rd May, 1949, and Mr. Gower commenced duties in his stead on the 13th June, 1949. 45 HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTERED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL (A) MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE Infant Welfare Centres There are 4 Infant Welfare Centres at which 10 sessions are held weekly.

The homes are visited by the Health Visitors and reports are furnished on their suitability for the reception and care of a child. Child Life Protection At the end of the year there were 15 foster parents and 17 foster children on the register. These were visited throughout the year by the Health Visitors who act as Child Life Protection Visitors. Day Nurseries There are three day nurseries providing 140 places. There was a long waiting list at each nursery. The health of the children was exceptionally good throughout the year. Domestic Helps The demand for helps has always been much in excess of the supply. At the end of the year the equivalent of 12 whole, time helps were employed and help was provided in 298 households during the year. Orthopedic Clinic During 1949, 40 children received treatment at this clinic, and made 296 attendances. 49 Diphtheria Immunisation The following table shows the number of children immunised against Diphtheria during the past three years : Children immunised 1947 1948 1949 Under 1 year 28 223 413 1—2 years 740 800 366 2—3 years 75 52 109 3—4 years 24 33 42 4—5 years 14 17 23 5—6 years 20 18 8 6—7 years 8 8 6 7—8 years 3 4 4 8—9 years 9 1 6 9—10 years 13 1 - 10—11 years 21 2 2 . 11—12 years 8 1 1 12—13 years 15 2 - • 13—14 years 6 1 - 14—15 years 6 — — 15 years and over 6 — 2 996 1,163 982 The figures for 1949 include 373 children who were immunised by private doctors.
