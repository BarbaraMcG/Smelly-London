WILKINSON, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., M.R.C.S., L A.C., Medical Officcr of Health for the lewisham District; Mcdical Officer to North Surrey District School; Surgeon P Division of Police. Gentlemen, As enacted by the 43rd section of the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1862, the duty devolves upon me to present you with a report upon the sanitary state of the Lewisham District during the year ending December, 1867. In presenting this report it is first necessary to ascertain the population of the district (Table No. 1.), which I have estimated in the same way as last year, i.e., by ascertaining from the several rate collectors the number of inhabited houses as near the middle of the year as possible, and taking the same average number of persons per house as were found to be resident at the census of 1861. From this estimated population, which is no doubt calculated upon a reliable basis, and which method of calculation has the approval of the Registrar General, the average mortality per 1,000 is calculated. I have, however, given in another column the population estimated logarithmally, supposing that the same rate of increase had gone on up to the middle of 1867 as was found to prevail between 1851 and 1861. 9 TABLE I. 1867.

"During the year 1867 the mortality of the whole of the Metropolis amounted to 70,588. Of these deaths, zymotic diseases were fatal in 15,027 cases, or more than one-fifth part of the whole. This aggregate result was however considerably less than it had been in any previous year since 1860. "The rate of mortality was 22.98 per 1,000. "The following table, No. 2, compiled from the Registrar General's Summary of Weekly Returns for 1867, gives the population of the Metropolis and 12 other large towns, together with the rate of mortality. 10 TABLE II.

"The Central group, which includes St. Giles's, Strand, Holborn, Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, East and West London, and City, suffers a mortality of 2.433 per cent. " The Eastern division, comprising Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, St. George's-in-the-East, Stepney, Mile End Old Town, and Poplar, had a death rate almost the same, viz., 2.423. "In the Northern group, Marylebone, Hampstead, Pancras, Islington, and Hackney, it was decidedly less, being 2.319. "The Western division, which includes Kensington, Chelsea, St. George's, Hanover Square, Westminster, St. Martin's-inthe-Fields, and St. James's, Westminster, was in the four years, 1863—6, the healthiest of all the five divisions; but last year its death rate was in excess, though only in the slightest degree, of that which prevailed in the South districts. In the West, the rate was 2.202; in the South, 2.198 per 100. "This last (South) division, stretching on the Surrey side of the river from its western limit at Putney to Greenwich and 11 Woolwich, in Kent, has an area about six times as great as the East and Central divisions together, but a population which does not equal that of these two divisions combined. "In it there is still abundance of uncovered ground; there are also compact masses of population, chiefly where Lambeth, St. George's, Southwark, St. Saviour's, St. Olave's, Bermondsey, and Newington lie, within the northward sweep of the river. Wandsworth, Owberwell, Rotherhithe, Greenwich, and Lewisham complete the South division. "A review of the tables apparently justifies the observation, that in none of the London divisions are the signs of sanitary improvement more legible than in this extensive Southern section."—[Registrar General.] In table No. 3, I give you the estimated population of Hampstead, calculated logarithmally, with the number of deaths and the rate of mortality per 1,000 during the year 1867. Hampstead is a district which may bo considered as more analogous to our own than any other of the Metropolitan districts, and it is one in which the average rate of mortality per 1000 was a little less than our own in the ten years between 1801 and 1861.

The following table gives the total mortality for the previous eleven years. TABLE V. 1856 1857 1858 1859 ! 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 345 375 409 433 455 405 497 533 598 552 674 But although in eleven years the population has no doubt doubled, we do not find that the mortality has increased in the same ratio. The mortality for the year 1867 is considerably less than that of 1866, although this district (no doubt in a great measure owing to the careful sanitary measures carried out by order of the Board of Works), was not materially affected by the then cholera epidemic, only ten deaths having occurred from cholera and eleven from diarrhœa during the year 1866, some of these having been communicated from infected districts. The mortality tables (Table No. 6) appended gives a detailed account of the canses of death and the different ages when death took place in the district. From these tables it may be perceived that 136 (or rather more than one-fifth) died of zymotic disease, out of which 13 14 died of small-pox. 3 „ measles. 9 „ scarlet fever. 8 „ diptheria. 8 „ croup. 16 „ whooping cough. 26 „ fever. 2 „ erysipelas. 1 „ carbuncle. 2 „ influenza. 26 „ diarrhœa. 2 „ rheumatism. 1 „ pyœmia. 112 deaths took place from constitutional disease, out of which 65 died of consumption of the lungs. 25 „ other tubercular diseases. 265 deaths took place from local diseases affecting the brain, lungs, heart, intestines, &c., out of which 78 died of diseases of the brain. 39 „ diseases of the organs of circulation. 94 „ diseases of the respiratory organs. 36 „ diseases of the organs of digestion. 11 „ diseases of the urinary organs. 104 died of developmental diseases, principally affecting the very young. 11 died violent deaths. 8 died from causes not ascertained or not specified. 207 deaths took place under 1 year. 85 above 1 and under 10 years. 18 „ 10 „ 20 „ 85 „ 20 „ 40 „ 92 „ 40 „ 60 „ 122 „ 60 „ 80 „ 27 80 and upwards. 636 14 In reviewing these statistics, one cannot be otherwise than struck at the low mortality during the past year; in some parts it has been specially marked, whilst its proportion to other districts affords cause for congratulation. But whilst we have every cause for thankfulness at the improvement of the district so far, yet it must be remembered that nearly one-fifth of the mortality has been occasioned by preventable disease; we show only a slightly less proportional mortality from this cause than the Metropolitan rate this year. But this district is rendered by nature healthy; it is bounded by open country ; its surface is of an undulating character, and affords the greatest facilities for perfect drainage; and it is in most parts considerably elevated. Therefore, as a result of all these natural advantages, we should be able to show a less proportionate mortality from this particular class of disease; which is well known and accepted to be most under the control of sanitary science. In August, 1866, "The Sanitary Act" (29 and 30 Victoria, chap. 30), was passed, an Act which conferred additional power upon District Boards. The Act is partly compulsory and partly permissive. Of the permissive part of the Act, the 35th clause, the Board has not yet availed itself. This provides that in parishes or districts included within the Act for the better Local Government of the Metropolis, the Secretary of State, upon application of the nuisance authority (the District Board), may empower them to make regulations as to the following matters, viz.:— 1. For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by more than one family. 2. For the registration of houses thus occupied or let in lodgings. 3. For the inspection of such houses and the keeping the same in a wholesome and cleanly state. 4. For affording privy accommodation, and other appliances and means of cleanliness in proportino to the number of lodgings and occupiers, and the cleansing and ventilation of the common passages and staircases. 15 5. For the cleansing and lime-whiting at stated times of such premises. The nuisance authorities may enforce these regulations by penalties not exceeding 40s. for any one offence, with the additional penalty of 20s. for every day during which a default in obeying such regulation shall continue. As each adult person requires for the preservation of health some 500 cubic feet of air space in a sleeping apartment, and without a sufficient supply of air he is breathing over again an impure and poisoned atmosphere, which is certain to be deleterious, it is important that some limit should be placed upon the number of persons inhabiting houses, and their overcrowding prevented. But difficulties attend this subject. In this district rents are expensive, and although it may be perfectly evident that a certain quantity of pure air is necessary for each individual; yet, it is patent to every one conversant with the house accommodation of the poor, that some families live, cook, eat, drink, wash (frequently dry clothing), and sleep in a room with a smaller air space than above mentioned; and that, if in all cases a sufficient air space were insisted on, some would find it difficult to find a residence. Still it is not of the less importance that we should endeavour as far as possible to insist upon sufficient air space, and ventilation, otherwise disease and mortality will occur. The subject of ventilation, however, requires less delicacy in handling, as whatever the kind of accommodation rooms afford, still they may be ventilated, and a small quantity of cubic space well ventilated is better than a much larger space without such ventilation. Ventilators should be fixed in every room, passage, or stairease, and these ventilators should be constant objects for examination by the inspector who visits, to see that they are in good working order. With regard to the registration of houses let or occupied in lodgings, a registered list, kept at the office oi the Loard of Works, of such houses, with a measurement of their cubic contents, would much facilitate their inspection, and enable 16 the inspector to see at once where illegal overcrowding existed ; and it would enable the local authority to take measures to remedy such evils and to see that proper accommodation be provided. But it would be first necessary to have a survey made of all such dwellings as are in the occupation of more than one family, of which a large number exist in this district. The 23rd section of the Act provides for the disinfection of woollen articles, clothing, and bedding which may have been rendered liable to communicate disease to others. There is no doubt that epidemic disease is continually propagated by infected clothing. Even amongst some of the richer classes little is thought during illness of the danger of communicating disease to the healthy; and infected articles of wearing apparel are no doubt often sent to the laundress, and mixed with those belonging to the healthy, without thought as to the previous disinfection; and bedding and other appendages are merely exposed to the air. But amongst the poor the danger exists to a greater degree, as they have not the means at their command of overcoming this danger; and epidemic disease is largely propagated from this cause alone. Sewers are made, drains are trapped and attended to, houses cleansed and lime-whited, and yet this, one of the most fertile sources of epidemic disease, is usually neglected. Of all disinfectants, heat is the best; and if a steam oven were erected in some central part of this district, and a conveyance procured for the removal of infected articles, and their delivery in a pure state; medical men in attendance upon infected cases would be always ready to assist the local authority in urging this necessity upon the inhabitants, and epidemic desease would doubtless be much lessened in its severity. The 37th section of the Act provides for the establishment of an hospital or hospitals for the reception of the sick. Amongst a population of 40,000 persons residing in the Lewisham District, no such establishment exists. 17 A cottage hospital, containing a few beds, would not be an expensive establishment, and would greatly tend to mitigate suffering. In some districts an establishment of this kind is made in part self-supporting. The 43rd section of the Act enables local Boards to encourage the establishment of baths and washhouses. In this large district no facilities for bathing exist, and in some instances all the washing, (and in wet weather all the drying), ot linen by the poor has to be done in their own houses or rooms, and renders them uncomfortable and unwholesome. Establishments of this kind might be made self-supporting, or, if not, would be assisted by the subscriptions of the inhabitants; and a disinfecting chamber might be connected with the building. Section '24th of the Act empowers the nuisance authority to maintain carriages for the conveyance to the hospital or their own homes persons suffering under any coutagious or infectious disease. The only vehicle in this district for the conveyance of persona labouring under contagious disease is the property of the Board of Guardians of the Lewisham Union, and I am not aware whether this is always available for the removal of sick persons. But such a conveyance should be readily available at all times, in order to prevent the infection of the public cabs and railway carriages, which are at times used for such purposes; and these are media for the spread of disease. Although a large amount of most beneficial work has been done as regards the sewerage of the district, and although the greater part of this district is now well drained; still some parts are without drainage; by which I mean that houses are only drained into cesspools, which would require periodical pumping in the clay portions of the district, or they would overflow and deposit their decomposing contents upon the adjacent land or into ditches; or in the gravel portions of the 18 district their contents would percolate through the soil and might contaminate adjacent wells. These cesspools again are seldom veutilated, and the gaseous products of decomposition are liable to find their way into dwelling houses. The ventilation of sewers also requires particular attention. It is necessary that sewers should be ventilated ; otherwise, whilst the present system of drainage exists, the gases formed from their decomposing contents would be liable to find their way into dwelling houses, especially when the atmosphere within them is rarefied by heat. But the offensive smell from these ventilating apertures is often complained of, more especially in the higher portions of the district, where, from tho gases being lighter than atmospheric air, they are more likely to exude. In such cases charcoal ventilating boxes might be, and have in some cases been, affixed; but if this were not sufficient, ventilating pipes, or shafts, might be placed by the sido of buildings; but in no case should the number of apertures be diminished. In the case of old drains no ventilation would be likely to exist, and it is therefore of importance to remove all drainage of this class. As regards the drainage of the district. I am not aware that any register exists which would accurately detail tho plan and method of drainage of every house in the district, and some difficulty might arise in determining whether some houses are efficiently drained. A ledgered list of all houses or blocks of houses should be formed, with reference to a numbered plan, from which it might be ascertained when, in what manner, and into what receptacles houses are drained. This would much facilitate the business of the Board, and be of great advantage to its officers. The water supply of the district, although usually of good quality, is only given every other day and not upon Sundays, and is stored in receptacles which in some instances are inadequate as to size, and in many instances are of an improper character. 19 In many instances open butts are the only receptacles upplied, and these become foul and render the water deleterious. Again, cisterns from neglect in cleansing also become coated and unwholesome, and frequent inspection is necessary to secure a pure supply from these sources. I believe that a constant supply, with water waste preventors, would be not only beneficial to the water companies, but a benefit to the inhabitants. Much water is wasted by the intermittent system, from ball taps being out of order, or removed, and from other damage to the fittings. The experience of such towns as Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and some others proves that the objection entertained by the London companies to the constant supply system on the score of waste is not founded upon fact. In conclusion, I would say that this is, as the present report proves, and always has been, a highly favoured and healthy district. Let us endeavour to render it a model one. I am sure that the Board and all its officers will use their utmost endeavours to make it so. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E.

Object and Extent of the Act. This Act is intended to extend the protection afforded by the "Factory Acts Extension Act, 1867," so far as respects the regulation of working in smaller establishments, the hours of Labour to Children, Young Persons, and Women; and further, to provide for the use of a Fan, or other mechanical means, for preventing tho inhalation of Dust by Workmen in the processes of Grinding. The Act applies to every room or place, whether in the open air or under cover, in which any manual labour is exercised by way of trade, or for the purposes of gain, in making any article, or in any way adapting any article for sale; but not to any Factory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the Inspectors of Factories, nor to any Bakehouse. How Enforced. It is the duty of the Board of Works for the Lewisham District to enforce the provisions of the Act within their jurisdiction. On complaint of any Officer of Health, Inspector of Nuisances, or other Officer appointed by a Local Authority, or of any Superintendent of Police, a Justice of the Peace may, by order under his hand, empower such complainant to enter a Workshop within forty-eight hours from the date of such order, and to examine such Workshop, and any person therein, touching the provisions of this Act, or of the Sanitary Act, 1866. Any person refusing admission to the Officer so empowered, or obstructing him in the discharge of his duty, is liable to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. Every Inspector and Sub-Inspector has power to enter any Workshop, and examine the condition thereof, and the persons therein, touching the provisions of this Act, or the Sanitary Act, 1866. Any person obstructing such Inspector or Sub-Inspector is liable to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. Employment of Children wider Thirteen Years of Age. No Child under the age of eight years shall be employed in any handicraft. No Child under the age of thirteen years shall be employed for more than six and a half hours in any one day, nor before six a.m., nor after eight p.m. No Child under the age of eleven years shall be employed in Grinding in the metal trades, or in Fustian Cutting. No Child shall be employed in any handicraft on Sunday, or after two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, except where not more than five 23 persons arc employed in making articles to be sold by retail on the premises, or in repairing articles of a like nature to those sold by retail on the premises. School Attendance and Certificates. Every Child under the age of thirteen years employed in a workshop shall attend School for at least ten hours in every week. No attendance can be reckoned on Sundays, or before eight a.m., or after six p.m., or in excess of three hours at any one time, or of five hours in any ono day. A ChiId mny he excused if the Teacher certify that the Child has been unable to attend from Sickness, or other unavoidable cause; or during the closing of tho School for the customary holidays, or other temporary cause; or while there is no School within one mile from the workshop or the residence of the Child. Parents must cause their Children employed in any workshop to attend School, as required by the Act. Any Parent who wilfully fails to send his Child to School is liable to a penalty of not more than Twenty Shillings. Occupiers of workshops must, on Monday in every week, obtain a Certificate from tho Teacher that the Children whom they employed have attended Sehool during the preceding week. The Certificate should be in this form: — School. I do hereby certify that A 11. has attended the above School for not less than Ten Hours during the iceek ending on Saturday, the day of 186 C. D , Principal Teacher of the above School. Date and Address of School. The Certificate must be kept for ono month, and must be produced to any Inspector or Sub-Inspcctoor of Factories whenever required during that period. Every occupier not obtaining such Certificate, or refusing to produce it to an Inspector or Sub-Inspector of Factories, is liable to a penalty of not moro than Three Pounds. On the written application of a Teacher, an occupier is to pay a weekly sum, not exceeding twopence, for the schooling of a Child employed by him, and may deduct it from the wages ol the Child. Any Occupier who refuses to pay such School fees when so required is liable to a penalty not exceeding Ten Shillings. Employment of Young Persons above the age of Thirteen Years and under the age of Eighteen Years, and of Women. No Young Person or Woman can be employed in any handicraft in any one day for more than twelve hours, nor before five a.m., nor after nine p.m. One hour and a half must be allowed for meals. Nor shall they be employed in any handicraft on Sunday, or after two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, except where not more than five persons arc employed in making articles to be sold by retail on the 24 premises, or in repairing articles of a like nature to those sold by retail on the premises. Where the Occupier is of the Jewish religion, and it is his custom to keep his workshop closed on Saturday until sunset, he may employ Young Persons or Women on that day from after sunset until nine o'clock at night. The penalties for the employment of Children, Young Persons, and Women, contrary to the provisions of this Act, are—1st, The Occupier of the workshop is liable to a penalty not exceeding Three Pounds; 2nd, The Parent or person deriving any direct benefit from the labour of, or having the control over, the Child, Young Person, or Woman, is liable to a penalty of not more than Twenty Shillings. Provision with respect to use of Fan in Grinding. If it appear to the Local Authority, or any Inspector of Factories, that the inhalation of dust arising from any process could be prevented by the use of a Fan, or other mechanical means, a Fan, or such mechanical means as may be approved by one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State, may be required to be provided by the Occupier of tho workshop within a reasonable time. The penalty for non-compliance therewith is not less than Three Pounds, nor exceeding Ten Pounds, but the Court may, in addition to or instead of tho said penalty, give a certain time for providing tho said Fan, or mechanical contrivance, and after the expiration of such time, a further penalty is incurred, not exceeding Oue Pound for each day that such non-compliance continues. Temporary Exceptions. Until the 1st day of July, 1868, Children of eleven years of age may be employed as Young Persons of thirteen. Until the 1st day of July, 1870, Children of twelve years of ago may be employed as Young Persons of thirteen. Until the 1st day of January, 18G9, Children, Young Persons, and AVomen may be employed until half-past Four o'clock on Saturday afternoon. Until the 1st day of July, 1870, Children, Young Persons, and Women may be employed in the manufacture of Preserves from fruit in the same manner as they were employed before the passing of this Act. Until the 1st day of July, 1870, Male Young Persons of not less than sixteen years of age may be employed in the manufacture of Machinery as if they were Male Persons exceeding the age of eighteen years. The Secretary of State is empowered to authorise the employment of Male Young Persons at night, and the substitution of another day for the Saturday half holiday, where the customs or exigencies of certain trades require such modification.
