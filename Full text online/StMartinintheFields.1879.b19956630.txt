Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields, for the Tear 1879. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Tenth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The mortality in 1879 was higher than any of the previous 8 years.. Why this increase I am unable to state; there was no outbreak of any particular epidemic to account for it, with the exception of a few more deaths from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria than in the previous years. This larger number of deaths may be due to the inclement season of 1879. B 18 Births. The Births registered in the year 1879 were 481, that is 14 more than in the preceding year. The following Table shows the number of Births occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 25 30 55 February 20 20 40 March 20 18 38 April 26 21 47 May 17 18 35 June 14 15 29 July 23 20 43 August 29 20 49 September 13 24 37 October 24 18 42 November 12 18 30 December 20 16 36 243 238 481 Deaths. The Deaths registered in the year 1879 amounted to 557, being 38 more than in the previous year. 19 The following Table shows the number of Deaths occurring in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 36 24 60 February 21 20 41 March 27 26 53 April 40 26 66 May 28 20 48 June 18 16 34 July 27 18 45 August 22 12 34 September 18 14 32 October 31 15 46 November 20 11 31 December 40 27 67 328 229 557 Of the above 557 deaths, 198 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of this number who died in the Hospital, 163 were non-residents in St. Martin-in-theFields. These 163 deducted from the total deaths will give the true death-rate of the Parish. Deaths, 1879 557 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 163 394 20 Death-rate per 1,000 for the year 1879, 18.6 Ratio of Deaths to population 1 in 53 By the above figures the death-rate per 1,000 for the year 1879 was 18.6. This death-rate, though higher than the previous year is not considered an unhealthy death-rate. The death-rate per 1,000 for the whole of London in the year 1879 was 233 against 23.5 of the previous year. Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the last nine years:— 1871 19.4 1872 18.7 1873 20.2 1874 18.6 1875 18.3 1876 17.2 1877 16.9 1878 17.5 1879 18.6 Ages at Death. Of the 557 deaths, 184 occurred in children under 5 years of age, 45 between 5 and 20 years, 96 between 20 and 40 years, 141 between 40 and 60 years, 81 between 60 and 80 years, and 10 above 80 years. Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.— This important class of disease includes Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, 21 Croup, Whooping Cough, Typhus Fever, Typhoid Fever, Simple Continued Fever, Remittent Fever, Diarrhoea, and Cholera. The mortality from these diseases was •r 58; this number is in excess of the previous year. Smallpox.—No death occurred from this disease. Measles.—There were 5 deaths from this disease, which was 2 more than in the previous year. Scarlet Fever.—14 deaths were due to this malady. This number is greatly in excess of previous years, but it should be stated that Scarlet Fever last year was very prevalent in the Metropolis. Diphtheria.—Was productive of 8 deaths. Whooping Cough was fatal to 12. This is the same number as the preceding year. Fever.— This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever and Remittent Fever. 7 deaths were registered from this class of disorders. 6 were due to Typhoid Fever, and 1 to Simple Continued Fever. Diarrhœa.—7 deaths were caused by this malady, a number unusually low. This great falling off in diarrhoeal mortality was common to the whole of London, and was due to the cold wet weather, which prevailed throughout the summer, when infantile diarrhoea is usually so great a scourge. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs.—Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 200. This number is 24 in excess of the previous year. This large increase is due to the inclement season of last year. 22 Diseases of the Heart.—48 deaths were registered from this complaint, against 37 of last year. Cancer proved fatal to 14 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed in a table at the end of my Report. Inquests. In the year 1879, there were held 60 inquests. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 24 Injuries received from falling downstairs 3 Run over or knocked down in the street 6 Burns and scalds 1 Cause not ascertained 2 Injuries received from falling through a skylight 1 Suffocation (children, when in bed with Parents) 2 Drowning (No evidence to show how deceased came into the water 4 5 Drowning (Suicide) 1 Fall from a window 3 Pistol-shot wound (suicide) 2 3 „ „ (accidental) 1 Hanging (Suicide) 2 Starvation and exposure 1 Fracture of Hip-joint from accidental fall 1 Carried forward 54 23 Brought forward 54 Poisoning (Suicide) with carbolic acid 1 Injuries received on falling from steps 2 Injuries to head from accidental fall 1 Injuries received from getting out of a train while in motion at the Charing Cross Railway Station, S. E. R. 1 Injuries received by a blow from a butt of wine while unlading 1 60 Bakehouses. The several Bakehouses situated in the Parish have been duly inspected. Some few I have caused notices to be served upon the owners for the purpose of limewhiteing, etc. Sanitary Work. In the year 1879, 85 notices were served upon owners or occupiers of property to remedy sanitary defects. The several courts and passages in the Parish have been lime-whited from time to time. The pipe-sewers have been regularly flushed; and those gullies in the streets which at times emit offensive effluvia, have been occasionally flushed with carbolic acid and water. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street. 24 Summary of Sanitary Work performed during the Year 1879.
