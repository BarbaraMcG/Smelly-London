AC. 4369 adid. PLON 74 122 CORPORATION OF LONDON PORT HEALTH AUTHORITY ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH To 31st DECEMBER, 1966 To be presented, 14th December, 1967 CONSTITUTION AND JURISDICTION The governing body of the City of London, the Corporation of London, was originally constituted the Sanitary Authority of the Port of London by Section 20 of the Public Health Act, 1872. The cost of administration was met from the Corporation's private funds for close on fifty years, when it became rate (and grant) aided. By the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the term "Port Sanitary" was changed to "Port Health", and the Port Health district is further defined by that Act as the "Port of London as established for the purposes of the law relating to the Customs of the United Kingdom" and by the Public Health Act, 1936 as "the Port as established for the purposes of the enactments relating to the Customs". The Public Health (London) Act 1936 was repealed by the London Government Act 1963 but Section 89 (1) of that Act defined the Port of London as "the Port of that name established for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise. In accordance with the provisions of the London Port Health Authority Order 1965 made under Section 41 (1) of the London Government Act 1963 the Corporation of London shall have jurisdiction as Port Health Authority- (a) as respects functions, rights and liabilities of a local authority under the enactments mentioned in Part I of Schedule I of the Order over all waters within the Port and over such part of the district of any riparian authority as comprises the whole of any wharf and of the area within the gates of any dock and the buildings thereon respectively, forming part of or abutting upon the Port. (b) as respects any other functions, rights and liabilities assigned to them, within the Port (The Port of London established for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise.) The limits of the Port of London for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise were originally defined by a Treasury Minute dated 1st August, 1883. They commence at high water mark in the River Thames at Teddington Lock, in the County of Surrey, and extend down both sides of the said River Thames to an imaginary straight line drawn from the Pilot mark at the entrance of Havengore Creek in the County of Essex, to the land's end at Warden Point, in the Isle of Sheppey, in the County of Kent, such point being the north-western limit of the Port of Faversham, and extend up and include both sides of the River Medway to an imaginary straight line drawn from the south-east point of land westward of Coalmouth Creek, thence across the said River Medway to the western-most point of the piece of land which forms the eastern side of Stangate Creek, or, in other words, the north-west point of Fleet Marsh and thence in a southerly direction to Iwade Church in the said County of Kent, and thence in a north-easterly direction to Elmley Chapel in the said Isle of Sheppey, a supposed direct line from Elmley Chapel to Iwade Church, being the western limit of the Port of Faversham, and the said Port of London includes the Islands of Havengore Creek aforesaid, called Potton and Rushley Islands, and so much of the said Creek and Watercourses as extends from it to the town of Rochford, and also includes all other Islands, Rivers, Streams, Creeks, Waters, Watercourses, Channels, Harbours, Docks and places within the before-mentioned limits contained. Following upon the extension of the area of jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority by the Port of London Authority (Extension of Seaward Limit) Act 1964 the area of jurisdiction of the Corporation of London as Port Health Authority was similarly amended by Section 31 of the City of London (Various Powers) Act 1965 which added at the end of the definition of "Port of London" in Section 89 (1) of the London Government Act 1963 the following words: "together with all such waters between the seaward limit of the Port as so established and imaginary straight lines drawn from latitude 51° 37' 00" north, longitude 00° 57' 19" east (Foulness Point in the County of Essex) to latitude 51° 46' 05" north, longitude 01° 20' 32" east (Gunfleet Old Lighthouse) and thence to latitude 51° 26' 36" north, longitude 01° 25' 30" east and thence to latitude 51° 24' 55" north, longitude 00° 54' 21' east (Warden Point in the County of Kent) as are for the time being within the territorial waters of Her Majesty's dominions." The Port of London Authority with which the Port Health Authority works in close co-operation was established as the administrative body of the Port of London including the docks and tideway of the River Thames, by Act of Parliament in 1909. January, 1967. To: THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COMMONERS OF THE CORPORATION OF LONDON. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit as Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1966.

The Port of London trades with all parts of the world. SECTION IV INLAND BARGE TRAFFIC These barges are registered annually by the Port of London Authority. They vary in design and type from open and hatched all purpose general cargo barges, to specialised types for bulk sugar and refrigerated cargoes. An increasing number of the latter have refrigeration plant incorporated in the design. The trend towards amalgamation of barge fleets has reduced the total number in the Port to approximately 6,000 barges with an aggregate tonnage of some 430,000 tons. The craft are employed in the transport of a wide variety of cargoes throughout the Port area and its environment by way of creeks and canals. SECTION V WATER SUPPLY 1. Source of Supply. No change. 2. Reports of tests for contamination. No change. 3. Precautions taken against contamination of hydrants and hosepipes. No change. 4. Number and sanitary conditions of water boats and powers of control by the Authority. No change. There were seven reports of contamination from hydrants during the year and two reports of contamination from the ends of delivery hoses. These were discovered during the normal course of routine sampling. In each case no attributable cause for the contamination was discovered and it must be assumed that contamination had been introduced through the unhygienic handling of the equipment. Fortunately water had not been supplied to shipping from the hydrants but in the case of the ends of delivery hoses, these had been used for water supplies to two ships. The Owners were informed that chlorination of storage and supply lines were advisable and standard measures were adopted in each case. There were 21 reports of contamination of supplies on board ships. These samples were drawn mainly from fresh water taps over galley and messroom sinks. The source of supply to these is from "domestic fresh water" storage in double bottoms and peak tanks. The presence of this potential danger on board indicates the necessity of ensuring that the standard of purity of "domestic" supplies should be as high as the "potable" water supplies. 5 The source of contamination of storage on board two ships, after investigation, indicated that the cause arose from small ports in the Middle and Far East. In each case cleaning of tanks followed by chlorination of storage tanks and supply lines was carried out in accordance with the recommendations laid down in the Ship Master's Medical Guide. The 95.78% of 'Satisfactory', 'Good' and 'Excellent' results in the mains supply of the Districts, as shown in Table 2, exceeded the average for the Port during the past seven years. A result, no doubt, that the Authority's 'Code of Practice' (detailed in last year's report) and policy of frequent sampling has done much to achieve.

They also make minor amendments which ensure conformity with the current International Sanitary Regulations of the World Health Assembly. (a) Provision is made for a new form of International Vaccination Certificate (Regulation 2). (b) A new power has been added to require a person leaving a ship to state his destination when there is grave danger to public health through an outbreak of infectious disease (Regulation 10 (2)). (c) Regulation 19 (4) contains a new provision for repetition of deratting measures where earlier measures seem to have been ineffective. 1.

NO CHANGE DENTON HOSPITAL Although Denton Hospital was taken over by the South East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board under the National Health Service Act, 1946 the Port Health Authority continues to exercise, through the Senior and Assistant Port Medical Officers, the medical supervision of cases admitted to the hospital. The nursing and administrative control lies with the Dartford Hospital Management Committee. Consultant advice on difficult cases is available through the PhysicianSuperintendent of Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford. The number of cases admitted to Denton Hospital in 1966 was as follows:— Chickenpox 8 Bronchitis 2 Axillary Abscess 1 Measles 1 Glandular Fever 1 Infectious Hepatitis 1 Influenza 1 Rubella 2 Typhoid Fever 2 Miscellaneous 7 Tonsillitis 3 TOTAL 29 SECTION VII - SMALLPOX 1. Name of Isolation Hospital to which smallpox cases are sent from the District. Long Reach Hospital is situated on the south bank of the River Thames about eight miles above Gravesend. The hospital consists of 10 ward blocks capable of accommodating 170 patients but, except in cases of emergency, only three ward blocks (2 of 20 beds and 1, a cubicle ward, of 10 beds, total 50 beds) are kept available for immediate use. The hospital includes residential quarters for the staff and a laundry, although the administration and staffing is carried out from Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford. 2. Arrangements for transport of such cases to that Hospital by ambulance giving the name of the Authority responsible for the ambulance and the vaccinal state of the ambulance crews. A case or cases of smallpox would be removed from the vessel by this Authority's Ambulance launch and conveyed ashore via the pontoon at Denton and from thence conveyed by road ambulance direct to Long Reach Hospital. The Port Health Authority would be responsible for the vaccinal state of their Ambulance Launch crews, while the vaccinal state of the Road Ambulance personnel would be the concern of the ambulance authority, the Greater London Council. 3.

Kershaw Dr. G.D.W. McKendrick Dr. A. Melvin Ramsay Dr. E. O' Sullivan 4. Facilities for laboratory diagnosis of smallpox Facilities are available at the Virus Laboratory at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. Examination of International Certificates of Vaccination against Smallpox By the provisions of the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1966, the Medical Officer may require the production of international certificates of vaccination against smallpox by persons arriving from abroad and will require production of such certificates if so requested by the Minister of Health. The Minister has requested that all persons arriving on ships coming within 14 days, from smallpox locally infected or endemic areas be in possession of such a certificate and this applies whether the persons have themselves come from these areas or not. Because of the difficulty of examining vaccination certificates of persons arriving in the Port of London where ships discharge their passengers at widely divergent points, shipping companies have been asked to arrange for lists of smallpox vaccination certificates of passengers and crew, 8. counter-signed by the Master and by the ship's surgeon, if carried, to be produced on the arrival of the ship in the Port.

Date of onset was given as February, 1966, but the Seaman had been referred by the Ship's Surgeon to the Dermatology Unit only in late October, 1966, and was admitted at that time. He had not been reported as sick on arrival in the Port. He had had a rash for some eight months. Investigation showed that the man was a general servant working in passengers cabins. Fortunately the case was tuberculoid in type and, therefore, of very slight, if any, infectivity. TYPHOID FEVER (1) A seaman was admitted to Denton Hospital on the 30th April from a ship inward bounc from West African Ports. The provisional diagnosis on admission was P.U.O (?) malaria but the case was subsequently diagnosed as typhoid fever. Thorough investigations were carried out in the case of African and European crew members remaining on board whilst the vessel was in dock and Medical Officers of Health of the various areas to which the other seamen had gone on 9. signing off, were alerted. No further cases were discovered. (2) Another case of typhoid fever which presented a difficult epidemiological problem first came to notice of the Port Health Authority when a telephone message was received from another London borough saying that a patient who had been diagnosed at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases as suffering from typhoid fever had arrived in the Port of London from Bombay some five weeks previously. Furthermore the hospital indicated a strong possibility that the onset of the illness antedated the patient's embarkation on the ship by some four days. It was, therefore, possible that she had been infectious during the whole of her time on the ship. This was particularly disquieting, especially as the lapse of time between the ship arriving in the Thames (when no declaration had been made that the patient was ill) and notification of the final diagnosis reaching this Authority made normal surveillance procedures useless. The following measures were therefore adopted, in consultation with the Ministry of Health:— (a) With regard to passengers it was apparent that after such a lapse of time the address lists submitted by the master of the ship on arrival would, in many cases, be no longer accurate and consideration was given to the possibility of informing all health authorities of the circumstances so that Medical Officers of Health would be alerted. It was decided, however, that too long a time had elapsed for even this measure to be worthwhile because any cases due to contact on the ship would already have developed and, as no such cases had been reported, it was considered highly unlikely that any of the other passengers had been infected. (b) The members of the crew were also a difficult problem, as, by the time the case came to the notice of the Port Health Authority the vessel was cruising and was not due back in Southampton for another week. In consultation with the Shipping Company it was determined that some four fifths of the crew (and this included all the Goanese saloon crew members) who had been on board at the same time as the patient, had signed on again and a cable was sent to the ship's surgeon to inform him of what had happened. The Medical Officer of Health of Southampton was also notified. This left approximately one fifth of the crew still unaccounted for and they presented a most difficult problem as they could be scattered all over the world. A comparison of crew lists showed that 130 members of the crew had not re-signed articles and with the most willing co-operation of the Shipping Federation Medical Service it was established that the majority of these men had remained with the same shipping company and were, therefore, comparatively easy to follow up. The small number still outstanding were found living at home and a few had left the ship before the patient had embarked at Bombay. All crew members (except these last few) were followed up but no further cases were reported. SECTION X OBSERVATIONS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF MALARIA ON SHIPS No cases of Malaria were reported on ships during the year under review. This compares with four cases in 1965. SECTION XI MEASURES TAKEN AGAINST SHIPS INFECTED OR SUSPECTED OF PLAGUE No ships infected with or suspected of plague arrived during the year. SECTION XII MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS IN SHIPS FROM FOREIGN PORTS A five day rodent and parasite seminar was held in Geneva by the World Health Organisation during the year. The rat was described as "the travelling salesman of the scourge". It was appropriate, in view of the war in South Vietnam and the subsequent outbreak of plague in that country, that the subject should be discussed and the world alerted to possible dangers. This grim reminder helps to prevent complacency and stresses the perpetual need of care and attention to rodent control measures within the Port. As mentioned earlier in this report the Public Health (Ships) Regulations 1966 introduced a new provision giving powers to require repetitive deratting measures where there is definite evidence that earlier measures seem to have been ineffective, or the number of rodents on board is substantially more than negligible. Not-withstanding the validity of the Deratting Certificate or Deratting Exemption Certificate the medical officer may exercise his powers to require the ship to be deratted in a manner to be determined by him. 10 (i) Procedure for inspection of ships for rats. The Port Health Authority employs an experienced and competent team of seventeen Rodent Inspectors, who exercise control measures on all ships and shore premises within the Port area under the supervision of the Port Health Inspectors. The Rodent Inspector's first duty is to visit all ships arriving in his district as soon as possible after arrival and search for evidence of rodents. Priority is given to ships which have arrived from plague endemic areas. Further visits to these ships are made during the discharge of cargo to ascertain the degree of infestation on board, if any, and to ensure that reasonable measures are adopted to reduce the number of rodents on board to a negligible number and prevent any rodents escaping ashore. His second duty is the inspection of ships in his area for the specific purpose of issuing Deratting or Deratting Exemption Certificates or Rodent Control Certificates. The Rodent Inspector's third duty is the inspection of shore premises and lighters for signs of rodent infestation. The Port Health Authority has continued to operate a Rodent Control Scheme, inaugurated twenty five years ago, covering all the docks and including all the premises of the Port of London Authority on behalf of that Authority and premises of tenants of the Authority on behalf of the occupiers. (ii) Arrangements for the bacteriological examination of rodents, with special reference to rodent plague, including the number of rodents sent for examination during the year. All dead rats to be examined for evidence of plague, are promptly despatched in suitable sealed containers to the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. The robust rectangular metal boxes which have been used for a number of years to deliver such specimens have been replaced by a cylindrical pattern made of aluminium, with a scew cap. Specimen rats are placed in polythene bags already dusted with gammaxene to kill any parasites, labelled and placed inside the cylinder for delivery by hand. During the year 86 rats were sent to the laboratory at Colindale and were examined for plague with negative results. (iii) Arrangements in the district for deratting ships, the methods used, and if done by a commercial contractor, the name of the contractor. (a) The burning of sulphur at the rate of 31bs. per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a minimum period of 6 hours. This method is seldom used now in the Port of London. (b) The generation of hydrocyanic acid gas by various methods. For the destruction of rats a minimum concentration of H.C.N. at the rate of 2 ozs. per 1,000 cubic feet of space is required with a minimum of two hours exposure. (c) Sodium-fluoraocetate ("1080") and "Warfarin". The employment of "1080" as a rodenticide has been regularly used throughout the docks for some time with highly satisfactory results. The prohibition on the use of "1080" and "1081" except in ships and sewers, which was imposed in June 1965, has continued in force. A substantial number of ships have been deratted by "1080" in preference to the use of cyanide resulting in a considerable saving of time and cost to the ship owner. (d) Trapping. This method is seldom used except as an expedient to eliminate isolated rats and/or to secure specimens for the laboratory. (e) Methyl Bromide. This is a very effective and lethal fumigant which has been used over a number of years in the Port as an insecticide, particularly in the dried fruit industry. It has considerable penetration powers and is not difficult to disperse after an operation. It is also possible to use this gas as a rodenticide and where there is an infestation of rodents and insects the combined problem can be solved with one operation. The following are the names of the firms approved for carrying out the deratting of ships:— London Fumigation Co. Ltd. Contra-Pest Service Ltd. Rentokil Laboratories Ltd. (iv) Progress in the Rat Proofing of Ships. The necessity for rat proofing has been recognised in modern ship construction. In post-war years the principle was stressed as a measure to deny rodents conditions in which they could hide in obscure places, have free communication between compartments and access to food or drink. Previously many ships offered an open invitation to rodents and provided means for perpetual infestation. It has become the practice ef ship designers wherever possible to eliminate inaccessible spaces where rodents can hide and nest and where such spaces cannot be avoided to ensure that they are enclosed by materials through which a rodent cannot gnaw. 11 RODENT CONTROL MEASURES CARRIED OUT ON LIGHTERS Since 1954, when detailed records were first kept, there has been a marked decrease in the percentage of lighters which on inspection have required deratting and the most satisfactory figures so far achieved are those recorded this year. Only 47 (1.4%) of the 3,294 lighters inspected needed treatment and from these a total of 172 rats, an average of 3.7 rats per lighter, were recovered. Together with the chemical methods of control the prime factor for the continued decrease in the rodent infestation of lighters is undoubtably the rat proofing measures undertaken by the Lighterage Industry following the adoption of rat proofing techniques discussed generally in 1959. The success of these techniques has encouraged more owners to adopt them and rat proofing is now an accepted method of rodent control on lighters. The methods of deratting employed throughout the year were:— 1. Sulphur Dioxide gas. 2. Methyl Bromide Vapour 3. Sodium mono-fluoroacetate baiting. The method of treatment is determined by the circumstances and degree of infestation at the time of inspection. Throughout the year 664 lighters were fumigated with Methyl Bromide for insect control of the cargo and as the dosage required varies between twenty and thirty ounces per 1,000 cubic feet according to the species of insect pest, with a twenty-four hour exposure period this is /more than sufficient to destroy any rats that may be present at the time of fumigation. During the year eighteen of the rats recovered from treated lighters were sent to the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale for routine bacteriological examination. Pasturella pestis was NOT isolated from any specimen.

On the 16th December information was received from the Police that an isotope unit consigned to the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority at Harwell which was stowed with other cargo in a hold of a vessel lying in the docks was very warm and had been isolated. The Port Health Inspector in the Surrey Docks was notified and reported that a team from the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority at Harwell arrived at the ship in the afternoon on the 17th December and after investigation declared there was no immediate danger; they took the container with them to Harwell. They mentioned that it was not unusual for some containers to become heated. It was noted that this container was very warm when uncovered and possibly it may have been even warmer when covered by a cargo of talc in paper bags since it had time to cool after it had been exposed. This was after quite a short voyage. It would seem there may be some danger of fire in similar circumstances especially if the voyage had been longer and in a warmer climate and if the cargo had been more inflammable. DISPOSAL OF SHIP'S REFUSE The problem of the disposal of ship's domestic refuse is allied to that of sewage disposal and can be quite irksome for the crews that are obliged to carry the refuse ashore to the appointed receptacles, particularly as this is often carried out whilst cargo is being discharged and by way of the ship's gangway. In particular circumstances there may be some arrangement for the bulk of the refuse to be hoisted ashore by crane but there still remains the emptying of the container. Nobody, therefore likes doing the job and the refuse is often badly dumped at the dock receptacles. In other cases the refuse is ignored and allowed to accumulate aboard to become a nuisance prejudicial to health and, as a large part of it is associated with food waste, is likely to attract rodent and insect pests aboard. One way of overcoming the problem would be to introduce a properly constructed compartment within the ship to contain all the refuse which could then be released overboard at a convenient time at sea. The fact that the major part of this refuse is waste or putrescible foodstuffs suggests that it would soon be consumed by sea scavengers. Since the method of discharge could be by 14 gravity, storage might well be in a compartment in the stem where the refuse could be fed through a self-closing hopper on deck and released through the shell plate and so dispersed in the wake of the ship. Constructional detail could facilitate proper cleansing and other treatment as necessary. SECTION XIV PUBLIC HEALTH (SHELLFISH) REGULATIONS, 1934 The Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1934, confer powers on a local authority whereby on receipt of a report of their Medical Officer of Health that the consumption of shellfish taken from a laying is likely to cause danger to public health, they may make an Order prohibiting the distribution for sale for human consumption of shellfish taken from the laying either absolutely or subject to such exceptions and conditions as they think proper, having regard to the interests of the public health. Two such Orders have been made. The first in 1936, covering the public and private layings bordering that part of the foreshore of the Estuary of the River Thames between Canvey Island and Shoeburyness; and the second, in 1957, covering the foreshore or waters bordering on that part of the Estuary of the River Thames or any tributary thereof, between Garrison Point, Sheerness, and Warden Point in the Isle of Sheppey. No contraventions of the Orders were reported during the year. Oyster Industry Fattening of imported Portuguese oysters in the River Roach, as reported in the last two Annual Reports, was discontinued from December, 1965, but the cultivation of native oysters continues satisfactorily. Layings are visited from time to time. Cockle Industry The cockle industry at Leigh continues to flourish and nothing of special significance has happened during the year. The eight approved establishments for sterilizing cockles all conform to a high standard of hygiene and the several requirements of the Order made by this Authority for the purpose of the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations. Inspections are normally carried out whilst the establishment is working and the general condition of the process has been found to be satisfactory. No illness has been reported during the year which could be attributed to the consumption of cockles from these establishments. SECTION XV MEDICAL INSPECTION OF ALIENS AND COMMONWEALTH IMMIGRANTS 1.

Organisation of the work:— Alien and Commonwealth Immigrants are examined by one of the above panel of doctors, at the request of an Immigration Officer. The majority of ships carrying immigrants are dealt with by the Boarding Medical Officer but a part-time Medical Inspector may be called in to deal with a particular ship. Since the inception of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act the larger passenger ships have been boarded at Ports of call prior to their arrival in London as noted below. 4. Alien Immigrant Arrivals (a) Total number of arriving ships carrying aliens 3,066 (b) Total number of aliens — (i) arriving at the port 54,747 (ii) medically examined 37 (c) Certificates issued 2 15 Commonwealth Immigrant Arrivals Commonwealth citizens subject to control 12,222 Commonwealth citizens examined 434 Certificates issued 2 Ships were boarded by members of the panel of doctors at the following ports:— Ceuta 1 Palma 1 Marseilles 1 Gibraltar 2 Lisbon 2 Le Havre 2 Rotterdam 3 Brixham 4 London 104 120 5. Medical examination of alien and Commonwealth immigrants is carried out on board ship-. SECTION XVI MISCELLANEOUS Arrangements for the burial on shore of persons who have died on board ship from infectious disease. The body of any person dying on board ship, or in Denton Hospital, from infectious disease would normally be removed from the ship or Denton Hospital for burial by a Private Undertaker acting on the instructions of the shipping company or the next-of-kin, the local police being kept informed. In the event of the death being one of smallpox, special instructions as to precautions to be taken would be given to the undertaker by the Port Health Authority. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 THE DARK SMOKE (PERMITTED PERIODS) (VESSELS) REGULATIONS, 1958 Dense smoke from ships in the Port of London is no longer a major problem. No prosecutions were instituted during the year although on a number of occasions possible contraventions of the Regulations were prevented only by the prompt intervention of the Port Health Inspectors who gave immediate advice and practical assistance in the methods of preventing dark and black smoke emissions. The difficulty of making direct representation to the Master of an offending ship whilst under way is now mitigated by the more widespread use of V.H.F. radio equipment with which three of the Authority's launches are provided. CANAL BOATS The Canal Boat Regulations of 1878 were made by the Local Government Board under the Canal Boats Act 1877. Minor amendments were made to the Regulations in 1925. The powers of the Local Government Board were subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Health. The Public Health Act 1936 repealed the whole of the Canal Boats Act 1877 except the section relating to the education of employees' children and two sections relating to the title and extent of the Act. Part X (Sections 249/258) of the Public Health Act 1936 incorporated the repealed sections of the Canal Boats Act 1877. The Local Government Act 1966 has now repealed, amended and deleted much of Part X of the Public Health Act 1936. Two subsections of the section relating to regulations have been deleted with the result that there are now no registration authorities and canal boats are no longer required to be registered nor carry a certificate of registration. The control of lettering, marking and numbering has been relinquished. Regulations 1 — 7 of the Canal Boat Regulations 1878, which relate to these powers have therefore been repealed. The remaining regulations 8 - 14 remain. These provide for fixing the number, age and sex of persons who may be permitted to dwell in canal boats; in regard to separation of the sexes and the general healthiness and convenience of the accommodation; for promoting cleanliness and ensuring the habitable condition of canal boats; and for preventing the spread of infectious disease. All the Canal boats inspected during the year were found to be clean and of satisfactory standard. 16 LOADING AND TRANSPORT OF REFUSE BY LIGHTERS Routine visits to refuse loading wharves and depots and the inspection of lighters engaged in this trade have been maintained. In the early part of the year a tour of the refuse wharves situated in the Middle and Upper River District was made, with senior representatives of the Public Health Engineering Department of the Greater London Council, on board the Launch "Alfred Roach". It was agreed that the operational arrangements on some of the wharves were out of date. Spillage, although intermittent, was, in the aggregate, too much to be condoned and was not in accord with the Port of London Authority's drive for cleaning up the Thames. Plans, both short and long term, were outlined in relation to each wharf. A period of investigation and experiment into the possibilities of pulverising, shredding, and compacting refuse and the feasability of incineration at central destructor depots will be necessary before a rational evaluation of the whole subject of refuse disposal of the metropolis will be possible. An overall plan will be formulated at a later date, which it is hoped will lead to closures and redevelopment of some wharves and the construction of new wharves at more strategic points. The local authority functions at all the operational wharves were transferred, during the period March to November, to the control of the Greater London Council, with a notable improvement in tipping operations and environmental control. At the end of the year, there were eleven refuse wharves on the River or creek banks, two depots with an integrated private dock and one wharf outside the District, but from which laden refuse lighters pass through the District. No prosecutions were instituted under the Authority's Byelaws during the year. Minor infringements were dealt with immediately and directly by personal representation. HOUSEBOATS Benfleet and Canvey Island The Essex County Council Act 1952 provides that the moorings of any houseboat within the County shall not be lawful without the consent of the Council of the district in which the houseboat is situated and that the council may require the owner or occupier to remove or demolish any houseboat not authorised by them. The Port Health Authority are, however, still responsible for sanitary supervision of houseboats coming within the jurisdiction of the Port Health Authority, although under the Essex County Council Act 1952 the local council in Essex is responsible for the licensing and stipulating conditions under which licenses to the residents of houseboats in their area will be granted. Functions of the Port Health Authority with regard to the sanitary supervision of houseboats in Essex are safeguarded by Section 212 of the Essex County Council Act 1952 which provides inter alia that no consent shall be given to moor any houseboat within the Port of London without the previously written consent of the Corporation of London as Port Health Authority of the Port of London. Eighteen temporary consents were granted during the year by Benfleet Urban District Council with the concurrence of the Port Health Authority. Although these consents permit human habitation only four of the houseboats are permanently occupied. The adverse conditions in relation to reasonable access to drinking water and the disposal of sewage and refuse, which have always been a problem, have been reviewed and it is doubtful whether the licenses granted to these craft will be renewed after this year. Upper River Area There are approximately 285 houseboats in the upper area of the River, mainly situated in the Chelsea Reach. All are in good condition. DANGEROUS DRUGS During the year twenty certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued under the Dangerous Drugs (No.2) Regulations, 1964, Regulation 13(2) of which is as follows:— (a) The master of a foreign ship which is in a port in Great Britain shall be authorised to procure such quantity of drugs and preparations as may be certified by the medical officer of health of the port health authority within whose jurisdiction the ship is or, in his absence, by the assistant medical officer of health, to be necessary for the equipment of the ship until it reaches its home port. 17 (b) A person who supplies a drug or preparation in accordance with a certificate given under this paragraph shall retain the certificate and mark it with the date on which the drug or preparation was supplied and keep it on his premises so as to be at all times available for inspection. PIGEON CONTROL The Port Health Authority has no local authority powers under the Public Health Act, 1961 to abate or mitigate any nuisance, annoyance or damage caused by the congregation of pigeons in any built-up area, but powers are available under the Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers, etc.) Regulations, 1960, not to permit the use of premises which are in such a state as to expose food to the risk of contamination and, to this end, the managers of such premises are required to take corrective action to the satisfaction of the Port Health Authority. Official supervision is exercised over operational extermination of feral pigeons which includes trapping, shooting, narcotising and gassing, as well as destruction of the nested eggs. By far the greater number destroyed is by organised narcotic and gas operations. These are conducted by an authorised Contractor, employed by the Port of London Authority, the sites being chosen after careful observations of conditions and circumstances. The Ministry of Agriculture have approved the narcotic "alpha-chloralose" with which a cereal base is impregnated and the stupefied pigeons are then collected, checked for any particular identification, and the feral pigeons given a lethal dose of carbontetrachloride gas. The number of pigeons destroyed during the year is considerably less than in 1965, but this is attributed to the general upheaval and re-construction within the Port, with the demolition of a large granary, and the effectiveness of pigeon control operations in the area immediately outside the Port. (1965) Number of pigeons destroyed by gas and shooting 14,686 (25,550) Number destroyed after trapping 506 ( 822) Number of eggs destroyed 311 ( 1,310) FOOD HYGIENE (DOCKS, CARRIERS, Etc.) REGULATIONS, 1960. The general standard of hygiene continues to improve in all aspects of the Regulations. The siting of sanitary conveniences and their distance from a particular place of work is an important factor to be considered, particularly when men are engaged on piece work and may be disinclined to leave their job for longer than is absolutely necessary. Where mechanical installations have been introduced it is essential that in particular the parts which come in contact with food cargo must be kept clean and therefore design and type of material used are important factors to be considered as well as a cleaning code of practice. To this end close co-operation is maintained with the industry concerning all new installations. FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960/62. Passenger launches which operate the summer services on the River Thames are surveyed annually by the Board of Trade during the early part of the year. This survey is carried out at the owner's repair yard during refit. The opportunity is taken on these occasions to examine those parts of the launches which normally would be inaccessible during service i.e. behind panelling and below floors. Thorough cleaning of these spaces is carried out in addition to protective coating of wood and metal parts. This ensures that launches are in a sanitary condition when they come into service. During this period of refit bulk fresh water storage tanks are opened for inspection and cleaning. They are later chlorinated, together with the distribution system. Particular attention is also paid to paintwork, fittings and equipment. During the summer season every endeavour is made to preserve the initial clean fresh appearance and standard on board. Regular inspection of these craft is carried out under the Regulations. The Food Hygiene standard on board and of the catering establishment from which food is supplied for consumption on board, is highly satisfactory. The policy of successive annual improvements of public amenities on board these craft has received a set back and no improvements were carried out during the 1966 refits. Many of the desirable features previously introduced, such as coloured toilet suites, towels and soap dispensers and quality furnishings have been abused by the public in recent years. Owners are now reluctant to replace these, other than by more durable and purely functional fittings. The three larger vessels continued to operate the traditional services to coastal resorts and the Continent The standard of hygiene on board these vessels has been highly satisfactory. The exemption certificates previously granted to these ships by the Authority, because of the structurally imposed limitation of bulk fresh water storage on board remain in operation. 18 During the year a thirty five year old paddle steamer arrived in the Port to operate a summer passenger service to the estuary towns. The vessel complied with the requirements of the Regulations and the standard of hygiene on board was satisfactory. Owing to intermittent damage to the paddles, she has been unable to maintain a regular service. 31 routine inspections under the Regulations were carried out during the year. The few infringements of a minor nature were corrected at the time of the visit. SEABORNE CONTAINER TRAFFIC There has been seaborne container traffic in this Port on a limited scale since 1962 but it is now increasing year by year. A steady and regular flow arrives from the Continent and Scandinavia and even greater traffic is anticipated from further afield. At present the types of containers used are in two categories i.e. "dock to dock" and "door to door". The "dock to dock" containers which are packed and unpacked in ports are 30ft. long whilst the "door to door" containers are 20ft. long. Both types are used to carry foodstuffs for human consumption, the contents of which, of course, are liable to inspection by the Authority. This means that the "door to door" containers, which are destined to be delivered intact to the consignee's premises, must be specially opened for the purpose and in order that their movement is not unduly impeded, whenever possible suitable arrangements are made with H.M. Customs for the respective inspections to be carried out at the same time. To this end shippers are urged to submit advance information of ships' food cargoes. Fresh meat and similar commodities are not at present conveyed by this method. As the food trade develops a suitable organisation will need to be set up to deal with the imported food inspection procedures and it has already been proposed that where the container has been cleared by H.M.Customs at the port of entry but not seen by the Port Health Authority it will suffice to receive from the importer a written guarantee to the effect that the container will remain sealed until it arrives at the point of destination where it will be dealt with by the local medical officer of health. It is too early to forsee the eventual plan of operation but the indications are that this will be a major industry and modifications to the present port health control will be inevitable.

"URUGUAY" The following report upon the arrival of a consignment of oil damaged and tainted chilled beef is mentioned because of the uniqueness of the incident and the detail involved in ensuring safe disposal of any meat released for reconditioning. On 26th January, a report was received that a vessel, which was bound for London from South America, had reported that a quantity of fuel oil had found its way from the double-bottom tanks into the lower hold space of No.2 hold. From this it could be assumed that the chilled beef in the hold would be either directly contaminated by contact or indirectly by taint. Some 833 tons of chilled beef was involved. The uniqueness of the situation was in that this was chilled and not frozen meat. Chilled meat is carried at a higher temperature than frozen. Therefore changes of temperature and delays in handling can affect the meat to a greater extent and ozonisation cannot be employed to remove taint. It was decided to sort the meat, on arrival, into three categories — (a) meat found on inspection to be free from taint to be released as normal. (b) meat tainted but otherwise sound to be detained pending further consideration. (c) meat damaged and tainted to be released direct to the Corporation's Contractor for destruction. Meanwhile the Underwriters were attempting to find suitable premises where a large quantity of chilled tainted meat could be held pending reconditioning or where such work could be carried out at a rate sufficient to meet the anticipated discharge once the ship commenced working It was considered that the taint would be primarily absorbed by the fat of the meat, and if this were trimmed off with the surface lean meat it would remove all evidence of taint and effect a reasonable saving in sound meat. Premises were found in Wellingborough, Northants, and, following negotiations with the local authorities concerned, it was agreed that the Senior Meat Inspector on the Royal Docks, be allowed to visit the factory suggested to discuss with the local authority officers concerned and the factory staff the suitability of the premises and the work to be done. Satisfactory arrangements were made, and a meeting of interested parties was called to discuss the procedure to be followed when the vessel arrived. Representatives of the following bodies attended: H.M. Customs and Excise; Port of London Authority; Meat Importers; Shipping Agents; South American Purchasing Agency; Underwriters; Stevedoring Company; and the Corporation's Contractor for disposal of Unsound Meat. Sroad agreement was reached on action to be taken, subject to conditions arising at the time. The vessel arrived on 5th February and commenced discharge on the 7th under supervision of Corporation Officers. The first tainted meat was found on 9th February in the Orlop deck and this meat was consigned to Wellingborough. When access was available to the Lower Hold a preliminary inspection was made of the trunkway. The deck was covered with two or three inches of oil fuel; some meat was hanging in this and some free from contact. Following discussions with the stevedoring company, arrangements were made to ensure that directly contaminated and uncontaminated meat were handled separately and that the uncontaminated meat did not become contaminated during handling. Fron this point on only two types of meat were recognised (a) contaminated, which went to the Contractor, and (b) uncontaminated, which went to Wellingborough. Subsequently some 367 tons of meat went to Wellingborough and 71½ tons to the Corporation's Contractor. The meat reconditioned at Wellingborough and found to be sound was released unconditionally and the unsound meat disposed of for purposes other than human consumption. In all some 42.8% of the total weight sent to Wellingborough was saved. Trade representatives stated that this was only the second such instance involving chilled meat that they could recall in the past 40 years. 27 Cutting Room, No. 6 Cold Store, Royal Albert Dock. (134/4521) INSPECTION OF IMPORTED MEATS The following tables give details of the meats which have been dealt with by the Authority during the year. The examination room at No. 6 Cold Store in the Royal Docks is too small to deal adequately with the large quantities of meat due for examination and sampling, but as mentioned in last years report, the Port of London Authority are giving favourable consideration to the construction of an enlarged inspection room.

Adequate supervision of the disposal of such large quantities of meat for pet food is a major problem and brings into question the adequacy of the measures currently enforceable under the Meat (Staining and Sterilization) Regulations 1960. Imported "pet meat" may include meats which are not subject to any form of inspection at the time of slaughter and meats which on inspection at the time of slaughter have been condemned. It is, therefore, a potential health hazard and careful measures to control its use are essential. All consignments of "pet meat" arriving at the docks are subject to scrutiny and control and then allowed forward, under various safeguards, to pet food traders either for sale in a raw state or to be sterilized in a manufacturing process according to its condition. As none of the ultimate users of the meat have premises within the area of this Authority the control of the disposal of "pet meat" released from the dock is transferred to the appropriate local authority and it is at this stage that difficulties arise in the maintenance of adequate supervision. This does not of course imply criticism of any local authority. Complete control over all the channels of distribution is not possible. Staff cannot be allocated to undertake detailed daily supervision of stocks or maintain surveillance over the movement of meat through cold stores, processors, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers especially as each of these may be situated in areas of different local authorities. The inadequacies of the present Regulations are recognised by the Ministries of Health, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as well as by the local authorities and the Regulations are now being revised. In reconsidering the problem it appears that the difficulties of control and risks of misuse could be overcome if all pet meat were to be sterilized prior to importation or distribution but this suggestion is not wholly acceptable as pet food canners require considerable quantities of meat in its raw state. 29 TABLE IV Damaged Meat detained for Reconditioning or Destruction Approximate Weight T C Q Lbs Sheep and Lamb 4,384 C/Cs 87 16 0 0 Cuts B/less Mutton and Lamb 1,572 pkgs 32 7 0 0 Sheep and Lambs Offal 1,894 pkgs 63 4 0 0 Chilled Beef Hinds and Fores 6.990 qtrs 437 9 1 14 Chilled Beef Cuts 49 qtrs 1 5 1 10 B/less Beef 2,309 pkgs 77 0 0 0 Beef and Ox Livers 905 pkgs 30 3 0 0 Other Beef Offals 323 pkgs 10 16 0 0 Beef Suet 309 pkgs 10 10 0 0 B/less Veal 121 pkgs 4 0 0 0 Rabbits 41 pkgs 1 4 0 0 Prepared Meats (Salami etc.) 368 pkgs 12 8 0 0 Fish Fillets 44 pkgs 0 9 3 23 Butter 125 pkgs 3 7 0 0 19,434 pkgs 771 19 2 19 This Authority has proposed that the approval and registration of premises would facilitate closer control over the public health aspects of the trade. This would ensure that no person would be allowed to engage in pet meat trade until his premises, equipment and record keeping system had been inspected and approved by the local authority. FERTILISERS AND FEEDING STUFFS ACT, 1926 FERTILISERS AND FEEDING STUFFS REGULATIONS, 1960 Twenty-four samples of Feeding Stuffs were submitted to the Agricultural Analyst. No sample of Fertiliser was sent. In each case the sample was found to be within the limits of variation permissible under the Regulations. STUDENTS AND VISITORS Student Public Health Inspectors Seven student public health inspectors are employed by the Authority. One completed the four year course and obtained the Diploma of Public Health Inspector. He was subsequently appointed as Port Health Inspector with the Authority. Fifty six student public health inspectors from other local authorities received instruction for three or more days in port health work. Visitors A considerable number of doctors and public health inspectors from home and foreign government departments, local authorities and institutes of health education visited the port during the year. The overseas countries sending visitors included Africa, Australia, Canada, various European Countries, India, Hong Kong, South America and New Zealand.
