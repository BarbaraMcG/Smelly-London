Flushing and Cleansing have been carried out as before, and the Sewers under the charge of the Vestry are in as clear condition as existing circumstances will permit. Complaints of stoppage, flooding, and other defects have been promptly examined and remedied as far as possible, where the duty of doing so has been with the Vestry. 3 Horse Drainage has been constructed where new Sewer have been made, generally without notice being served upon the owners. Applications have been made for the drainage of 446 houses, upon which £776 has been paid into the office. The estimated cost of private work done by the applicants is £5300 which has Wen executed under the inspection and general supervision of the officers of the Vestry. New Buildings. The Vestry have received notices for building 48G new houses, the drainage of which and the level of the lowest floors in relation to the Sewers, have been considered and approved as directed by the Act. Applications made to the Metropolitan Board of "Works for leave to bring out and alter frontages, have been referred by the Vestry and reported upon by them. The Approval of the Metropolitan Board has been given to the formation of 11 New Streets. 4 STATEMENT OF W0RK8 AND IMPROVEMENTS Carried out under the direction of the General Purposes Committee, during the year ending 25th March, 1872.

In the pa9t year, 64 Applications and Memorials have been received for improved lighting in various parts of the Parish, 44 of which were acceded to, by the erection of new lamps and removals, and 20 were refused. There have been 69 new lamps erected and 12 removed to positions, which increased their utility. The total number of public lamps lighted by the Vestry is 2936, and the cost of lighting for the year ended the 25th March, 1872, including the erection of new columns, removals and other expenses amounts to £12,719 6s. 8d. A reduction of 5 per cent, in price has been made during the past year, by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, whereby a saving is affected of 4s. 3d. per lamp. Periodical experiments with the Photometer have been regularly made—and monthly reports have shewn that the illuminating power and purity of the Gas supplied by the several Companies, have been up to the standard which they are bound to supply; although in the case of the Crystal Palace District Gas Company ammonia in small quantities is sometimes found to be present.

(T.C.D.) Gentlemen, In presenting the Sixteenth Annual Report, I have to ask your consideration for any errors that may occur with respect to the results of the first nine months of the Report, as, not having entered into the duties of your Medical Officer of Health until the 1st of January, 1872, I can only hold myself responsible for the accuracy of the figures from that period to the 23rd of March inclusive. I have however, endeavoured, with the materials at my command, to attain to as much accuracy as possible. The illness and consequent absence of your late esteemed Medical Officer left many of the Returns in an unfinished and imperfect condition, involving a considerable amount of labour to me in going over them seriatim more than once. However, I have reason to believe that there are few if any inaccuracies or omissions in the Report, I have now the honour to submit to the Vestry. Since the date of the last Annual Report the Census of 1871 has been taken, and from the Returns made it will appear that the Population of St. Mary's, Lambeth, has increased during the decennial period (1861-71) from 162,044 to 208,302, being an increase of 46,258. The increase has been in the Districts of Lambeth 2nd Church; Kennington, 1st and 2nd; Brixton and Norwood. 11 There has been a alight decrease in the districts of Lambeth 1st Church and Waterloo 1st and 2nd. The Births registered in the Districts during the year 1870-71 were 7835, as compared with 7715 the previous year, of which 19,30 were registered in the first quarter, 1978 in the second, 2006 in the third, and 1901 in the fourth quarter of the year. The Births exceed those of the previous year by 120. The year previously the increase was but 43. The Deaths during the year were 5429, showing an excess of 2406 Births over Deaths; this is, however, 716 less excess of Births than the previous year, but it must be taken into consideration that we have passed through an exceptional year of mortality caused by the continued spread of Small Pox. The Deaths during the four quarters of the year were as follows:— First Quarter 1460 8econd Quarter 1358 Third Quarter 1423 Fourth Quarter1188 The Deaths were 836 in excess of those of 1870-71; but when we deduct from the above, the deaths which have occurred in the different public institutions, of strangers never having resided in, or belonging to the district, amounting to 600, (470 of which were deaths from Small Pox at Stockwell Hospital, brought from all parts of London) the deaths will be only 236 in excess of the previous year; and were it not for the prevalence of Small Pox, there would have been very little if any difference between the rates of mortality for this and last year; and if we allow for the increase of the population, the balance in favour of this year would be still more favourable. In Table II. is shewn the Births and Deaths during each quarter of the year, in each of the Eight Districts of the Parish, from 12 which it will be seen that there were in Waterloo Road, First Part District, 541 Births, and 337 Deaths, during the year; in the Waterloo Road, Second Part, 951 Births, and 449 Deaths; in Lambeth Church, First Part, 734 Births, and 670 Deaths, in Lambeth Church, 2nd Part, 1608 Births, and 1093 Deaths; (289 of which occurred in the Workhouse;) in the Kennington, First Part, 1429 Births, and 795 Deaths; in the Kennington, Second Part, 1007 Births, and 5G8 Deaths; in the Brixton District, 1132 Births, and 1323 Deaths, (of which 663 died in the Small Pox and Fever Hospitals, Stockwell;) and in the Norwood District, 456 Births, and 194 Deaths, The mortality of Lambeth does not at first sight compare as favourably this year, with that of the whole of the Metropolis, as it has hitherto done; this is attributable to the numbers who have died in the several public institutions, especially at the Small Pox and Fever Hospitals, Stockwell. The greater proportion of these were strangers, not belonging to, or ever residing in the district, brought from all parts of London and the country, and should therefore be fairly excluded from our death-rate; they amount in number to 600, deducting these from the total of deaths, our mortality will still continue to bear favourable comparison with that of London generally, which was at the rate of 24 per 1000, whilst that of Lambeth was 23 per 1000. The most healthy districts were as usual those of Brixton, Kennington (1st and 2nd parts), and Norwood; as regards Brixton, a casual observer would be startled at finding that the Death Rate as it appears in the Registrar General's Returns, gives a mortality of 37.34 per 1000 per annum, which if it were actually the case would end in a rapid extinction of the inhabitants of that district, the deaths being 198 more than the births; but on carefully looking into the matter we find that the deaths at the Stockwell Hospital account for this high rate of mortality, 13 as the Deaths in that Institution amounted to 663, of which 470 were entire strangers to the district, deducting these, we find that the Death rate of Brixton stands as low as 18.90 per. 1000. The less healthy districts were Waterloo Road 1st and 2nd parts, and Lambeth 1st and 2nd Church. As regards the apparent increased Mortality of Lambeth 1st Church, the same explanation is applicable as in the case of Brixton, namely, the existence this year of a large Public Institution which was not there the previous year, viz., St. Thomas's Hospital, in which there have occurred 216 Deaths, 130 of these were strangers, and after deducting these from the Total Deaths in Lambeth 1st Church, it will bear most favourable comparison with the other districts of the Inner Liberties. The Deaths from Epidemic Diseases during 1871 are shown in Table 3, they amounted to 1750 and were 31.4 per 1000 of the entire mortality; in the previous year they were 24.25 per 1000. The Epidemic of Small Pox was the chief cause of the increased Mortality. Table 1 shows the number of cases of Zymotic Diseases treated by the Poor Law Medical Officer during each quarter of the year. The total numbers were 1540 of which 480 occurred in the first quarter, 587 in the second quarter, 274 in the third quarter, and 208 in the fourth quarter. The greatest mortality was from Small Pox, and occurred in the 2nd quarter; the next greatest mortality arose from Diarrhoea and Whooping Cough, in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. The total number of cases of Epidemic Diseases were greater this year than in 1870. The number and character of Nuisances removed and the general sanitary measures carried out, will be seen in Table I. The nuisances abated or removed, amounted to 2430; m addition to these there was a large amount of Sanitary work 14 carried out by Disinfecting houses and rooms where Small Pox and other contagious diseases had occurred. The number of houses Disinfected and cleansed wherein Contagious Diseases existed were 377; 307 houses requiring proper drainage, drained; 43 Cesspools abolished; 309 obstructed drains remedied; 176 defective drains trapped; 383 houses without proper water supply provided with same; 79 houses provided with means of ventilation; 22 houses where dampness and foul smells existed, remedied; 73 yards of houses re-paved; 311 dust bins erected; 137 accumulations of dung, &c., removed; 44 cases of decomposed animal or vegetable matter removed; 16 foul urinals cleansed, removed, or improved; 36 dangerous structures removed; 12 trade nuisances removed; 56 lots of swine, consisting of 234 pigs, removed ; 12 lots of unwholesome fish of various descriptions, condemned and destroyed; 3 cases of unwholesome meat, consisting of 34½lbs., and 82 rabbits, condemned and destroyed; 3 cases of illegal slaughtering of sheep, in which the parties offending were fined; 93 cases in which articles of bed and bedding, infected with contagious diseases wore burnt; 4 cases of smoke nuisances abated. In one case the magistrate sentenced the offender to 3 months imprisonment with hard labour, and in another, there was a penalty of £10 inflicted; in both cases for exposing unwholesome meat for sale. In addition to the above, 1514 houses have been disinfected in which Small Pox and other contagious diseases existed, and various sanitary improvements effected therein, such as cleansing, lime washing, papering and painting, proper means of ventilation provided, water supply to houses and closets, (where deficient,) laid on, yards repaved and drained, and defective drainage remedied. In order to complete these necessary works, 2831 notices were required to be served, and 64 Summonses and Orders issued. 15 The number of Licensed Slaughterhouses visited were 104, Cow houses 95, and Bakehouses 221, in all of which the usual Periodical cleansing and whitewashing was enforced, and many other improvements effected. The Epidemic of Small Pox which commenced in London in the summer of 1870, and was at its height in the autumn of 1871, but which I am happy to say is now, whilst these pages are patting through the press, (Sept. 1872) almost entirely extinct; has been one of the most alarming and expensive epidemics that have visited the country for a century. The cost in a pecuniary sense has been great; but it is nothing as compared to the cost of human life, and I trust that the lessons taught by this Epidemic will not be forgotten; of all the Zymotic Contagious Diseases, this is the most loathsome; but at the same time I know of no Disease that can be made so preventible as this— by intent compulsory vaccination, and re-vaccina- tion, after the age of puberty of all classes of the community: it was to the neglect of this sanitary measure that we may attribute the sad sacrifice we have had of both life and money. A very Vauable report has just been issued by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District, which affords to my mind the strongest confirmation of the value of vaccination as a means, if not of preventing the disease, of preventing death from Small Pox. The report would occupy too much space for me to quote at any length, however, one paragraph relating to re-vaccination is so valuable that I have inserted it. The necessity of re-vaccination when the protective power of the primary vaccination has to a great extent passed away, cannot be too strongly urged. No greater argument to prove the efficacy of this precaution can be adduced than the fact that out of upwards of 14,800 cases received into the Hospitals only 4 will authenticate cases were treated in which re-vaccination has 16 been properly performed, and these were light attacks. Further conclusive evidence is afforded by the fact that all the Nurses and Servants of the Hospitals, to the number at one time of upwards of 300, who are hourly brought into the most intimate contact with the Disease, who constantly breathe its atmosphere, and than whom none can be more exposed to its contagion, have, with but few exceptions, enjoyed complete immunity from its attacks. These exceptions were cases of Nurses and Servants whose revaccination in the pressure of the epidemic was overlooked, and who speedily took the disease, and one case was that of a nurse, who having had Small Pox previously, was not re-vaccinated, and took the disease a second time." The following, which appeared in the" British Medical Journal,'' of September 21st, 1872, gives a further convincing proof of the efficacy of re-vaccination: "According to a statement made at the Statistical Congress held this year in St. Petersburgh, the total number of Deaths from Small Pox in the German Army during the recent FrancoGerman War was 263. This small mortality is attributed to the system of compulsory re-vaccination, which every man who enters the army must undergo. On the other hand, in the French Army, where re-vaccination is not compulsory, the number of deaths, as stated by a French authority was 23,409. This terrible difference (says the Wiener Mcdizin Wocheuschr) must puzzle the greatest opponents of Yaccination." In conclusion, therefore, I would urge upon those authorities who have the power to enforce the salutary and preventive measure of vaccination and re-vaccination, to take such steps now that the Disease has almost ceased to exist among us, as will prevent its recurrence as an Epidemic. True economy consists in the prevention more than in the treatment of Disease. TABLE I.
