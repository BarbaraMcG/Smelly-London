The numbers for the preceding five years were 663, 656, 628, 624, and 707- 321 deaths took place at and above 60, including 43 at and above 80; the corresponding numbers for the preceding year being 318, and 50. 311 deaths arose from Tubercular or Consumptive diseases, against 279 in 1861. 266 deaths arose from Pulmonary diseases, against 284 in 1861. 172 deaths took place in the Workhouse; 106 being those of males, and 66 of females. The number was 120 in 1859; 137 in 1860, and 160 in 1861. 16 deaths occurred in the House of Correction; and 2 in the House of Detention. The accidental deaths were 23, against 17 in 1861. Of these, 11 arose from the suffocation of Infants; 1 from choking by food; 4 from burns and scalds; 1 from the administration of syrup of poppies by a female; 3 from children being run over; and 3 from other injui-ies. On reviewing the above data, it is seen that the mortality of the district during the past year has increased; the deaths having been 78 more than in the preceding year, and 126 more than the average of the last 10 years. 15 The deaths from Epidemic or Zymotic diseases have increased by 41, the total number being 422; nearly three-fourths of these occurring in infants and children under 5 years of age. The deaths from the principal, or most fatal of these diseases, have also increased by 35, the total number being 375; more than threefourths of which occurred in children under 5. The deaths from other than Zymotic diseases increased by 37. Hence the proportional increase of deaths from Zymotic diseases has been greater than that from the other classes of diseases. During the early part of the year, a severe form of Typhus prevailed extensively in the district. The principal mortality from this disease affected in greater proportion those of more advanced age; for 15 out of 79 only were under 5 years of age. A virulent form of Scarlet Fever was also very prevalent during the year; increasing the mortality from this disease, which was already high, by 38 deaths. The Epidemic or Zymotic diseases are those specially amenable to sanitary measures, and therefore deserves the attentive consideration of the Vestry, There are two main points to be regarded in respect to them, viz.: their origin and diffusion, and their consequence—the large mortality. Very little attention is paid to the former. In fact, the most reckless indifference exists generally among the poorer classes as to the spreading of these diseases. Children barely recovering from them are allowed to mix freely with healthy children, and are often sent to school, to propagate the disease there also. And mothers with infants in their arms are daily seen in rooms containing those who are suffering, to convey home the infection and to diffuse it among the members of their own family. Moreover in the case of the poorer classes, there is too much indifference to cleanliness. But with these matters the Vestry have little power to interfere. The next most potent cause of the diffusion and fatality of these diseases, is the overcrowding, and the occupation of single rooms by entire families. When these conditions exist, it is impossible to prevent the spread of an infectious disease ; and the sufferers exist under the most unfavorable circumstances for ensuring a harmless attack, often 3, 4, or 5 of them being confined in one small room. This evil has been but little interfered with, for the reason, and which appears to have foundation, that if the occupation of rooms throughout the district were regulated, there would not be sufficient accommodation for the inhabitants. Notwithstanding the existence of these unfavorable sanitary conditions in the district, which tend to induce a heavy mortality, the latter cannot be solely attributed to this cause ; for the Zymotic diseases which have prevailed so extensively in this district, have also prevailed largely in the Metropolis generally. Thus, these diseases, which produced 15,710 deaths in 1861, caused 17,869 deaths in 1862; and all those Zymotic diseases which have been more fatal in this district, have also been more fatal in the metropolis. 10 tlence the mortality of this district is ititimately related to that &F the metropolis. If the mortality from these diseases in this district tad occurred at the same rate as that of the metropolis, 418 deaths would have taken place from them, instead of 422—the actual number. This relation, however, should rather be viewed in regard to the diffusion of the diseases, than to their fatality ; for undoubtedly the free intercourse taking place between the inhabitants of all parts of the metropolis, is a potent cause of the diffusion of Zymotic diseases; while the resulting mortality will depend mainly upon the local sanitary conditions of the particular districts. Slaughter-houses.—The slaughter-houses, -which were 45 in number, kept by 43 butchers, were inspected by the Sanitary Committee in conjunction with myself, and the necessary improvements ordered and carried out, prior to the granting of the licenses. There is little complaint to be made of the condition of the slaughter-houses in the district generally ; yet in a certain number of instances, the entrance to them is through the shop, and so through the house. Hence the cattle and sheep have to be driven over the pavement; and there is great difficulty in making the animals enter a door to which there is no roadway. It is to be hoped, that when the new meat-market is established, those butchers who have not a proper entrance to the slaughter- house, will give up the slaughteiing of animals ; and if they do not do so. their licenses should be opposed, as the nuisance arising from driving animals across the pavement is great, and attended with danger to the foot passengers. Cow-Houses.—The passing of the "Metropolis Local Management Acts Amendment" in August of the year, made requisite the licensing of the cow-houses, which were consequently inspected by the Sanitary Committee with myself. The cow-houses were 31 in number, kept by 26 cow-beepers; and the number of cows contained in them was 620. A few of them being in an unsatisfactory condition, opposition was made at the Special Sessions to their being licensed. The magistrates however decided, that as the Act had so recently come into force, no opposition would be admitted ; with the understanding, that if the improvements required by the Vestry were not effected before the next licensing day, the licenses would be refused. Sanitary Improvements.—The following sanitary improvements were effected during the year: 838 feet of sewers were constructed; 62 sewers were cleansed and repaired, 186 loads of soil having been removed from them; 39 house-drains were laid down; 61 houses were drained; and 76 cesspools destroyed and water-closets substituted for them. Two drinking fountains were also erected. 17 The following table expresses the meteorology of the year. Temperature, mean. Difference from average of 21 years. Dew-point. Hnmidity.
