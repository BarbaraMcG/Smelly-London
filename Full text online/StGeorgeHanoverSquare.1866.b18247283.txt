No. XXXIV.] HA-N16 QUARTERLY SUMMARY of the SICKNESS AND MORTALITY IN THE PARISH of Saint George, hanober Square, and of THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, for the QUARTER ENDED 31st MARCH, 1866. WITH REPORT FOR THE YEAR. honbor: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. TO THE Vestrnof St. George, hanober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, We have the satisfaction, this quarter, of presenting a Mortality Table, which is far less unfavourable than those which it has been our duty to draw up for the corresponding quarters of some foregoing years. Thus let us take the first quarters of the years— Total deaths, in whole Parish. Hanover and Mayfair. Mount Street Workhouse. Belgrave. Zymotic. Lung and Phthisis. Under 5. Over 60. 1857 . 436 137 14 206 74 151 142 115 1858 . 528 163 21 254 110 195 181 106 1859 . 457 116 23 235 85 140 171 100 1860 . 547 140 14 288 80 199 202 118 1861 . 540 133 31 273 74 201 160 146 1862 . 609 129 25 358 116 183 239 123 1863 . 553 140 23 298 136 140 220 110 1864 . 604 169 38 300 75 214 167 178 1865 . 607 187 31 297 97 189 195 154 1866 . 550 115 26 307 85 176 182 135 We see that we have, in the gross, not lost so many lives as last year by 57, and that the saving depends on the marvellous healthiness of the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, and especially their exemption from epidemic disease. The number 550 includes 70 deaths of strangers in St. George's 4 Hospital, which is rather above the average, and 10 in the Little Chelsea Workhouse. If we look at the details we find no death from smallpox; from measles 20 children died, of whom one only resided in the Hanover Sub-District, viz., in South Moltonstreet; the remaining 19 were scattered over the Belgrave Sub-District,—for instance, in Whitaker, Cambridge, Stanley, King, Queen, Sutherland, Westmoreland, Charlwood, Minera, Westbourne, Warwick, and Hanover streets;—Cambridgeterrace; Royal-mews, Chester mews, Wallis's-yard, St. Michael's-schools, Wilton-road, and Brewer's-place. From scarlatina, there were 8 deaths:—two in the Hanover, viz., in Oxford-street and in North Bruton-mews; six in the Belgrave Sub-District, viz., in Lupus, Gillingham, and Pont streets, and two in one house in Denbigh-place. The deaths from diphtheria, croup, and sore throat were also eight, from whooping-cough thirteen, and out of the whooping-cough cases, six occurred in the Hanover Sub-District. Out of the foregoing 49 deaths, one only was of a person above 20; almost all the rest were of mere babies under 5 ; but our next item of fever, in its several varieties, is fatal to all ages alike, and especially to persons advanced in life. Thus of the 17 deaths from " fever," 8 were deaths of persons under 20, and nine above. A boy of 9 died in Thomas-street, in the Hanover Sub-District (he had come there ill), and a boy of 6 in Shepherd's-court, Upper Brook-street;—a boy of 3 at Johnson's-place, one of 2 in Bridge-row, a boy of 4 and girl of 9 in one house in Berwick-street, and a girl of 17 in Tachbrook-street. But grievous as these deaths of children are, it is still more grievous to think of young men in the prime of life and usefulness—as a barrister of 27 in Bolton-row, the son of a physician, aged 20, in Brook-street, a groom of 40 in Belgrave-mews, a journeyman coachmaker of 23 in Hindon-street, a footman in Wilton-place, a mechanic of 5 53 in Brown-street, one of 58 in Glasgow-terrace, and one of 56 in Rutland-street, besides two strangers in the Hospital. Domestic servants, who live and sleep in the basements of houses and are there exposed to unusual quantities of sewer vapour, are entitled to the protection afforded them by inspection of premises in which they have become ill. It may be added in taking leave of "fever," that some cases included under the head may be of doubtful nature ; and that in some of the cases before us the disease was contracted out of our parish. The two deaths from diarrhoea were those of young infants, arising probably from unwholesome food; so were two of the cases of dysentery; the others were chronic cases in persons who had been in hot climates. Six persons are returned as having died of the effects of intoxicating liquors; such persons are usually coachmen or male domestic servants, or potboys, or mechanics' wives. The number of persons who died of consumption, scrofula, tabes mesenterica, brain disease of children, teething, premature birth, atrophy and debility was 130, and the number from accident, negligence, and other moral causes 25. Amongst the accidents are the deaths of three aged women who died by falling down stairs; of an infant of 18 months, who was let fall on its head; an engineer aged 18, who fell through a skylight, whilst removing snow from a roof, and divided his brachial artery and bled to death; a carman of 37, who fell from a van at Surbiton; a groom of '25, whose skull was fractured against a lamp-post by a runaway horse; a cowkeeper of 19 thrown down by a horse he was trying to stop ; a boy of 18 drawn into steam machinery and crushed; a man of 57, whose finger was crushed in a cog-wheel; a man of 40, who died of locked jaw, after injuring his thumb; a railway shunter crushed by a waggon, and a fireman crushed in uncoupling his engine ; a man of 37, whose skull - was fractured by a fly-wheel; a labourer, whose leg was 6 jured by an iron bar; and a boy who was drawing a truck which was upset by a waggon, and inflicted a wound in the thigh. One of them suffered amputation, and four died of superadded pyæmia—the name of a state of subtle blood poisoning which ensues; when the vapours or decomposing discharges of the patient's own wounds, or the general foul air of the hospital, enter the blood, and set up fever and abscesses from which the patient rarely recovers. There were four deaths from burns also of children whose " clothes ignited at a grate," or who set themselves on fire whilst reaching things from the mantelpiece. One boy of 6 was drowned whilst playing on the banks of the Thames—one infant suffocated in bed with its parents. Of suicides there were two; one by poison, one by hanging. There remain to be mentioned the deaths of two infants, under the head of " causes not specified or ill defined "—one found in Hyde Park, and another on a doorstep in Halkin-street; besides one newly-born babe found in a garden in Grosvenorplace, and declared to have been murdered. But these are not the only victims of poverty, carelessness, ignorance, and other bad moral conditions. There is many a child, week after week, registered as having died of some disease with a learned name, but which we know really to have been let die of neglect. In such cases trivial ailments assume new and dangerous proportions. Thus we have one infant dying of bad eyes, another of three weeks dying of sloughing and ulceration of the right pectoral muscles; the child of a " general servant," aged 3 months, found dead in bed from want of nourishment; and two infants dying of congenital syphilis. All these facts give evidence of what we say in our Annual Report, year after year, that the mortality of a parish is not merely an affair of unhealthy site, or of infectious disease, but of frugality, possession of intelligence 7 and property, and love of life, or, the reverse, in the in habitants. THE SICKNESS. In the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, the number of persons who obtained medical attendance from the Parochial Medical Officers was 305, from the Dispensary Mount-street, 705; and in the Sick Wards of the Workhouse Mount-street, the large number of 220; total, 1230. There were 1 case of small-pox, 1 of chicken-pox, 1 of measles, 3 of scarlatina, 15 of whooping-cough, 9 of diarrhoea, 1 of dysentery, 9 of continued fever, 1 of erysipelas, 352 of bronchitis and catarrh, 3 of diphtheria, 3 of pleurisy, and 3 pneumonia. The case of small-pox was that of a girl named Harriet Fowler, aged 10, sent to the Small-pox Hospital from No. 2, Hart-street; she had been vaccinated in infancy by Mr. Jay. The case of measles occurred in the third week of March, in North-row. The scarlet fever cases were those of a child in North Bruton-mews, fatal; and 2 children living with their mother in an empty house in John-street, Berkeley-square. The black feature in this list are the cases of continued fever, of which one in Brown-street, and one in Shepherd'scourt, proved fatal. The others occurred in Grosvenormarket, Thomas-street, John's-court, Hart-street, and Mountrow. Besides these, there were sent to the Fever Hospital, 12th January, 1866, Honorah Dowling, tramp; 29th January, John Matthews, tramp (transferred to the Small-pox Hospital) ; 17th March, Walter Wiltshire 31, tramp; 29th * March, Emma Smith 40, tramp. There were also sent to the Small-pox Hospital (besides the girl mentioned above)— 1866.—January 20, John Purchardt, aged 25, came from 8 Clapham to St. George's Hospital, sent on to the Workhouse, thence to Small-pox Hospital. March 19, Elizabeth B., aged 45, servant at a hotel near Piccadilly. John Haines, aged 14 months, came ill with his mother, a tramp, to the Workhouse. sickness in the belgrave sub-district. In the Belgrave Sub-District 6,931 persons were treated by the parochial surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these 3,897 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 3,034. The total figures include 13 of small-pox, 8 of chickenpox, 111 of measles, 30 of scarlet fever, 52 of whooping-cough, 107 of diarrhoea, 4 of dysentery, 23 of continued fever, 15 of rheumatic fever, 15 of erysipelas, 3 of diphtheria, and 4 of carbuncle. There were 645 cases of bronchitis, 11 of pleurisy, and 141 of pneumonia. The following are the particulars of the cases of small-pox, namely: At No. 19, Hindon-street-Mary Anne Prince, vaccinated. At No. 6, Warwick-place West—Joseph Curry, set. 26, vaccinated. Sent to the Small-pox Hospital. At No. 2, Robert's-buildings—Alice Marshall, vaccinated. Removed to the Small-pox Hospital. There was sent to the Fever Hospital on 29th February— Charles Philips, set. 13,14 Cumberland-street. C. J. B. Aldis, M.D., R. Druitt. 9 APPENDIX. No. I. WATER.

No. IE. special cases. Nuisance from a Cracked Oven.—In this case the owner of No. 2, Hertford-street, complained of a most offensive smell pervading the lower part of the house at various times, and particularly in the evening, on days when a large number of game pies were being baked for a cook in the neighbourhood. The oven had been cracked some time ago, in consequence of the settlement of an old sewer that ran under the house; 12 hence the vapours from it passed through crevices in the brickwork into the front vaults, kitchen, and parlour of the adjoining house. The oven was repaired, and the nuisance, which was really a serious one, abated. Drainage of Dover-street.—An old sewer much out of repair ran under the front vaults of three or four of the houses at the lower end of this street. This had been burrowed by rats; there were also in some of the vaults some offensive water-closets, and some sinks without traps. These nuisances were explored and remedied by Mr. Grant, and at the same time a new sewer was constructed along a certain part of the street, which was without one, so that the drainage of the street is now perfect. Drainage of Derby-street.—A similar state of things existed in this street. The public sewer did not run the entire length, and the drainage of some of the houses was received into a small brick drain running under the front vaults. This had become choked or dilapidated, and there was no outlet for the sewerage of some of the houses, whilst offensive water was apt to ooze up into the basements. Nuisance in New Bond-street.—A singular nuisance was discovered and got rid of here by Mr. Grant. An old watercloset had been removed from the vault of a poulterer's, and an old brick drain leading into the sewer left open and unprotected, an example of recklessness unluckily by no means rare ; up this opening rats used to come, and to take feathers and garbage from the poulterer's and stow them away in immense quantities between the floor of the shop next door and the ceiling of the kitchen beneath it. No. Thomas-street.—Here an unseemly state of overcrowding was put an end to by Mr. Grant. Two grown-up sisters and a brother slept in one kitchen, and a father, mother, two grown-up sons, and a girl of 12 in another. Nos. 24, 25, and 26, Stockbridge-terrace, Pimlico.—The 13 drainage in the front areas obstructed, and the bakehouse of No. 25 flooded with offensive water. The obstruction has been removed. Betts's Slaughter-house, Kinnerton-street.—Mr. Betts, having lost his license for slaughtering at the Petty Sessions, held at Mount-street on October 13th, 1865, on the grounds of negligence in the removal of the offal after a caution given to him, appealed against the decision of the magistrates at the Session House, Westminster, on January 20th, 1866, when, after hearing the evidence, the assistant-judge, Mr. Bodkin, said, that such a large question as was involved in the abolition of all slaughter-houses within the Metropolitan area ought to be dealt with by the Legislature, or, at all events, upon a different principle than the justices below had taken of granting a license in one instance and refusing it in another, where the premises actually adjoined. The practice of bringing large droves of cattle into one street and selecting those for Mr. Betts from others belonging to neighbouring butchers was so objectionable, that if it were continued, and the license refused next year, this court would confirm the decision, because they could not believe that it was done without the knowledge and sanction of Mr. Betts. They hope the appellant would take proper steps to suppress the nuisance, and with this caution the license would be granted. Appeal allowed, and license granted. Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, Eaton Cottages, Westbournestreet.—The passage staircase of each house, with the rooms of No. 8 and the ceiling of the front bedroom at No. 9 have been cleansed ; the roofs of Nos. 5 and 9 have been repaired. Nos. 5 to 7, Robert's-buildings, Ebury-square.—The yards were flooded with sewage, which has been removed and the drains cleansed. Eaton-lane North, Belgravia.—Twenty-two houses were found to be in a very unsanitary condition. Ten of them 14 were more or less dirty, in some the drains were obstructed, the water-butts rotten, no water supply to the closets, dustpits out of repair, water supply-pipes broken, taps to ditto out of repair, stagnant water lying in the yards, roofs out of repair, sinks without traps, bed clothes and bedding dirty and offensive, and the pavement in the yards dirty. Similar remarks will apply to the state of Rogers' and Eaton-courts. These places will require a further special report, as they have proved to be the worst that we have recorded. About thirty cartloads of soil have been removed from an old sewer, which was covered with wood, and other improvements have been effected. Spring Grarden-place, Belgravia.—Fourteen houses here were either dirty or dilapidated, and in a similar state to those previously described. The cleansing and whitewashing have been finished. APPENDIX. No. IV. GAS. Seventy-two observations were made during the quarter, upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, in Horseferry-road, Bessboroughstreet, Cambridge-street, and 40, Parliament-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light required by the Act, except on January 24, when the common gas of the Chartered Company produced a light equal to that of 12 sperm candles only at the works; Mr. Trewby, the engineer, attributed this result to the " making a connection with their outlet main from the gas holder." 15 As the companies use a burner for the common gas calculated to give a better light than that generally used by the public, it is very desirable that the illuminating power of the gas, at or near the works, should exceed the standard (the light of 12 sperm candles) required by the Act. The following are the results of experiments which I have made between three different burners, Sugg's being the one which is used by the Gas Companies. No. 1 (Birmingham) burner, No. 2 (Sugg's) burner, and No. 3 (the old iron) burner. 13.27 12.87 26.14 13.07 average on No. 1 burner. 14.12 14.31 28.43 14.21 average on No. 2 burner. 12.36 12.37 24.73 12.36 average on No. 3 burner. No. 1 13.07 No. 3 12.36 71 candles. 16 No. 2 14.21 No. 3 12.36 1.85 candles. No. 1 13.07 No. 2 14.21 1.14 candles. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour the turmeric paper, except on January 9th, 16th, and 24th ; February 16th and 20th, and March 5th, 16th, and 27th, when the common gas of the London Company presented traces of ammonia ; also on January 2nd, 15th, and 25th, February 16th and 20th, when the cannel gas of the Equitable Company presented traces of ammonia. I was unable to test the cannel gas of the London Company on January 16th, because it burned 4-10ths short of five feet. The Chartered Company have succeeded in obtaining an official testing-room for my use, at No. 40, Parliamentstreet. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases:— Chartered. London. Equitable.

Births. The number in the whole parish was 2470. In the years ending March 31st 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 the numbers were . 2165 2288 2300 2119 2498 2411 2412 2452 In the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, the births this year were 696. In the years . . 1858 1859 I860 1861 1863 1868 1864 1865 the numbers were. 660 705 710 656 735 661 694 709 In the Belgrave SubDistrict this year there were 1774 . 1505 1583 1590 1463 1763 1750 1718 1743 Deaths. The gross number in the whole parish has been 2030, whereas in the foregoing 8 years they were . 1768 1838 1837 1769 1965 1882 2054 2015 Gross Death-rate. Estimating the population of the whole parish as 91,500, the gross deathrate was just over 22 per 1000 living. 21.3 21.75 21.4 21.6 22.2 20.9 22.4 22 Excess of Births over Deaths, 440 in the whole parish 397 450 463 350 533 529 358 398 Estimated Population. The rate at which people die per cent. or per thousand, in any given year and in any given place, is calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of persons supposed to be living in that place in that year. Now, the whole population of our Parish increased, between the census of 1851 and that of 1861, from 73,236 to 87,747. This increase is, in round numbers, at the rate of 1,500 per annum ; hence we take for granted that the population in 1858 was 83,000, in 1859 84,500, in 1860 86,000, in 1861 87,500, and so on increasing at the rate of B 18 1,600 per annum till 1864, when we assume that it reached 91,600, and that it has been stationary since. Our reasons for believing that the population is at present stationary are founded on the fact that the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts decreased in population from 33,464 to 32,686 in the ten years 1851-1861. It may be alleged that this decrease may have arisen from the fact that many families of distinction were out of town when the census was made in 1861. But as there is no fresh ground to build upon, and as overcrowding has been systematically opposed, and as the number of births gives no reason for supposing any material increase, we believe we are warranted in treating the population of these Sub-Districts as virtually stationary, since 1851, at 32,500 or 33,000. But if the Hanover and Mayfair SubDistricts were stationary, the increase of 1,500 per annum must have taken place in the two wards of the Belgrave Sub-District; and we can show that- this increase continued, and especially in the ouf-ward or South Belgravia, till the middle of 1864. The following list of the number of premises rated to the relief of the poor in the various wards of the Parish during the last eleven years will show this:— Number of Ratings in the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square, in the following years :— 1855 1856 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 Dover Ward 383 385 385 379 379 380 391 391 389 389 389 389 Conluit Ward . 616 619 619 614 618 618 618 618 618 613 613 619 Grosvenor Ward. 844 843 842 840 840 839 838 838 838 838 838 839 Brook Ward 1080 1078 1078 1076 1075 1074 1077 1080 1080 1082 1082 1080 Curzon Ward . 712 712 713 712 712 715 725 722 716 716 716 718 Knightsbridge Ward 2461 2440 2446 2456 2468 2470 2478 2489 2497 2501 2505 2506 Out-Ward 8554 3668 3729 3770 3897 3988 4181 4310 4459 4600 4636 4578 9650 9745 9812 9847 9989 10084 10508 : 10451 10597 10739 10779 : 10729 The facts are obvious. The land for fresh buildings in the outward is so nearly exhausted that the increase of houses is more than balanced by the extensive demolitions which have been made, partly for the sake of erecting new and still unfinished houses on old sites, and partly to make room for the metropolitan railways. Last year we presented to the Vestry a list of 204 houses, in the vicinity of the Victoria Railway-station, which had been pulled down or were marked for destruction. These houses (as we ascertained from the census record of 1861, most kindly put at our disposal by the Registrar-General) contained 371 families of 820 male and 998 female inmates—total, 1818—including 474 children under 15. Since that time, still more extensive demolitions have taken place on sites not yet rebuilt.* * Ninety-five premises are now, or shortly will be, pulled down for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, and 35 for the Metropolitan District Railway. Several tenements in Hanover-plase, in Oxford-street, and in Hereford-street and North-row, are rebuilding; besides Grosvenor-place, S.W. 19 Now let us turn to the Mortality and Death-Rate of Hanover and Mayfair. In these Sub-Districts the gross number of deaths, that is including all in the workhouse, in the year ended 31st March, 1866, was 553 ; in the years 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 563 605 543 567 534 570 577 630 612 The gross death-rate of this part of the Parish therefore this year has been 17 ; and has fluctuated, during the last eight years, between 16 and 19 per 1,000 per annum, estimating the population as virtually stationary at 32,500. Division into Rich and Poor Streets and Mews. Rich Streets. We now proceed, as in former reports, to divide the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts into two classes of streets. First, the aristocratic and first-class business streets and squares, such as Albemarle and Arlington streets, North and South Audley streets, Grosvenor and Berkeley squares, Old and New Bond streets, Bolton, Brook and Bruton streets, &c., &c. We obtained an exact record of the population of these streets at the census of 1851, and we believe there has been no material fluctuation since; the population of these streets was then 20,000. The deaths in them last year were 178, or at the rate of 8-9 per 1,000 of the Dormlation. Out of the 178, the number of children s deaths under 5, was 44. In the foregoing years, the numbers were : 1858 1859 I860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 Total Deaths 216 209 192 201 187 201 240 218 Under Five 43 41 39 41 Poorer Streets. Now if we take the second and third-class business streets, the mews, and the streets occupied by the artisan and servant classes,—such as Adam's-mews, Avery-row, Barlowmews, Bell-yard, &c., &c.—the population of these is 12,500, say 13,000. The total number of persons who died at home in these streets last year, excluding all that died in the workhouse or in the hospital, and 7 that were found in the park or streets, is 280, of whom 136 were children under 5, or nearly one-half. Therate of persons who died at home is 21.7 per 1,000. 1857 1858 1859 I860 1861 1862 1868 1864 1865 Total Deaths 251 293 269 279 241 303 258 273 266 Under Five 136 119 154 121 123 123 There is a class of dwellings called Mf.ws, in which the families of coachmen and grooms live over stables. These are usually considered more unwholesome than the ordinary artisan's home, because of the ammonia evolved from the horse manure. In our Parish, however, the stables are very well looked after, and the increased space which the residents enjoy is more than a 20 pensation for the ammonia. The population of the mews in the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, was 3,000 in 1851, and cannot have greatly altered since ; the deaths last year were Of 24 adults and 28 children under 5, total 52, or at the rate of 17.3 per 1,000 per annum. Thus far we have spoken of the gross mortality of the Tarish at large, and of the deaths at home, in the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts ; now let us speak of Deaths in Institutions. Year ending 31st March, 1866,— 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1868 1864 1866 Deaths in St. George's Hospital, 352 311 314 316 330 808 317 328 336 Non-parishioners who died there, 271 255 251 243 263 243 253 260 264 Parishioners who died there, 81 56 63 73 67 65 64 61 72 From the Hanover and Mayfair Sub - Districts, 19 — — 24 27 22 19 17 21 From the Belgrave, 62 — — 49 40 43 45 44 51 Deaths in Mount-street Workhouse, 88 88 75 72 96 69 100 104 112 Deaths in Little Chelsea Workhouse, 23 41 33 28 25 27 26 36 24 When we speak of deaths at home, it must be understood that we speak of those who die in their own beds. This year, 19 of the inhabitants of the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts died in St. George's Hospital. As we have said before, if we take the 88 parishioners who died in the Mount-street, and 23 in the Little Chelsea Workhouse, and the 82 in the Hospital—total 193—we see that nearly one-tenth of the deaths in our Parish took place in beds provided by charity. Mortality in Belgrave Sub-District. The gross number of deaths in this Sub-District (that is, including all the 352 deaths in the Hospital) was 1,454. In the 8 foregoing years it was 1858 1859 I860 1861 1862 1868 1864 1865 1124 1262 1242 1210 1368 1279 '.388 1381 Estimating the population to be stationary at the calculated amount of last year, 59,500 or 60,000, the gross rate of mortality was about 24 per 1,000. Excluding the deaths in St. George's Hospital and Workhouses, the people who died at home, were 1,102, or at the rate of 18 3 per 1,000 living.

But we have some which enables us to contrast the mortality of the richer and poorer classes, to a certain extent. For this purpose we have taken 5 squares, which belong, par excellence, to the wealthy classes, and 7 streets which equally belong to the other class.

The rich people live one family in one house. Between 60 and 70 per cent. of the inhabitants of those houses are women—that is, domestic servants —women in the prime of life and health. Children under 15 constitute only about 1 in 8 or 9 of the population. In 5 years they lose 33.5 per thousand of their population by death, or 67 per thousand per annum. Of this number, deaths under 5 are one-ninth of the total deaths. Many of the inmates, if likely to die, are removed elsewhere. On the contrary, the poor people live more than two families in one house; the proportion of the sexes is equal; there are no domestic servants; the number of children under 15 is 35 per cent. The deaths in 5 years are 119 per thousand of their population—that is, 23.8 per thousand per annum—of which the deaths under 5 are 60 per cent. The deaths in the poorer houses must be more numerous, because more of the inhabitants are of the ages at which mortality is highest, and because they have fewer of the resources which make life worth having or possible to have. We now proceed to sum up the deaths from preventible or partially preventible causes in the whole parish. So-called Preventible Causes of Death.

In the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, the total number of cases treated by the Parochial Medical Officers and at the Dispensary, Mount-street, and in the Sick-Wards of the Mountstreet Workhouse, has been 4309. Last year the number was 3732. In 1864 the number was 4450 ; in 1863, 3901; in 1862, 3803. Amongst them were 6 cases of small-pox treated at home, 7 sent to the Small-pox Hospital, and 4 private cases—together, 17, which, with preceding cases, make the entire number known to have occurred in the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts since December 1862, to be 173. There were thirteen cases of chickenpox, 133 of measles, 56 of scarlatina, 28 of whooping-cough, 159 of diarrhoea, 4 of cholera, 60 of fever, 7 of erysipelas, 870 of bronchitis and catarrh, 8 of diphtheria, 6 of pleurisy, 6 of pneumonia. As for the diseases not specified by name in this list, they are of a low sort, as might be expected amongst the class which resorts for gratuitous medical aid, as phthisis, indigestion, and the like. We notice, again with regret, the frequent entries of the itch, as that is really a complaint which ought to be unknown in this Parish, with its baths and washhouses. Sickness in the Belgrave Sub-District. In the Belgrave Sub-District 30,367 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and the Workhouse, Little Chelsea; of these 18,742 were patients at St. George's Hospital. The whole number includes 23 of small-pox, 33 of chicken-pox, 357 of measles, 103 of scarlet fever, 225 of whooping-cough, 753 of diarrhoea, 28 of dysentery, 103 of continued fever, 41 of rheumatic fever, 67 of erysipelas, 11 of diphtheria, and 12 of carbuncle. There were also 2076 cases of bronchitis, 42 of pleurisy, and 139 of pneumonia. Vaccination. In the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts the number of persons vaccinated by Mr. Jay was 234, of whom tho operation was successful in all. The Vaccination Act is a dead letter as regards the registration of Vaccination. From time to time, through the courtesy of Mr. Jay and Mr. J. L. Hughes, the Registrars of the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts, we obtain a list of births amongst the poorer classes, and send round to enquire whether the infants have been vaccinated. The regulations of the Parochial Schools are also a great help, as they detect any failure of Vaccination in children who apply for admittance. Still, virtually, Vaccination is left to the good sense of the people; and the number who apply for vaccination at the public expense, bears a fair proportion to the number of births. 24 Vaccination by Dr. Webb—Belgrave Sub-District.

Clean hands and faces are also insisted on; and in most of the schools the boys are desired to wear a clean shirt collar, a small thing seemingly, but one which has an excellent effect. Sanitary Work. The Quarterly Reports show that the number of complaints entered in the Inspector's Report Book, between April 1st, 1865, and April 4th, 1866, is 626, of which 242 relate to premises in the Hanover and Mayfair, and 384 in the Belgrave Sub-District. But inasmuch as one complaint may refer to more than one house or set of premises, it must be added that the number of premises complained of has been 306 in the Hanover and Mayfair, and 613 in the Belgrave,—total 919. The number of notices served has been 141; of which 44 referred to the Hanover and Mayfair, and 97 to the Belgrave. The number of cases in which legal proceedings have been taken is 12, of which 7 refer to the former, and 5 to the latter Sub-District. List of Improvements. The Sanitary Improvements in the Parish, between April 2nd, 1865, and March 31st, 1866, inclusive, are shown in the following Table, compiled from the Nuisances' Complaint Book, kept by Mr. Grant:— Dwelling Houses. No. of cases.

In consequence of a letter, alleging that the workroom and sleeping rooms of a milliner in extensive business were overcrowded and improperly ventilated, we called on the milliner with Mr. Grant, and informed him of the complaint. We were immediately invited to inspect the whole house from top to bottom, which we did, and were gratified at finding that there was no foundation for the complaint. Pains had been taken to ventilate the workroom, and the sleeping apartments were wholesome and comfortable. Visitation of Bakehouses. Twice a year, in company with Mr. Grant, we inspect every bakehouse in the Parish, whether it belong to baker, cook, or confectioner. Of bakehouses in the Hanover and Mayfair SubDistricts there are now 36, one of which, however, is rebuilding, and one shut up and disused soon after Easter. In the Belgrave there are 54 Enquiries and inspections are made, as directed by the Bakehouses Regulation Act, as to the general state of cleanliness and repair;—whether limewashing has been done at the time prescribed by the Sanitary Committee; whether there be any sleeping apartments too closely adjoining, and not properly separated from, the bakehouse; whether boys are employed in nightwork; and whether all sinks, closets, &c., through which sewer air could enter the bakehouse, are in proper order. The result of the investigation was thoroughly satisfactory, and if we are obliged to state that some of the bakehouses had not been limewashed within the time prescribed, still we must add that they were not dirty, and that the omission was through inadvertence. It may be of interest to remark that the machine for * In one instance twelve dogs were removed. 28 bread-making is found too hard to be worked by hand-labour, and is given up by most bakors. One firm has set up a small steam engine. Visitation of Slaughter-houses. A short time before the Petty Sessions appointed for granting licenses to cow-sheds and slaughter-houses, we make a systematic visitation of each, in company with the Inspector. With regard to the slaughter-houses, we see that they are clean, well paved with good firm stones bedded in cement, so that no blood shall soak through the joints; there must be a good water supply, sinks well tapped, and proper receptacles for the blood and garbage ; and it is understood that the latter shall be removed in closed receptacles daily between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. At the last Petty Sessions in October there were applications for licenses of 33 premises, of which one was refused, but subsequently granted by the Justices at the Quarter Sessions, to which appeal was made. This case is noticed at page 13. The custom of having slaughter-houses in towns is clearly dying out of itself. There are now only 33 licensed, whereas there were 43 in 1858 and 39 in 1859. Of the 33, four have been given up since the licensing day, either because the licensee has given up business, or because the premises have been absorbed by railways. Of the others, five are virtually disused, although the owner keeps the license, in order to avail himself of it in case of need. In a former Report (No. v.) we entered into some few particulars as to the principles of scientific butchery. We showed that the transporting live beasts by railway, and then driving them through the streets of a town was a process intrinsically wasteful; inasmuch as the value of the flesh was diminished, and the carrying the offal out of town was an additional source of expense. But the practical reason assigned by the butchers for keeping up the custom is the difficulty of ensuring that meat killed at a distance shall reach the consumer fresh; hence, that it avoids a still greater waste. This difficulty might be overcome by a careful scientific attention to the killing, the handling, the cooling, and the packing; and as some of the best butchers kill no meat of their own, we must suppose that the difficulty of getting good country-killed meat must be decreasing year by year. It is not, however, for us to be made the instruments of any unfair or harsh construction of the law in order to put down town slaughter-houses We find that the experience of many individual butchers, who clamoured strongly for them at first, now shows that they can be dispensed with. Still the law permits them. The owners are industrious, cleanly, and respectable ratepayers, who allege that they secure better meat, and better looking meat, and that they are able to supply meat more cheaply to their customers when they kill it at home, than when they buy it in the dead meat-market. Clearly, then, if the use of slaughter-houses is lawful, and (in the opinion of persona who 29 ought to understand their own business) beneficial, it is our duty solely to protect the health of the parish to the utmost. We believe that they have been kept during the last ten years in the most innocuous state, with the exception of two or three instances of carelessness, which have been punished with loss of the license. We have visited these places at all hours, and are certain that with care they can be kept sweet, and that they are so. We have been accompanied by physicians from Scotland, Ireland, the Continent, and America, who have from time to time come to see how sanitary affairs are managed in this Parish ; and can aver that though we desire them abolished, especially in order to decrease the street traffic, the health of our parishioners is in no danger whatever from them. We may add that it were desirable to have special licenses for killing sheep and pigs, which gives rise to far less nuisance than the killing of oxen. Cow-yards, Catlle Plague, &c. In October 1862, the number of cow-yards in the Parish was 18, belonging to 21 proprietors, and the number of the animals 477. In 1865 the number was 18 (of which one only is in the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts), and at the beginning of August 1865, the number of cows was about 400. The accommodation in the various sheds allowed of about 600, but the number was always fluctuating. With regard to the condition of the yards, they were for the most part well kept and clean. One of the largest cow-keepers, however, who had two yards, always contrived that they should be crowded and untidy, in spite of all remonstrance. Then came the Cattle Plague. According to official returns, in the week ending August 12th, 4 cows were attacked and killed; in the week ending Aug. 19, 20 attacked, 7 died, 11 killed, besides 21 others killed as probably infected. Week ending August 26th, 13 attacked, 9 died, 5 killed, 83 others slaughtered by way of precaution. Week ending September 2nd, 2 attacked, 1 died ; September 16th, 16 reported to be attacked (what became of these not stated), 3 others slaughtered; week ending October 7th, 4 attacked, 2 killed, 5 others killed by way of precaution; October 14th, 2 attacked, 1 killed, and next week one is reported to have recovered; 1866, Jan. 6, 1 attack, 1 death; Feb. 3rd, 5 attacked, 3 killed, 5 others killed by way of precaution ; Feb. 10th, 2 of the preceding 5 attacked died ; March 31st, 4 attacked, 4 killed.* These statements are taken from the Returns to the Privy Council, but we know that they contain a very inadequate account of the devastation occasioned in the earlier weeks of the Cattle Plague, although, from the secresy maintained by the cow-keepers on a matter which so hazarded their whole means of subsistence, it was perfectly hopeless to obtain anything like an accurate * In week ending April 7th, 2 attacked, 2 killed ; April 14th. 4 attacked. 4 killed, and 22 others slaughtered for precaution. Week ending May 19th, 4 attacked, 3 killed. 1 died, 30 account. The above account does not specify 108 cows belonging to one owner which either were sent away to be killed, or died, or were condemned and slaughtered in little more than a week. The following are believed, however, to be accurate particulars of the case of one cowkeeper. The total number of cows kept was 18, all of which had been housed in the sheds for four months; no diseased or infected cow had been brought there. On October 1 one was ill, but the malady was believed to be pleuro-pneumonia, and the beast was “sent away” at once; very shortly, three more were evidently poorly and were “sent away”; then four were condemned and “sent away as diseased”; one recovered; the remainder were all sold as healthy to butchers. The cow that recovered gave excellent milk throughout the winter, and when her milk ran dry she also was sold to the butchers. At any rate, some effects are pretty certain; three of the best cow-yards are now disused and the number of cows in the Parish at present only about 100. Cow-keeper3, nevertheless, would add to their stock if they dared, because town milk fetches so high a price. The question of town dairies is like that of town slaughterhouses. Can the milk be brought in a sweet state from the country? At present, this question cannot be considered satisfactorily settled. When milk is brought a distance of 50 to 100 miles, that which is delivered to the consumer about three or four in the afternoon has been milked early in the morning, eight, ten or twelve hours before delivery, whilst that which is delivered early in the morning was milked on the previous afternoon, probably fourteen to sixteen hours before consumption. This milk may taste sweet when cold, but is apt to curdle when boiled. For our own parts, looking at the safety of young children during hot weather, we can but hope that a sufficient number of cows will be maintained for the present in town to give them milk sweet, newly milked, and that has not been much shaken. Spite of the outcry against London cow-sheds, and the fact that some may have been kept unwholesomely, there is no doubt but that, on the whole, they contained better cows, better fed and better cared for, which gave better milk daring the nine winter months, than any like number of cows elsewhere. By all means let them bo removed from streets and mews ; but it is clear that they ought, during hot weather, to be within easy distance of the children, for whom their milk is most essential. The Marine Store Dealers. There are 26 in the Parish, all incessantly visited by Mr. Grant, and kept as harmless as their nature admits. Still it were much to be wished that the legislation as to licenses, &c., which has been extended to cow-sheds, slaughter-houses, and bakehouses, could be extended to this business also. Water Analyses. The analyses of the water supplied to the Parish by the Chelsea and Grand Junction Companies, show a uniform, and, on 31 the whole, satisfactory set of results. These waters contain always a certain amount of solid ingredient, the actual quantity of which depends clearly on the weather; for it is least in hot and dry weather, and most in rainy and wintry weather Thus, in writing out the results of a series of analyses by various authorities and by ourselves during the last ten years, the lowest quantity has been in September. Thus, in September 1864, the total solid contents of the Grand Junction water were so low as 14.76 grains per gallon; in June 1859, the Chelsea contained only 14.92; and during the summer generally—as of 1865, for instance—16 or 17 grains per gallon is a fair average. During the winter months it averages from 19 to 2.2; and, in January, 1861, it reached 23. Last October it was 17: in November it jumped to 20, and maintained that average during the winter. So much for total quantity, which is ascertained by evaporating a given measure of water, and drying the residue at 230°. Of this about nineteen-twentieths consist of earthy salts, which make the water hard; and we may say in round numbers, that three-fourths of these earthy salts consist of chalk, which is deposited in the inside of our kettles and boilers, and furs them up and makes them liable to crack. When the water is boiled the chalk first turns the water milky, and then goes to the bottom. About 600 gallons of water would throw down a pound of fur. This chalky matter spoils a good deal of soap, and requires about 2½ its weight of soda to soften the water; but it is quite innocent as a drink; some people think it pleasant, and some beneficial. Besides the earthy matter, the water contains about one grain in the summer, and about a grain and a half per gallon in the winter of matter which can be burned off at a red heat, and in which more refined chemical processes can detect usually about a third of a grain of real organic matter. It is this in which organic poisons lurk if present at all, and which is found in immense quantities in water contaminated with sewage, and especially in the water of the pumps near Mount-street—(See Quarterly Report, No. xxvii., p. 10.) It is highly satisfactory to know that the quantity of organic matter in the Grand Junction and Chelsea waters is on the whole decreasing; and that it is least in the hot season, when sewage contamination might cause cholera, or at least diarrhoea. Still, every family should have a good filter, and drink no water unboiled that is not perfectly bright. Nature of Epidemics—Threatening of Cholera. The nature of epidemics is well seen in the history of the measles so far as they have affected the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-Districts of late. During the quarter ended April 1st, 1865, there was only one case reported amongst the out-door sick poor. Then the disease was absent till the week ended 22nd April, in which there were 2 cases; in the following weeks in succession the numbers were 2, 4, 7, 5, 28, 20, 9, 4, 12, 8, 4, 5, 11, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0,1,0. After this, one case appeared in November, 3 in December, during which months scarlatina prevailed; but there was no case 32 of either in January or February, and one only of measles in March. Thus the diseases of this class come as it were in waves. They seem to be brought in by some definite cause—usually the importation of some person already ill with the disease ; then they spread from one susceptible person to another; but it seems a law of Providence that their power of affecting any individual or the population of any given place is strictly limited in time. This is more especially the case with cholera, whose ordinary duration in any place varies from five to ten weeks. Moreover, there is no doubt but that the matter or substance which constitutes the infectious poison of these diseases lives and thrives in all impurity—in the exhalations from unwashed skins and clothes, in the vapours of the breath condensed in ill-ventilated rooms, in impure water, filthy sinks, drains, closets and sewers, and in refuse offal and garbage wherever they may be found. Hence we are entitled to look on cholera, should the Almighty think fit to send it, as a passing thunder storm; we know that its duration is limited, and we know how to lessen its power of propagation, at least, in this climate, and to a considerable extent. The requisite measures are set forth in a well considered "Memorandum for a plan of uniform action, in case of an epidemic of cholera, by the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health," and in a Report which we have sent to the Sanitary Committee. We have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Yours very obediently, C. J. B. ALDIS, M.D., R. DRUITT. TABLE OF MORTALITY.

HAN 16 No. XXXV.] QUARTERLY SUMMARY OF THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY IN THE PARISH OF Saint George, Hanober Square, AND OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 30th JUNE, 1866. London: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W, TO THE Vestry of St. George, Hanober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, Five hundred and forty-four deaths were registered in the quarter that ended June 30, 1866, whereas in the corresponding quarter of last year, the number was 518. The 544 deaths include 71 of non-parishioners, at St. George's Hospital, and of 10 inmates at the Little Chelsea Workhouse. The weekly average is 41, while that of the preceding ten years is 35.9. By the annexed Table, it will be seen that the increased mortality did not arise from zymotic diseases, but principally from disorders of the respiratory organs. In the quarter ending July 1, 1865, 98 persons died from zymotic disease, whereas in the present period only 67 died from this cause, whilst 93 died of lung disorder. There was 1 death from small-pox, of a girl, aged 6, in Caledonia-street, Pimlico. Of the 16 deaths from measles, one only occurred in the Hanover and May-fair, viz., in Hayes-mews; the others were in the Belgrave, viz., Westmoreland-street, Chelsea-barracks, Whittaker-street, Dorsetmews, Eccleston-street East, Royal-mews, Warwick-street, Passmore-street, Kinnerton-street, and Stanley-place. Scarlet fever was fatal in Pollen-street Hanover-square, Queen-street, and Westmoreland-street. A boy, aged 3, died from 4 theria, in Pulford-street, and 2 girls, each aged 11, in Sutherland-street and Hugh-street respectively. Whooping-cough destroyed 7 children in the Hanover Sub-District; the death of one of these was registered thus:— "11th April, 1866, 5, Hereford-street, Park-lane, M., 3 years, son of a police-serjeant. Pertussis, bronchitis, varicella, variola after vaccination, about eight days." This combination was surely enough to destroy a child! As the whooping-cough, pertussis, is mentioned first, the death is entered under that head, and not under small-pox. There were 5 deaths from croup. One in Unionstreet, Bond-street; another in Hayes-mews; a third in Wilton-terrace; and two in St. George's Hospital of nonparishioners. A boy, aged 2, died from sore throat in Moreton-place. Fever destroyed 5 persons;—a girl, aged 4, in Hertford-place; a boy, aged 5, in Weaver's-place, North-row; a young woman, aged 25, in Bruton-street; a boy, aged 9, in Hanover-street, Pimlico; and a woman, aged 42, in Cambridge-terrace. There were 6 deaths from erysipelas. There were 4 deaths from pyaemia; one in a parishioner, in St George's Hospital, from Upper Ebury-street; and a man, aged 40, died of carbuncle, at the same institution, who came from Effingham-street. An infant died of dysentery in Oxford-street. Diarrhoea proved fatal to 4 persons. One death from choleraic diarrhoea was registered in the first week of June. The patient was the daughter of a physician, in South-street, aged 6 months; healthy till vacciuated, but ever afterwards affected with abscesses, diarrhoea, and other signs of pyaemia, which at last proved fatal. Another in Lupus-street, a third in Wallis's-yard, and a fourth in Sutherland-place. A death from canker happened in Gloucester-street. Diseases of degeneration and ill-development destroyed 5 150 patients, including from premature birth 1.3, teething 6, atrophy and debility 19, water in the head 9, tabes mesenterica 10, convulsions 13, and consumption 80. Lung diseases proved fatal to 93 persons. Among the accidental deaths, there were 11 from fractures and contusions; one of a woman, aged 70, who resided in Ebury-street, and was knocked down by a horse in Elizabeth-street. An infant, aged 1 year and 8 months, had its skull crushed by a cart-wheel running over it in Burton-street, and died in St. George's Hospital. A boy, aged 4, residing in Westbourne-street, died from laceration of the brain, through a fall into a cutting of the Metropolitan Railway works behind Westbourne-street; and a painter, aged 58, from Flask-lane, died from fractured skull, through falling from a scaffold in Grosvenor-place; 8 non-parishioners died from similar causes in the same hospital. One non-parishioner in the hospital died from wounds, and 5 from burns and scalds. The wife of a gardener, aged 51, died from laudanum, at the deputy-ranger's lodge, but it was not proved whether the poison was taken accidentally or by design. A housemaid, aged 16, a woman, aged 60, and a lady's maid, aged 26, were found drowned in the Serpentine, in Hyde Park. A newly-born infant was found murdered on a doorstep in Lower Grosvenor-street. A gentleman, aged 42, residing in Albemarle-street, committed suicide, when insane, by wounding himself in the throat with a razor, and a dispensing assistant, aged 30, from taking prussic acid, in Kensington Gardens. A manservant, aged 24, and a plumber's labourer, aged 47, drowned themselves, when insane, in the Serpentine. The last case of suicide was that of a general servant, aged 25, who hanged herself by a rope to a gas-pipe in an area in Lupusstreet. 6 The case of death from causes not specified or illdefined was that of a newly-born infant, found on the area steps in Westmoreland-street. measures against the cholera. A Special Meeting of the Sanitary Committee was held on May 5th, to consider the subject of preparation against the cholera, at which we stated our belief that there was no occasion for panic or excessive expenditure; that we knew of no undrained houses or cesspools; and that, if such things did exist here and there, it must be in houses of the better class, not of the poor which are regularly inspected. What there is to combat is the state of dirt and neglect, and of wear and tear or wilful destruction of water apparatus, which is sure to be found in all poor houses within three months after they are put to rights, and which would be found three months hence if they were all cleansed now. Besides, desirable as it might be to have all houses cleansed now, there is no law to enforce it. So soon as cholera comes, it will be time to adopt extraordinary measures. There are very few houses which we can swear to be so dirty as to be "nuisances." As these crop up periodically they are cleansed; but any wholesale cleansing must be voluntary, and had better not be done till really wanted, or it will have to be done again. At the same time we handed in a printed "memorandum," containing an abstract of the arrangements to be adopted, both sanitary and medical, in the case of an epidemic. sickness during the quarter. In the Hanover and May-fair Sub-Districts, the number of persons entered on the books of the Parochial Surgeons as out-patients was 335 ; at the Dispensary, Mount-street, 7 721; and in the Sick Wards of the Workhouse, Mountstreet, 180, of whom 45 were tramps; total, 1,136. Besides these, a variable number of casual applicants are relieved, if complaining of diarrhœa, catarrh, and other maladies, but no note is taken of them unless they require further attendance. Amongst these cases, the unusual proportion 295 were of bronchitis and other diseases of the lungs. Two patients with small-pox were entered in the above books, besides two others sent to the Small-pox Hospital, viz.:— April 9, John Dyer, aged three, 30, George-street, not vaccinated; sent to the Small-pox Hospital. April 23, T. Dyer, aged 30, father of the above, vaccinated; sent to the Small-pox Hospital, but sent back for want of room and treated in the Sick Wards, Mount-street. These people came from Chelsea, where the children were born. Two elder children were also unvaccinated, and, as they attended no school, this was not detected. They were vaccinated by Mr. Jay after the outbreak of small-pox in the family, and escaped it. June 16, W. Smith, eighteen, 71, Grosvenor-mews; sent to the Small-pox Hospital. June 18, W. Harris, 25, vaccinated; also sent to the Small-pox Hospital. There were 1 case of chicken-pox, 34 of measles (which this year, as last, began with the warm weather), none of scarlet fever, 30 of whooping-cough, 22 of diarrhœa, 1 of ague, 5 of "fever," 2 erysipelas, 6 delirium tremens, 1 diphtheria (at 9, Robert-street), 2 pleurisy, and 6 pneumonia. There were sent to the Fever Hospital:— April 18, Elizabeth Starbrook, a tramp from the Workhouse; died, 8 June 5, Catherine Regan, a servant, from No. 27, Thomas-street. June 9, Ann Turner, twelve, No. 11, Lancashire court. In the Belgrave Sub-District 8,300 persons were treated by the parochial surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these 5,439 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 2,861. The total figures include 7 of small-pox, 6 of chickenpox, 59 of measles, 21 of scarlet fever, 32 of whooping-cough, 86 of diarrhœa, 7 of dysentery, 15 of continued fever, 21 of rheumatic fever, 7 of erysipelas, 2 of diphtheria, 1 of carbuncle, and 2 of pyæmia. There were 373 cases of bronchitis, 10 of pleurisy, and 55 of pneumonia. The following are the particulars of the 7 cases of smallpox, namely,— No. 5, Eccleston-street East—Agnes Barrell, aged 8; Charles Barrell, aged 1 year and a-half, not vaccinated. No. 2, Wilton-terrace—Sarah Edwards, aged 27, vaccinated. Removed to the Small-pox Hospital. No. 9, Caledonia-street—Catherine Mally, aged 6 years. Died. No. 8, Caledonia-street—Charles Terry, aged 7, vaccinated. No. 44, Hindon-street—James Mills, aged 44; vaccinated in infancy. The seventh was a patient at St. George's Hospital, who came from No. 1, Holland-cottage, Holland-street, Kensington. C. J. B. Alms, M.D., R. Druitt. 9 APPENDIX. No. I. water.

No. III. special cases. Two Houses in Grosvenor-street.—In the Quarterly Summary, No. XXX., was mentioned the case of two contiguous houses, each formerly infested with smells through neglect in the construction of the drains, which had been in great measure remedied. Each house contains a central watercloset on the second floor, drained by a pipe running down in the substance of the party-wall. Last year, the occupant of No. x made fresh complaint of effluvia in his drawingroom, which he believed to enter it at the place where the water-closet pipe of No. y runs down imbedded in the wall. 12 At that time, the water-closet pipe of each house was a mere iron rain-water pipe, with loose joints. We could get no personal evidence of the existence or source of the smell complained of; so we were obliged to tell the complainant that, before we could call on y to pull down the iron pipe within his wall and substitute a leaden one, we must ask him to do the same with his own. This he accordingly did last autumn: and we also advised him to ventilate his drawing-room, which he did not do. This spring he again lodged a formal complaint of effluvia, which he believed to proceed from the same cause as before, and, as the owner of y refused to do anything, it was necessary to investigate the case minutely, with a view to legal proceedings. For this purpose one of the Medical Officers of Health, taking Mr. Grant with him, went to the house by appointment, at 10 a.m., on Monday, the 9th April. Entering the drawingroom, which had been purposely closed for thirty-six hours, they were struck with its exceeding closeness, though this did not seem to differ from that of any other unventilated apartment. They were particularly impressed with the abundance and perfection of the contrivances for keeping out the air. Windows, doors, and the chimney of the adjoining back drawing-room were so carefully padded that it was difficult anywhere to detect a current of air that would move the flame of a taper. On examining the wall at the place where effluvia were complained of, two chinks were detected in the skirting-board, with very slight currents of air coming through them, quite inodorous. A fire was lighted, but made no difference. Four evenings afterwards Dr. D. went to the house, at 10 p.m., after the doors and windows of the room had been kept closed all day, with a good fire, so that the greatest possible suction power might be exerted, and the skirting-board and some of the floor had been removed, so that the wall might be examined more minutely. It had been 13 most elaborately plastered, so as to make it quite impervious to air; except that one crack in the wall was discovered behind the aforesaid cracks in the skirting-board, from which a pretty strong current was blowing, but quite without smell. It is clear from the above that the only evidence to be got was that there was an unventilated room, but that no effluvia could be discovered coming through the well-plastered wall. Nevertheless, moved by the urgent representations of the complainant, the Committee determined, under the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, that the matter should be referred to the magistrate at Marlborough-street, rather than that there should be any allegation of denial of justice. An application was therefore made to Mr. Knox for a summons, to compel the occupier of No. y to pull down the pipe within his wall; but Mr. Knox refused to grant a summons to the local authority, because the evidence adduced by their officers of the existence of a nuisance was insufficient. At the same time, he pointed out that the complainant could apply for a summons himself, without the intervention of the local authority, under the 13th section of the " Amended Nuisances Removal Act, 1860." —Hotel, Albemarle-street.—Complaint of foul smells and of a vast number of rats, proceeding from an old brick drain which had been left when the house was newly drained by pipes. This case is mentioned in illustration of the fact that some of the best streets contain almost_the only thoroughly ill-drained houses in the parish. No. 14, Eccleston-street East, Pimlico.—A small fourroomed cottage, occupied by four families, numbering twenty persons. The overcrowding was in the front parlour, which contained a family of eight persons. The overcrowding was abated. No. 4, Eaton-court.—Complaint that a dead,body was retained here, through the refusal of the medical attendants to 14 give a certificate of death, who alleged as a reason that they wished to make a post-mortem examination. They had attended the deceased for about a year, and admitted that he had disease of the heart; but they were anxious, for the sake of science, to pursue their investigations further. On the other hand, there was danger to the public health, as the widow and child lived in the same room with the dead body. The Registrar, therefore, of the District gave a certificate of death upon his own responsibility, and the body was buried. Cowell's and Betts's Slaughter-houses, Knightsbridge.— A complaint was made by a physician of bad smells from these places coming in at the back windows of the his house when open for ventilation on a particular day, and generally during hot weather; therefore your Medical Officers, Inspector of Nuisances, and the Sanitary Committee visited the premises, but failed to detect any cause for complaint. One of the slaughter-houses (Bett's) has already been the subject of litigation, and the decision of the magistrate was printed in No. XXXIV., page 13. The difficulties in abolishing them consist in their having existed a long time before the neighbouring houses were built, in the fact that smells come from a sewer ventilator and numerous dung-pits close by, and likewise in the fact that the owners have spared no expense in carrying out the suggestions of your Medical Officer, and keep them perfectly clean. Dr. Druitt visited the slaughterhouses, and sent the following letter to Dr. Aldis:— St. George, Hanover Square, Board Room, Mount Street, London, W. 11th May, 1866. Dear Sir, I beg to tell you that I this day inspected the premises of Mr. Betts and of Mr. Cowell, the butchers, of Knightsbridge. I will not trouble you with a detailed description of them, for you are perfectly acquainted with 15 them already, but may say that I found them perfectly sweet, clean, and free from any unpleasant odour, whether in the slaughter-houses themselves or in the sheds in which a few oxen and sheep are kept before being killed. Inasmuch as the slaughtering-places are very near the front shop of each house, it is quite certain that any offensiveness in the slaughter-house would not only be perceived in the shop by the customers, but would probably taint the meat there. It is very unlikely, therefore, that any offensiveness would be permitted by the owners, for their own sakes. I do not uphold the practice of slaughtering in towns, but still the objections brought against that practice ought to be reasonable and true. It is doubtful if injury to health arises from this cause in our parish; and I have smelled more offensive odours, on a summer's morning, from the dust-bins of the houses in Berkeley-square than I ever did from all the slaughter-houses I have inspected. I am, dear Sir, Yours truly, C. J. B. Aldis, Esq., M.D. R. DRUITT. Whilst then, no cause of complaint could be detected in the slaughter-houses, there was plenty nearer home. For with his permission, your Medical Officer and the Inspector of Nuisances examined the condition of the complainant's own house, when they found the trap in the back area perfectly dry, and sewer air escaping freely. The sink in the front kitchen was without a trap: it is true that the grating of a trap was near, but the bell had been knocked off; and the trap in the front area was not properly sealed with water. The water-closet on the landing, near the complainant's bedroom, also contained an untrapped sink. Here were four sufficient causes of bad smell. 16 Roman Catholic Schools, Smith's-place, Pimlico.—The water-closets on the ground floor, with the pipes leading from them, in a defective condition, and a quantity of sewage matter in the vaults under the Schools. A notice was served on April 13th, and the water-closets, with the pipes, have been repaired, the sewage-matter removed from the vaults, and lime thrown down. No. 36, Hanover-street, Pimlico.—The drains of the watercloset obstructed, and the yard flooded with sewage-water. A notice was served on April 11th, and the drains have been cleansed and the sewage-matter removed. No. 13, Brewer-street-.—A large heap of vegetable matter in the yard, and a stable without drainage. A notice was served, on April 14th, for the refuse to be removed daily and for the stable to be properly drained, which has been done. No. 175, Cambridge-street.—A girls' school, where we found obstructed drains, with a quantity of sewage matter in the yard, and were obliged, after notice, to take out a summons and to give evidence before Mr. Arnold, at the Westminster Police-court, who granted an order to abate the nuisance. Allington-street.—Effluvia at Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from being inundated with sewage water, which varied in depth above the floor from 2 to 7 inches. The nuisance had been caused by placing a dam across the sewer in Tachbrookstreet, during the construction of the Metropolitan Extension Railway. When the boards in the kitchen floors of some of the houses were removed, the stench was horrible, and in one the earth was soaked with sewage to the depth of nearly 6 feet. Cow-shed, Brewer-street.—As Mr. Hatt persisted in keeping cows here, although his license had been taken away, a summons was taken out on Wednesday, June 6, 17 and heard on June 13, when Mr. Hatt, having removed his cows, paid the costs of the summons, which was withdrawn. A return was filled up showing the cows slaughtered by direction of the inspectors, under the authority of the orders of the Privy Council, between the 26th of August and the 23rd of September, 1865. It appeared that 10 of Mr. Dexter's cows were slaughtered, which he valued at £180, and 45 of Mr. Hatt's, valued at £810. APPENDIX. No. IV. gas. Seventy-two observations were made during the quarter, upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at Nos. 40, Parliament-street, 73, Bessborough-street, and 78, Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard required by the Act. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour the turmeric paper, except on April 3rd, 10th, 17th, and 24th, when the common gas of the London Company presented slight traces of ammonia.
