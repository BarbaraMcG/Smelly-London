Mrs. Bishop, Municipal Midwife, continued to serve at the Battlers Green Emergency Maternity Home, Radlett, throughout the year 1943, and Mrs. Bronnick. served at this Home until 4th December, 1943. 11 SECTION A. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. 1. Births. The number of live births during the year 1943 shows an increase over the previous year. There were 1,236 live births compared with 1,205 in 1942. There were 36 still births,—the figure for the previous year being twenty-nine. 2. Deaths. (a) General. Three hundred and sixteen deaths were registered in Barking and the number in the year 1942 was 263—of these deaths eight were of non-residents compared with seven in the year 1942 and Barking residents who died elsewhere numbered 325 (310 in 1942). Taking into account residents who died elsewhere and excluding the deaths of visitors we get a net figure of:— Males. 359 Females. 274 Total. 633 12 The principal causes of deaths are shown in the following tables, supplied by the Registrar General.

Forty-six children under the age of one year died during the period under review, there being 43 such deaths in the year 1942. A table showing the actual causes of death of these children under one year of age is set out hereunder:— 0-1 mth. 1-3 mths. 3-6 mths. 6-9 mths. 9-12 mths.

Two Barking women died owing to or in consequence of pregnancy or childbirth during 1943. This is the same figure as for 1942. 3. Social Conditions. (a) General. It is not practicable to write in detail as to the social conditions in Barking without using statistics which we are precluded from using by reason of the fact they might be of help to the enemy, but generally I can say that the social conditions remain as heretofore, that your social services have been widely used by the people of Barking and that the standard of health remains high. Infant mortality for 1943 was 37.2, and for the last five years shows an average of 35.7. (b) Scales of Assessment. During 1943 an arrangement was made with the Hertfordshire County Council for the payment to them of a flat rate for each case confined in that County under the official scheme for the evacuation of expectant mothers in the last month of pregnancy, assessment and collection of fees from the patient being dealt with by you under your own scales of charges. In December, 1943, following negotiations with the Hospital Saving Association and the Hospital Saturday Fund, arrangements were made for the acceptance of vouchers from those Associations in respect of maternity cases in full settlement of your charges. 15 (c) Unemployment. I have sought the help of the local branch of the Ministry of Labour and National Service who advise me that during the year 1943 unemployment in this area has been the lowest on record in both the men and women's sections. The demand for labour has considerably exceeded the supply, consequently large numbers of workmen have been brought into this district. That there has been unemployment is largely due to the fact that there must in every community, be some persons who because of physical disability or other reasons, are not able to work at all, or only able to work in specially selected appointments, and then perhaps only for short periods at intervals. With special reference to female labour the year 1943 has produced in large numbers, a class of labour not previously used to any extent; namely, part time employment of women. Reports received from the Employers show that women engaged on part time work have, on the whole, been very satisfactory and the demand is on the increase. The development of day nursery facilities to look after the children during the time the mothers are at work, has been of great benefit. (d) Travelling Facilities. The afternoon of September 24th was clear and sunny, not too hot and not too cold—a beautiful day even more wondrous than summer for those who could stand the little tinge of chill creeping into the autumn atmosphere. It was a day to rejoice. 16 Fate sent me down the steps of the District Railway at Westminster and kept me in the sewer that runs on four wheels all the way to Barking. By the time I got to Barking I was tired, sweaty, had a terrible headache, felt sick, and although it was now about six o'clock and the time had come to think seriously of some food before an evening of Committee work, the very idea of food was nauseating. I do admit I am not a good traveller, but what happens to me is a measure of the harm which must be done to everybody, even those who are not conscious of it. Of this trouble I have written repeatedly before the war and I write once again in the hope that the task of putting right this glaring nuisance shall be regarded as one of the first things demanding postwar attention. (e) Population. The population of Barking is a secret number which may not be published because it might help the enemy to assess movements of the population, but the number is known confidentially by Councillors individually. It is a matter of considerable interest in planning post-war re-development that we should have in mind the factors which are likely to vary the population of Barking. It is wise to know that on the front of everybody's rent book there is a number which represents the permitted number of people for that house without it being deemed to be overcrowded. In assessing this number we have regard to all the rooms in the house which are over fifty square feet, \ 17 notwithstanding they may be kitchens if normally used as a living room. At the time these assessments were made it was recognised that the method of assessment was bad and that the Committee thought it was too high, and indeed represented a degree of overcrowding, but it was felt, I believe wisely, that the whole idea, which was novel, was a very good one and that the method of assessment could be varied in the light of experience with substantial lessening of the permitted number for houses. It must be recognised that in the future these necessary and desirable variations will become operative, that the present unsatisfactory method of assessing the permitted number will be altered and that generally there will be a less population per house. It may not be practicable to leave out altogether the living rooms because otherwise people could claim that this room was a kitchen, this room was a dining room, this room was a sewing room, and so forth, with the result that relatively large houses could be deemed to be overcrowded with only a small number of people in them. On the other hand, there should be in every house one reasonably large bedroom near the bathroom and with a fireplace, and notwithstanding its size should only be assessed for one person, so that for coughs and colds and influenzal chills it will be possible by arrangement of sleeping accommodation to make provision for the isolation of such a case. This object could also be achieved by discounting the first 60 sq. feet of floor area. c 19 SECTION B. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. I. General Health Services. (a) Ambulance Facilities. The extent of the use of the normal Ambulance Service during the year 1943, is shown by the 4,273 patients conveyed by ambulance, and reciprocal arrangements with other Authorities are still in operation. Our experience in the war years has taught us that an ambulance service must be, and in fact in Barking is, an integral part of your health service. During the first week of the War the peace-time ambulance service was taken over and operated by Civil Defence personnel under my direction, and has so remained. Barking Corporation was the first local authority to operate in this way. The fact that there has not been one serious complaint about the service given is a sufficient commentary upon the manner in which the personnel has discharged this important duty. With the transfer of the peace-time ambulance service, unified control of all forms of ambulance work—accidents, hospital removals, infectious patients and Civil Defence—was achieved. 20 During the present year a further stage in ambulance provision was completed by the introduction of the " no-charge " scheme as and from April ist. In the Government White Paper on a National Health Service the reference to ambulances appears to be incidental, describing such services as " usual ancillary hospital services." The White Paper, however, does postulate that in future ambulance provision will be a health function. With this view I am in full accord. It is obvious that such service is more akin to the work of the Medical Officer of Health than that of a transport superintendent or other administrative officer. With a change in hospital service envisaged in the White Paper changes in the ambulance service must arise, but notwithstanding any alteration in the distribution of the vehicles I still feel that any ambulance service should remain under the control of the Medical Officer of Health. (b) Hospital Facilities. The Barking Hospital, the Corporation's infectious disease hospital pre-war, continued to be administered by the Corporation for the Ministry of Health as an emergency hospital under the Emergency Medical Services Scheme. By arrangement cases under your Maternity and Child Welfare and School Medical Service Schemes are admitted as well as those for which the Ministry of Health are responsible. As in previous years financial assistance has been afforded voluntary hospitals catering for residents in the borough. 21 (c) Clinics and Treatment Centres. Your Clinics and Out-Patient Departments are always in great demand and the attendances in the year we are now dealing with totalled 126,500. This compares with 118,000 in the year 1942 and 90,000 in 1939. Public appreciation of these Examination and Treatment Centres is of the highest, caused largely, I think, by the comprehensive nature of your Schemes ; and the standard of achievement in their application. An additional Infant Welfare Clinic was established at the Upney First Aid Post premises in July, 1943, two sessions now being held there weekly. Since April, 1943, an evening Clinic has been held weekly at the Upney Maternity Hospital to cater for the ante-natal supervision of war workers. (d) Foot Clinic. This work has again increased and we have been fortunate (particularly in war-time) in obtaining additional qualified staff for this important Health Service. Statistics are given hereunder which shows how the activities of the Clinic have progressed. Year 1941 Year 1942 Year 1943 Trcatment Sessions 535 903 1346 New Patients 627 964 1,269 Treatments given 3,358 5,475 8,568 During the year 1943, the individual patients totalled 1895, and it is a matter of special comment 22 that 255 treatments by Infra-red Ray were given to 44 patients. Your arrangements for evening sessions continue. (e) Skin Clinics. The appointment of Dr. Arthur Burrows, of the London Hospital, as your Specialist Consultant in Skin Diseases, has added greatly to the efficiency of your Health- Services. Dr. Burrows attends weekly at the Barking Hospital Clinic (first session on the 16th February, 1943), treatments being undertaken at two other sessions. Statistics in relation to the year ended 31st December, 1943, are as follows :— Consultations Treatments Sessions 38 79 Attendances:— Children under 5 years 163 255 Children 5-15 years 185 549 Ante Natal & Post Natal Cases 57 132 Other categories (including Public Adult Scheme) 100 149 Dr. Burrows advises me that the Clinic is very well attended, that many good results have been obtained, but that the treatment facilities would be greatly improved by the local provision of an X-ray therapy plant, although this apparatus could not be obtained at present. 23 (f) Scabies. During the year under review the provision of baths and out-patient treatment has continued. The number of new cases has decreased when compared with the year 1942, and the following is a statement of cases reported and treated during 1943 :— New Cases Recurring Cases Total Total number of patients 735 109 844 Adults Children 194 541 8 101 202 642 Referred from :— Clinics 591 92 683 Other Soutces 146 15 161 Number of cases cleansed :— Adults 175 7 182 Children 463 97 560 Of the remaining 102 who were not cleansed at the Barking Hospital, 166 were treated at the clinics, and 36 were otherwise dealt with. In addition on request 66 contacts (45 adults, 21 children) were given baths at the Barking Hospital. (g) General District Nursing. Skilled nursing in the Home is available for all residents, it being undertaken by the Plaistow Maternity Hospital and District Nurses Home and the East Barking District Nursing Association. The number of visits during the year ended 31st December, 1943, was 18,838; and additional staff have been appointed to better provide for this work. The Council render generous financial assistance to the organisations mentioned. 24 (h) Post-War Re-development. The Post-War Re-development Committee have considered various schemes for housing and medical services after the war and have drawn up programmes, in order of priority, for the first, second and third years. Early in 1943, it had been agreed in principle that a main health centre should be established at the Barking Hospital with four subsidiary centres in different parts of the town, and this scheme, together with housing schemes and the extension of maternity hospital accommodation, was included in the programme for the first year. (2) MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. (a) Ante-Natal and Post-Natal Supervision. Although in 1943 many expectant mothers evacuated, the number of attendances of ante-natal cases at your clinics amounted to 11,955, an increase of over 1,700 on the figure for the previous year. The number of post-natal attendances (85 5) showed an increase of over 150 and gynaecological attendances (1,242) an increase of nearly 500 over the previous year. It is gratifying to note that the Upney Post-Natal Clinic, with its special facilities, continued to be used by a very large majority of the patients requiring examination as post-natal or gynaecological cases, although, as in previous years, facilities were available at all the Clinics for such patients to be seen. 25 (b) Midwifery. (i) Supervision.—There were fourteen midwives practising in the Borough at the end of the year, eight of whom were employed at the Upney Maternity Pavilion. During the year 1943, midwives sought medical assistance in 157 cases; 36 of these were on behalf of babies. (ii) Midwives Act, 1936.—469 mothers were delivered in Barking under your district midwifery scheme during the year 1943. In addition 27 mothers were delivered by doctors with district midwives in attendance. (iii) Analgesia in Domiciliary Midwifery.-—Of the 6 domiciliary midwives practising in Barking at the end of the year, 3 were qualified to administer gas and air analgesia ; in addition 2 midwives who practised in Barking during 1943 but left before the end of the year were so qualified. In all, analgesia was administered in 54 domiciliary confinement cases. (c) Upney Maternity Pavilion {and Marking Emergency Hospital). At the Upney Maternity Pavilion during 1943, 508 patients were confined, 62 patients were admitted for ante-natal treatment, 7 for post-natal treatment (including 2 post-miscarriage cases) and there were 10 miscarriages, 1 abortion and x hydatidifrom mole. 4 unaccompanied babies were also admitted. d 26 At the Barking Emergency Hospital 271 expectant mothers spent a total of 1,955 bed days. In addition, the Barking Hospital has been used in other ways ; there were 133 gynaecological, 3 miscarriage, 7 postmiscarriage, 5 abortion, 2 post-hydatidiform mole and 33 post-confinement cases, a total of 183 who spent 2,332 bed days. 21 babies were admitted with their mothers, included in the post-confinement cases figure, and there were 5 unaccompanied babies, giving a total of 27 babies who spent 404 bed days in hospital. (d) Evacuation. Evacuation of expectant mothers in the last month of pregnancy proceeded in 1943 as in 1942. 172 were sent to Radlett, and, owing to the limited accommodation there, 5 were sent to other places in Hertfordshire and 16 to other reception areas in England. (e) Home Helps. 1943 saw the inception of a service for the provision of home helps employed by the Council as casual workers. In the first place these home helps were made available only to women who were unable to make satisfactory arrangements of their own at the time of their confinement, but towards the end of the year the scheme was extended to cover households where such help was required owing to the illness of an expectant mother, a nursing mother or a child under the age of five years. At the end of the year there were three home helps on the Council's panel and a home help had been provided in 8 confinement cases. 27 (f) Infant Welfare Centres. The total number of attendances at the Infant Welfare centres during 1943 was 33,085, compared with 31,179 in 1942. (g) Home Visiting. The total number of visits paid during 1943 was 17,308, a decrease when compared with the figure of 17,950 for the year 1942. Home visiting is the basis of a maternity and child welfare scheme and I am sorry that there was a decrease in the number of such home visits. The circumstances are first that health visitors were used in our drive for diphtheria immunisation, and second that for a part of the year we were without our full complement of health visitors. (h) Circumcision Clinic. This clinic was carried on regularly during the year 1943, and 134 cases received treatment. (i) Supplementary Clothing Coupons for Expectant Mothers. From the 1st January to the 24th July, 1943, clothing coupons were issued by your officers to 773 patients, 5 of which were in respect of twin pregnancies. From the 25th July, 1943, onwards the Food Executive Officer became responsible for these issues. (j) Issue of Vitamins to Expectant Mothers and Children. The Government Scheme for the issue of cod liver oil and fruit juices to expectant mothers and to children under five years of age continued throughout 28 the year. In April, 1943, Vitamin A and D tablets were made available to expectant mothers, in the place of cod liver oil, where preferred. An increase was noted in the numbers taking advantage of the supplies of fruit juices but the numbers of both expectant mothers and children availing themselves of the facilities for obtaining cod liver oil or Vitamin A and D tablets continued to be comparatively low, i.e. about 30% of the number eligible—in spite of the efforts of your officers to increase the take-up of those products. (k) Adoption of Children. On the 1st June, 1943, the Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act, 1939, came into operation. Section 7 of this Act imposes the duty upon any person, other than the parent or guardian of a child or the person with whom a child has been placed, who participates in the arrangements for the placing of the child to notify in writing the Welfare Authority of the area in which the child is to be placed. No such notification was received during 1943, although according to information received by your officers in two cases a private individual was concerned in the arrangements. (1) Infestation by Head Lice. In July Circular 2831 was received from the Ministry dealing with the promotion of cleanliness and elimination of verminous conditions amongst mothers and children under the age of five years. In order to relieve the Health Visitors of some of their Clinic duties and to give them more time to concentrate on this work, it was decided to appoint 29 two additional part-time clinic nurses. One of these part time nurses started duty on 16th October, 1943, but we were unable to get another nurse until 10th January, 1944. Unfortunately owing to the resignation of two health visitors the staff was depleted for the remainder of the year. At this time, too, the immunisation campaign for children under five years was in full swing together with the winding up of the campaign for the school children. It is not possible, therefore, to show any concrete work done in regard to the cleanliness of children under five years of age but, I am satisfied that constant work is being done towards our final goal. (k) War-time Day Nurseries. During the year the two Nurseries at Eastbury House and Lodge Farm continued to function and a third Nursery, to be known as Castle Green Nursery, accommodating 50 children, was erected on a site at the junction of Goresbrook Road and Gale Street. This was completed and equipped and arrangements were made for it to be opened early in the New Year of 1944. The average daily attendances, excluding Saturdays, were 69 for Eastbury and 32 for Lodge Farm. (3) ORTHOPAEDIC SERVICES. Your Specialist Consultant, Mr. A. M. A. Moore, held twelve Consultation sessions during 1943, and an additional masseuse was engaged in the latter part of the year, because of the increase in the number of patients to be dealt with under your various treatment schemes. 30 PARTICULARS OF THE WORK DONE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORTHOPAEDIC CLINIC DURING 1943.

Our scheme for the operative treatment of ear, nose and throat defects at the Barking Hospital is, of course, still in abeyance and our arrangements with the Queen Mary's, King George and St. Mary's Hospitals continue. There have been additional consultations and treatments at your Specialist Consultant Clinic with a consequent increase in the number of sessions, the total number of such sessions being 44 compared with 28 in the previous year. Statistics in relation to the cases treated in the years 1942 and 1943 are as follows :— Mothers & Toddlers Adults—Public Scheme School Children Total 1942 1943 1942 1943 1942 1943 1942 1943 Number of attendances at the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic 241 274 10 26 497 838 748 1,138 Number of cases which received operative treatment 77 97 - - 171 353 248 450 Number of cases which received other forms of treatment 42 51 5 11 198 561 245 623 (5) OPHTHALMIC SERVICES. There has been further development in your ophthalmic services, the numbers requiring examination and treatment under all your ophthalmic schemes 32 having increased and to cater therefor, additional sessions have been held by your Specialist Consultant. A statistical statement showing the cases dealt with in the years 1942 and 1943 is given below. Another important development is the Council's recent decision to appoint an Ophthalmic Nurse. Unfortunately owing to the general scarcity of trained nursing staff we have not as yet been successful in finding a suitable candidate. The Appointments Branch of the Ministry of Labour is the controlling body for the nomination and placing of candidates. Excellent co-operation exists between the officers of the Appointments Branch and the staff of my. Department and efforts to obtain suitable nominations are constantly being made through the recognised channels. (a) Treatment of Defective Vision and Squint— Table of Statistics.

The number of attendances under your public adult dental scheme was 8,019, compared with 3,730 in the year 1942 and your evening sessions provide in major degree for patients coming under this scheme. The question of man-power as it effects your dental service is a matter for concern but here again we are doing our utmost to obtain qualified dental surgeons to maintain your existing staff complement, although at the time of writing the post of fourth dental surgeon is still vacant. Information as to the cases dealt with in the year ended 31st December, 1943, and 1942 under your Public Adult and Maternity and Child Welfare Dental Schemes, are given below :— Scheme Year ended 31st Dec., 1942 Year ended 31st Dec., 1943 (a) Number of Visits of Patients to Clinics 6,039 10,266 (h) Number of Dentures Supplied 597 1,670 35 SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. (1) RAINFALL. The rainfall for the year ended 31st December, 1943, was 19.50 inches, as compared with 21.64 f°r the previous year. Rain fell on 140 days in the year 1943. (2) WATER SUPPLY. There was no extension of mains during the year 1943. Samples are drawn from the domestic supplies and submitted every quarter for chemical examination, and monthly for bacteriological examination. All samples were reported pure and wholesome and suitable for drinking and domestic purposes. (3) DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. Drainage arrangements continue as heretofore. 36 (4) RIVERS AND STREAMS. Owing to the continuation of the war, the area of drainage under the control of the Essex Rivers Catchment Board does not appear to have received the same attention as before, with the resulting deterioration in the condition of the main sewers and watercourses. From time to time attention has been directed to the potential mosquito menace in this part of the district, which will be increased by the return of 'discharged soldiers who may, in their service abroad, have contracted malaria. With this problem in mind, I regard as a matter of urgency the introduction of a scheme of improved drainage so soon as possible after peace is declared. (5) CLOSET ACCOMMODATION. At the end of the year there remained a total of 15 premises unconnected with the sewer, 10 of which were factory premises. (6) PUBLIC CLEANSING. During the year 3,477 loads of refuse were collected with an average weight of 2.82 tons per load. 37 The practice of a daily collection of waste food and a fortnightly collection of other domestic refuse continued. (7) REFUSE DISPOSAL. The refuse of the Borough, by arrangement with the County Borough of East Ham, was taken to the destructor works of that Authority. (8) SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. War conditions have limited housing repair work to the minimum, but there has been a steady improvement in conditions in general, associated with a serious effort to prevent any deterioration of the building structure. Notwithstanding this, however, it is obvious that a large amount of repair will be necessary in the immediate postwar years to obtain the high standard which existed before the war. Arising out of the many inspections made for the above purpose, it has been possible to build up a picture of the housing need in terms of dwellings which will be required. 38 (a) Work of Sanitary Inspectors.

(6) Piggeries. (7) Stables. 41 (d) Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919. The year under review saw an increase in activities under this Act with the issue of the Infestation Order, 1943. As a result of a direction from the Ministry of Food Director of Infestation Control, particulars were supplied of 23 sites of major infestation, 20 of which have now been cleared. Two of your officers attended a short course of instruction in a new technique which was subsequently employed with success. Special publicity through the national and local press, together with the issue of special posters in the district, produced, during the period covered by this propaganda, 132 complaints. The total number of complaints received during the year were 304. Many related to minor infestations and were dealt with by the issue of suitable raticides. In other cases appropriate action was taken by your officers, using new methods. (9) ERADICATION OF BED BUGS.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. (1) MILK SUPPLY. There are no cowkeepers in the district and we have only one dairy where milk is handled or treated. The remaining 48 premises on the register retail pre-packed supplies. In addition there are nine milk purveyors who occupy premises in other districts, but retail in Barking. The following table sets out the results of the bacteriological examination of various samples. Type of Sample Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Totals " Sterilised " Milk " Pasteurised " Milk 39 2 41 Raw Milk 10 19 29 " Homogenised " Milk 7 7 Tuberculin Tested Milk 18 3 21 Totals 74 24 98 In the table above it will be noted that 19 samples of raw milk were found to be unsatisfactory. This term " unsatisfactory," however, must be qualified. With the advent of the Milk Advisory officers employed by the Essex War Agricultural Committee and the use of the Reazurin Test, a change in the classification took place. The standard conditions in Barking had been set originally by use of the Methylene Blue Test of keeping quality and it was this test which 48 showed the 19 unsatisfactory results. The samples concerned were drawn from farm supplies at the place of delivery in Barking, where the milk was subsequently processed and treated by pasteurisation. Your officers have co-operated with the officers of the Essex War Agricultural Committee with a view to securing the best conditions at the farms of the producers. It was anticipated that with the introduction of the Milk Scheme the Milk Advisory officers would be sampling the raw milk brought into Barking every fourteen days, but from our enquiries it does not seem that it has been found possible to make such frequent sampling. I realise the importance of securing the delivery of as much milk as possible to the public for liquid consumption. At the same time I deplore the lowering of the standard of cleanliness which has resulted from the inclusion of producers whose milk normally would have gone for manufacturing purposes. The present price structure of the Ministry of Food control, which provides for the payment of an extra sum of money for the production of clean milk is, in my opinion, bad. The remedy should be the application of a penalty to any unsatisfactory producer. There were, during the year, 72 samples of milk submitted to biological examination for the presence of tubercle. In eight cases the guinea pig died prematurely. In no case was there a positive result. I am glad to record that, apart from the Tuberculin Tested Milk retailed under that designation, the whole 49 of the supplies in Barking have been treated satisfactorily either by Pasteurisation or Sterilisation. The following table shows the number of licences granted during the year for the sale of graded milks under the Milk (Special Designations) Orders, 1936 and 1938 :— Tuberculin Tested 7 Pasteurised 15 {2) MEAT AND OTHER FOODS. (a) Meat. Since the outbreak of war slaughtering in Barking has been discontinued. (b) Supervision of Food Preparing Premises. The number of premises in the district at the end of the year at which the following foods are prepared were :— Sausages 22 Potted Meat and Brawn 2 Roast and/or Boiled Ham 2 Pressed, Pickled, Cooked, etc., Beef and Tongue 36 Roast Pork — Bacon — Boiled Crabs and Lobsters 2 Pickled Fish 2 Pickled Onions, etc. 1 Smoked Fish 4 Bakehouses 10 50 (c) Unsound Food. The War-time control has resulted in an increase in the amount of food surrendered. The following list can be regarded as representing the whole of the food retailed in the district found unfit for consumption. Provisions 1,019 lbs. Sugar 46 lbs. Chocolate, Sweets, Cakes, etc. 21 lbs. Dried Fruit 30 lbs. Meat 4,332 lbs. Cereals 1,320 lbs. Fish 28 stone Rabbits 5 cases Various Fillings 5,290 tins, jars, etc. Eggs 222 (3) FOOD POISONING. There was one case of food poisoning notified during the year. (4) FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938, SAMPLING. During the year, your authorised officers have submitted a total of 201 samples, divided as follows :— Milk 29 Butter and Margarine 14 Others 158 201 The reports of the Borough Analysts, Dr. B. Dyer and Dr. J. H. Hamence, Great Tower Street, London, E.C., show that of this total, thirteen were found not genuine. 51 A prosecution was instituted in relation to the sale of Rum, in which the defence satisfied the Bench that the wrong person had been summoned. The point at issue was whether the sale was made by the Licensee or the employing Company. The Bench held that the employing Company was the offender. In the case of the sale of Lemon Squash which was deficient in the total of sugar to the extent of at least 17%, the Ministry of Food prosecuted and the defendant was fined £5 with £6 6s. od. costs. (5) CHEMICAL AND BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF FOOD. The bacteriological examination of all milk and water samples is carried out for this Authority by the Counties Public Health Laboratories, of Gidea Park College, Essex, whilst the examination of samples of milk for the presence of tubercle is carried out by Dr. A. L. Sheather, of Chorleywood, Herts. 53 SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. (1) NOTIFICATION. The following table shows the number of notifications of infectious diseases (other than tuberculosis) received during 1943 :— Disease Total Total Cases Removed to Hospital Deaths Sonne Dysentery 2 2 Paratyphoid 1 1 1 Food Poisoning 1 — — * Scarlet Fever 398 310 2 ‡Diphtheria 35 36 1 Puerperal Pyrexia 19 19 — †Pneumonia— Acute Influenzal 31 15 6 Acute Primary 75 26 5 Following Measles 7 3 — Erysipelas 41 17 1 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 9 9 — Measles 797 4 — Whooping Cough 277 14 2 § Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis 6 7 1 Others — 24 3 Totals 1,699 487 22 * 88 cases of Scarlet Fever were nursed at home. One death, cause believed to be Scarlet Fever, subsequently proved not to be the case. ‡ One case was admitted to hospital before a definite diagnosis was made. This proved to be Diphtheria, and the patient subsequently died. †8 eases of Pneumonia died at home. § In two cases notified as Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis, the original diagnosis was not confirmed by the Hospital. One of these cases died. One case was subsequently diagnosed as " Staphlococcal Meningitis." One case which was admitted to hospital before a definite diagnosis was made, subsequently proved to be Cetebro-Spinal Meningitis. 54 (2) HOSPITALISATION. During the year cases of Infectious Disease requiring admission were admitted to the Ilford Isolation Hospital, Plaistow Fever, Rush Green Isolation, Billericay, Grays, Waltham Cross, Dartford, and also Hospitals of the London County Council. The following table shows the cases dealt with at Hospitals :— In Hospital 31st Dec., 1942 Admitted during year Died Discharged In Hospital 31st Dec., 1943 Sonne Dysentery – 2 2 – Paratyphoid — 1 1 — — *Scarlet Fever 41 310 2 325 24 Diphtheria (including Membraneous Croup) 6 36 1 36 5 ‡Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis 1 7 1 5 2 Pneumonia 2 44 11‡ 41 2 Puerperal Pyrexia 2 19 – 20 1 Erysipelas 1 17 1 16 1 whooping Cough — 14 2 11 1 Measles — 4 — 4 — Ophthalmia Neonatorum — 9 — 8 1 Others 2 24 3 22 1 † Eight cases of Pneumonia died at home. * Eighty-eight cases of Scarlet Fever were nursed at home. One death, cause believed to be Scarlet Fever, subsequently proved not to be the case. $ In two cases notified as Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis, the original diagnosis was not confirmed by the Hospital. One of these died. One case was subsequently diagnosed as " Staphlococcal Meningitis." 55 (3) PARATYPHOID FEVER. Below I give a table showing the number of cases of Paratyphoid Fever which have occurred in Barking over a period of seven years. Year Number of Cases Notified Admitted to Hospital 1937 17 17 1938 8 8 1939 2 2 1940 22 22 1941 1 1 1942 1943 1 1 (4) ACUTE PRIMARY PNEUMONIA. There was some increase in the incidence of " Acute Primary Pneumonia," the number of notifications received being 75, whereas in the previous year there were 45. Of the 75 cases notified 32 occurred in children under the age of 15 years. There is no evidence to show that this increase was due to war-time conditions. (5) CEREBRO SPINAL MENINGITIS. Six notifications were received and in two cases the diagnosis was not confirmed. This shows a decrease when compared with 1942, the total number of cases notified being 18, ten of which were confirmed by the Hospital authorities. 56 (6) TUBERCULOSIS. Particulars of new cases of tuberculosis in the area during 1943 are given below :— New Cases Notified Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M. F. M. F. Under 1 year – – – – 1 to 5 years — — 1 1 5 to 15 years 4 1 1 6 15 to 25 years 14 18 1 5 25 to 35 years 16 10 1 1 35 to 45 years 11 10 3 1 45 to 55 years 10 2 — — 55 to 65 years 5 2 — – 65 years and upwards 1 2 — — 61 45 7 14 One hundred and twenty-seven notifications were received of all forms of tuberculosis—pulmonary 106 and non-pulmonary 21, and there were four deaths of un-notified cases, making a total of 131 new cases. Information has been received of the removal into the district of 19 tuberculous persons, included in the number of notifications received—two of these are old cases returned to Barking. This compares with 28 received during 1942, and 37 for 1941. 57 Statistics in relation to Tuberculosis for the years 1939 to 1943 are given below :— Year 1939 Year 1940 Year 1941 Year 1942 Year 1943 New Cases Notified— Pulmonary 76 117 113 107 106 Non-Pulmonary 18 15 28 30 21 Total of New Cases Notified 94 132 141 137 127 Deaths from Tuberculosis— Pulmonary 48 41 48 37 42 Non-Pulmonary 3 2 8 7 4 Total Deaths from Tuberculosis 51 43 56 44 46 The Tuberculosis Officer advises me that any increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in Barking during the year 1943 as compared with the preceding year does not appear to be significant. There was no increase in the availability of methods of diagnosis in the area but there appeared to be increased use by medical practitioners of the services available for diagnosis. (7) SCARLET FEVER. Three hundred and ninety-eight notifications of scarlet fever were received, the number for 1942 being 334. This shows a slight increase, but the type of infection was not severe. 58 Hospital accommodation for infectious diseases was not quite so difficult to obtain as in the previous year (1942), but at the beginning and towards the end of the year it became necessary to send patients so far distant as Grays, Billericay and Dartford. With the approval of the Minister of Health a temporary supply of medicine and medical assistance (including nursing) was available throughout the year for inhabitants of the district where hospitalisation could not be arranged. (8) WHOOPING COUGH. Notifications of this disease show a slight decrease, the total number being 277, whereas in the previous year 290 cases were notified. Previously I have spoken of the difficulty in Diagnosing Whooping Cough, which, of course, is much greater in the course of general practice than it is in the course of hospital practice, and of the consequential difficulty in interpreting statistics. Elsewhere I have pointed out that mothers, perhaps quite naturally, refuse to send their children to school when whooping cough is known to be about, 59 and because in these days they have to find some excuse for not sending their children to school, seize upon the convenient fiction that their own children are suffering from whooping cough, which, of course, still further makes statistics difficult to interpret. Beyond this I find that during the year 1943, 30 per cent., of all our notifications of whooping cough came from one general medical practitioner, and that 56 per cent. came from four medical practitioners. My deduction from this is that there is even amongst medical men a wide variation in the clinical evidence on which they are prepared to make a diagnosis of whooping cough. It would appear, therefore, that the time has come when notification of whooping cough should be made much more standard than it is today. (9) MEASLES. The incidence of this disease showed some decrease—797 notifications were received, whereas in 1942 there were 1,260. 6o (10) DIPHTHERIA. Compared with 1942 there is a decrease in the number of cases notified—3 5 notifications were received during the year under review, and 57 during 1942. (11) ARTIFICIAL IMMUNISATION. The total number of children inoculated against diphtheria was 7,089 as compared with 1,662 in 1942. In November, 1942, a Diphtheria Immunisation Campaign was commenced, and during 1943 children were inoculated by your medical officers both at the schools and at the clinics. At 31st December, 1943, a total of 13,630 children under 15 years of age had been immunised against Diphtheria, that is, 80 per cent. of the child population in Barking. This includes over 3,000 children of 5 years of age and under, and represents the huge majority of those whose parents had consented to such treatment. Immunisation against whooping cough and scarlet fever was carried out simultaneously, the total number of children inoculated against these two complaints being respectively 136 and 49. 61 Table of Statistics—Year 1943.

(12) VENEREAL DISEASE. Treatment of Venereal Disease in this area is, of course, a matter for the County Council, and the arrangements continue with General Hospitals including the County Hospital at Oldchurch and the Turner Street Clinic (London Hospital).
