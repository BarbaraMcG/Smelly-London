Printed in accordance with Section 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, (18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120,) and ordered to be circulated among the Inhabitants of the District. By the South Eastern Railway (New Lines and Widenings) Act, 1882, the South Eastern Railway Company were, amongst other things, authorised to make and maintain a line of Railway, commencing by a junction with the Charing Cross line, in the •neighbourhood of Ewer Street, thence proceeding in a southeasterly direction, and, after crossing Union Street, Little (now Great) Guildford Street, and Southwark Bridge Road, passing out of the district near the Parish boundary, and terminating at the Bricklayers' Arms Station, Old Kent Road; a second, or branch line, commencing by a junction with the above in Red Cross Street, passing in a northerly direction, and, after crossing Union Street, terminating by another junction with the Charing Cross line at Worcester Street; to widen the City Terminus Railway Bridge crossing the River Thames, and several of their existing b2 South Eastern Railway (Additional Powers) Bill, 1886. 6 lines in St. Saviour's, and to enter on, take, and use such lands within the limits of deviation shown upon the deposited plans as might be required for tho purposes of their soveral undertakings. The Act, which received the Royal Assent on the 15th August, 1882, provides (inter alia) that the powers of the Company for the compulsory purchase of lands shall not be exercised after the expiration of three years, and that if the Railways thereby authorised are not completed within five years from the passing thereof, the powers granted to tho Company for making and completing them shall cease, except as to so much thereof as shall then be completed. By the South Eastern Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1885, the time limited by the first-named Act for the compulsory purchase of lands was extended until the expiration of one year from the 18th August, 1885, but no steps were taken by the Company to carry out tho works. In December, 1885, notice was received from the Company of their intention to apply to Parliament in the ensuing session for a further extension of time, viz., for a period of two years from the 18th August, 1880, for the compulsory purchase of lands, and for a period of three years from the 18th August, 1887, for the completion of the Railways and Widenings; and a Bill was shortly afterwards deposited in the Private Bill Office of the House of Commons for giving effect thereto, the 18th Section being as follows:—“ The time limited by the South Eastern Railway (New Lines and Widenings) Act, 1882, as extended by the South Eastern Railway (Various Powers) Act, 1885, for the compulsory purchase of lands required for and the t ime limited by the said first mentioned Act for the completion of the following Railways and Railway Widenings, authorised by the first mentioned Act, viz.: — (1) The Railways No. 1 and No. 2 in the County of Surrey, and the Railway No. 4 in the County of Kent; (2) The several Widenings of the Charing Cross Railway, and of the Charing Cross (City Terminus) Railway, are hereby respectively extended as regards the compulsory purchase of lands for a period of two years from the 18th day of August, 1886, and as regards the completion of the Railways and Railway Widenings for a period of three years from the 18th day of August, 1887." 7 The attention of the Board having been directed to the serious loss and injury sustained by owners and occupiers of property in the district, the letting and rateable value of which had been greatly diminished owing to the procrastination of the Company and the uncertainty felt as to whether they intended to proceed with the works, the Board, in January last, on receipt of a memorial from a public meeting of inhabitants and ratepayers held at the Bricklayers' Institute, Southwark Bridge Road, complaining of the delay, resolved to oppose the Bill for a further extention of time, and instructed Mr. J. H. Burnet, of No. 27, Borough High Street, Solicitor, to prepare and lodge a Petition to the House of Commons against it. This was done, the Metropolitan Board of Works and several of the local Vestries adopting a similar course. In February, however, Mr. Burnet received an intimation from the solicitor of the Company to the effect that they had determined to abandon the 18th Section above referred to, and the withdrawal was shortly afterwards effected accordingly. Thus the matter stands, the powers of the Company, under the original Act, as amended by the Various Powers Act, 1885, for the compulsory purchase of lands, being still operative and unchanged, but if not exercised by the 18th August next they will have lapsed. Those for the carrying out of the works will not expire until the 18th August, 1887. The Company are proceeding with the widening of the City Terminus Bridge, and works in connection therewith as authorized by their several Acts, but it is understood to be their intention to abandon the rest of the scheme. In July, 1885, the Board presented a Petition to the House of Lords in favour of the Corporation of London (Tower Bridge) Bill, the object of which is the construction of a low-level Bridge across the Thames, from Irongate Stairs on the north side to Hartley's Wharf on the south, with suitable approaches thereto, such Bridge to have a moveable central opening to admit of the passage at all times of the tide, when required, of vessels navigating the river. The principal grounds alleged by the Board in justification of their support were as follows, viz; (a) That a Bridge constructed at a low level and in the manner proposed in the Bill would, in the opinion of the Board, Tower Bridge 8 be the lest adapted to meet the necessities of the case, affording as it would a passage-way for shipping, and being free from the steep gradients which in the case of a high-level bridge or a subway are so objectionable; (b) That the scheme, if carried out, would greatly relieve the traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, of London Bridge and its approaches, particularly that portion of the Borough High Street within the St. Saviour's District, which, owing to the number of vehicles and foot passengers passing to and from London Bridge, the Railway Stations, and the Borough Market, is at times so greatly congested; (c) That London Bridge is wholly inadequate for the accommodation of the enormous traffic, and the vast and rapidly increasing population on either shore of the River Thames to the east of that bridge; and (d) That the projected Bridge is calculated to afford the desired relief. The Bill was supported by all the Local Vestries and District Boards with the exception of St. Olave's, and, subject to alterations affecting chiefly the Corporation and the Wharfingers who opposed it, was approved by the Select Committee of the House of Lords and read a third time on the 31st July, 1885. The works, which are to be carried out at the expense of the City Corporation out of the funds of the Bridge House Estates, have lately been commenced and are to be completed within five years. The Corporation are likewise to bear the expense of maintaining, lighting, and repairing the Bridge, but the approaches, when completed, are to be made over to the local authorities in whose districts they are situate. Southwark and Deptford Tramways. In November, Parliamentary Plans, Book of Reference, &c. were deposited of certain proposed extensions of the Southwark and Deptford Tramways, and of lands, houses, and buildings in the neighbourhood of Denman Street and Tooley Street, which the Company sought to acquire, for the purposes of stable accommodation, &c. in connection therewith. When, however, the matter came before the Metropolitan Board of Works they refused to give their consent to the scheme, and it had to be abandoned. Eailway Bridges. In consequence of the nuisance occasioned by the percolation of water through the bridges of the South Eastern Eailway Company crossing the Borough High Street and Southwark Street, and the inattention of the Company to repeated applications made 9 to them for repair of same, the Board, in June, 1885, instructed Mr. Chas. Greenwood to take legal proceedings to compel the execution of the necessary repairs. An action has been commenced accordingly, but it is not expected to be tried until after the long vacation. In September last, this Board, at the suggestion of the Yestry of St. Pancras, caused a Petition to be presented to the House of Commons regarding the management of the Eastern (Homerton) Hospital, which is under the control of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, expressing an opinion that the evidence taken by the Local Government Board Inspectors with reference to the expenditure, &c. disclosed a lack of efficient control over the affairs of the Hospital, a loose and careless mode of conducting the business of the establishment, and an extravagant outlay of public moneys, and praying for a searching enquiry by a Parliamentary Committee or a lloyal Commission, not only into the management and expenditure of the Hospital, but also into that of the other establishments of the Asylums Board and into the affairs of that Board generally. Metropolitan Asylums Board. In accordance with a suggestion made by the Westminster Board of Works, and in view of the impending Sixth Triennial Election of the School Board for London, this Board, in October last, caused to be prepared, printed, and distributed amongst the ratepayers a statistical statement showing the amount of accommodation provided in the Schools of the School Board and in the Yoluntary Schools in the St. Saviour's District, the cost thereof, and other particulars; likewise calling the attention of the ratepayers to the vast and constantly increasing expenditure of the School Board, and urging upon them the importance of securing the election of candidates of administrative ability who should be pledged to carry out the provisions of the Elementary Education Act with a due regard to economy. This Board also, at the suggestion of the Westminster Board of Works, addressed a communication to the Yice-President of the Council for Education, urging the abolition or material modification of the cumulative system of voting at School Board Elections. School Board Expenditure. In January last, a Precept was received from Sir Thomas Chambers, Knt., Q.C., the Returning Officer of the School Board for School Board Election Expenses. 10 London, requiring payment of the sum of £110 19s. 1d., being the apportioned amount charged by him upon this district for defraying the expenses of the Triennial Election in November, 1885. The amount appearing to the Board to be excessive, they resolved to defer for awhile the payment, and applied to Sir Thomas Chambers for a detailed statement of the expenditure incurred, who, however, did not reply to the communication addressed to him, and, having no alternative, the Board, in the latter part of February, paid the amount under protest. They also, in common with several other District Boards and Vestries, caused a representation of the facts of the case to be made to the Lords of the Education Department of the Privy Council, in the hope that they might be induced to intervene, but were informed that their Lordships had no power to compel the Returning Officer to supply the desired information. The matter was thereupon referred to the General Purposes Committee of this Board for investigation, together with a letter from the Wandsworth Board of Works, containing a series of resolutions passed by them on the subject, and, on the recommendation of such Committee, the Board expressed its concurrence with the following, viz.:—(a) “ That the placing of such unlimited and extraordinary powers in the hands of the Returning Officer is wrong in principle, and calculated to spread increased dissatisfaction amongst the ratepayers.“ (b) ” That the Education Department be requested to maize such provision as will render it necessary for the Returning Officer for the Metropolis, when issuing his Precepts to the Rating Authorities for their contributions towards the cost of any future School Board Election, to accompany such Precepts with a detailed account of the total expenditure, and also a statement showing the amount asked for from each Rating Authority." (c) " That the fees paid to the Returning Officer, the Deputy Returning Officers, Presiding Officers, Clerks, &c., together with all the other items of necessary expenditure, should be limited by statute, and that all such expenditure should be properly vouched and subject to taxation A further communication was accordingly addressed to the Education Department, transmitting a copy of the above resolutions, and expressing an opinion that the law should be amended and an A.ct similar in its provisions to the Parliamentary Elections (Returning 11 Officers) Act, 1875, passed for the purposes of regulating and controlling the charges of Returning Officers and their subordinates at School Board Elections. In November last, a circular-letter was received from the Vestry of Chelsea urging that in view of a probable increase in the contribution to the Metropolitan Board of Works on account of Fire Brigade Expenses, that Board should be requested to include in any Bill to be promoted by them in Parliament a clause empowering them to levy a larger rate on the Eire Insurance Offices to meet such increase, having regard to the fact that the Metropolitan Board report year by year a large and increasing deficit upon the Fire Brigade Working Account, and that the contribution paid by the Fire Insurance Companies towards the expenses of the Fire Brigade is very low in amount, being only £35 in the £1,000,000 on the gross amount insured. This Board approved the suggestion, and caused a letter to be addressed to the Metropolitan Board expressive of its concurrence, and requesting that the necessary steps might be taken to give effect thereto. The Metropolitan Board have since introduced a Bill to enable them to raise for the working expenses of the Fire Brigade a sum equal to what would be produced by a penny in the pound on the rateable value of property in the Metropolis, and providing that the Fire Insurance Companies' contribution shall be raised from £35 to £40 in the £1,000,000. The proposal, however, is strongly opposed by the Companies, and the Metropolitan Board have lately reported, that owing to the manner in which the Bill, ever since its introduction, has been persistently blocked by Members of the House of Commons, who object to the contributions of the Companies being increased, there has been no opportunity of obtaining from it an expression of opinion whether the Bill is one that should be read a second time, and the Dissolution has entirely closed the prospects of the Bill for the present. Fire Brigade Expenses. In December last, a letter was received from the Town Clerk of the City of London forwarding copy of a Report by a Special Committee of the Court of Common Council on a scheme prepared by them for the Municipal Government of the Metropolis, and requesting to be furnished with an expression of opinion on the C Government of the Metropolis 12 part of this Board. By the scheme in question it was proposed to divide the area of the Metropolis, as defined by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, into nine separate Municipalities, which, with the City of London, would then form ten for the whole of the Metropolitan district, each of such Municipalities to be a body corporate, consisting of a Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens, and with a central Representative Council to be composed of members from each of the local Municipalities, and meeting at the Guildhall for common purposes. The Board carefully considered the matter, but were of opinion that the creation of ton Municipalities, as proposed, would entail a largo addition to the expense of administration, prove unsatisfactory in working, and be prejudicial to the interests of the ratepayers; and the Town Clerk was so informed in reply to his letter. Collingwood Street. 1 Having regard to the irregularity of the numbering of the houses in Collingwood Street, Blackfriars Road, this Board, in March, 1885, applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works for an order for the renumbering of the same, and on the 29th January, 1886, an order was issued for so doing. Notices were accordingly served by this Board in March last on the occupiers of the houses for the renumbering, which has been carried out, and a schedule of their names has been forwarded to the Metropolitan Board, in order that a register thereof may be kept for the future identification of property. Stacking of Firewood. The Metropolitan Board of Works having introduced into Parliament a Bill for the purpose of enabling them to regulate the Stacking of Firewood in the Metropolis, the subject was considered by this Board at an early period of the Session. Communications were received from the Vestry of Rotherhithe and other Parishes in which the trade is largely carried on; likewise from an Association formed for the protection of the interests of the trade, urging that the enforcement of regulations of the kind contemplated by the Bill would have the effect of closing many of the store-yards in the Metropolis, thereby curtailing the business of firewood merchants, and be attended with great hardships to an exceedingly numerous and poor but deserving class of people, by depriving them of their only means of 13 livelihood. It was shown also that but a very small proportion of the fires in the Metropolis were occasioned by the stacking of firewood. The Board therefore were of opinion that the Bill was unnecessary for the protection of the public, and that in the interests of the trade and of the workpeople employed it should not be proceeded with. A resolution to this effect was passed and forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works, who shortly afterwards, yielding to the strong opposition it encountered, withdrew the Bill. By this Bill, as amended by a Select Committee of the House of Commons, it was provided that the cost of maintaining the New Streets at Hyde Park Corner should be defrayed in equal moieties by the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square. Deeming this arrangement to be unjust towards the poorer parishes, and otherwise objectionable as being a departure from the recognised principle that the cost of the maintenance of streets should be borne by the districts in which they are respectively situate, this Board resolved to cooperate with the Wandsworth Board of Works in opposing the same, and in May last presented a Petition to the House of Lords against it, and praying that the Bill might be amended so that the entire cost of maintaining the new Streets referred to should be defrayed by the Vestry. The Bill shortly afterwards came before a Select Committee of the House of Lords, presided over by the Duke of Richmond, and the objectionable clause was struck out. On the 2nd instant, however, a fresh clause was introduced on behalf of the promoters, which it was proposed to substitute for the one struck out, referring it to an arbitrator, to determine whether the roads should be maintained and lighted at the expense of the Vestry and the Metropolitan Board, or either of them, and in what proportions, but the Chairman of the Committee was of opinion that the proposal would require very careful consideration, and later on the further consideration of the Bill was adjourned until after the Whitsuntide Vacation. The object of this Bill is the better Prevention of Fires in the Metropolis, and the bringing to justice of persons wilfully causing them. It provides for the appointment by the Home Secretary of a Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner to inquire, C2 Fires Prevention (Metropolis) Bill. Hyde Park Corner (New Streets) Bill. 14 with or without a jury, into the causes and circumstances of fires in the Metropolis the origin of which is unknown, or which are considered by the Chief Officer of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade to be a fit subject for inquiry, and where damage exceeding £500 has resulted, the fees of such Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to be paid by the Metropolitan Board out of the rates. The Westminster Board of "Works, in a circular-letter which they forwarded, objected altogether to the principle of the Bill, alleging that it would hamper legislation, occasion great expense, and prove a retrograde measure. This Board, however, was of opinion that the objects sought to be attained by the Bill were good and worthy of support, but that the cost of the proposed inquisitions ought not to be thrown upon the rates, and inasmuch as the Tire Insurance Companies would derive the greatest benefit therefrom, that the cost should be borne by them. The Bill has not yet been read a second time. Delegates. The following members of this Board have been appointed during the year to act as delegates, viz.:—On the subject of the closing of Blackfriars Railway Station, Messrs. Back, Baxter, Geeenwood, Haggis, and Sinclaie; to attend a conference convened by the Vestry of St. Mary, Newington, relative to the obstruction of the highways by costermongers and others, Messrs. Cooksey, Goodwin, Geegoey, Henley, and Hopkins ; to wait upon the Bridges Committee of the Metropolitan Board of Works with reference to the tidal barriers, Bankside, Messrs. Baxteb, Back, Haggis, Pells, and Ridee. The returns of gross and rateable values of property in the Metropolis, forwarded by the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board pursuant to the Valuation of the Metropolis Act, 1869, and which came into force on the 6th April last, show a considerable increase in regard to the Parish of Christchurch. Taking for comparison the returns of rateable value for the years 1885 and 1886, the results are as follows: * Quinquennia Valuation oi the Metropoli * Since the above was written an amended Return has been received from the Asylums Board showing that alterations, consequent upon appeals, have taken place in the assessments, and that the present values are as under:— Christchurch—Rateable value, £104,606 St. Saviour's— „ 221,511 15 Christchurch.. 1885—Rateable value, £90,508 1886— „ 104,590 An increase of £14,082 St. Saviour's. 1885—Rateable value, £222,370 1886— „ 221,182 A decrease of £1,188 In other words, the rateable value of Christchurch has increased 15.55 per cent., while that of St. Saviour's has diminished 0.53 per cent., as compared with last year. The effect will be to relieve St. Saviour's in a corresponding ratio of the burden of such of the charges incurred by this Board as are of the nature of common fund charges, and to transfer it to Christchurch. This will be a distinct gain to St. Saviour's; and, inasmuch as the increased assessments in Christchurch are chiefly in respect of railway property, the general rating of that parish will not be affected thereby. In November last, notice was received from the South Metropolitan Gas Company that from and after Christmas, 1885, the price of Gas supplied by them would be reduced from 2s. 8d. to 2s. 6d. per 1,000 feet, and that concurrently therewith the charge for the public lamps would also be reduced from £3 12s. 6d. to £3 9s. per lamp per annum, less the 5 per cent. discount which is allowed if paid within a month.

The books kept by Mr. Buckwortu, the Board's Inspector of Nuisances, who has charge of the sanitary arrangements, show that the number of persons paying for the accommodation afforded was as under:— MEN'S DEPARTMENT. Water-closets 45,027 Lavatories 6,970 51,997 WOMEN'S DEPARTMENT. Water-closets 20,294 Lavatories 476 20,770 A total of 72,767 persons. 17 In the account referred to, no allowance has been made for the saving effected by the removal of the old urinal which stood in the vicinity, and was superseded by the present structure; nor, on the other hand, has anything been charged for interest on the capital sum expended in erecting and fitting up the Conveniences. These two items, if ascertained, would probably be found to be about equal in amount, and they may, therefore, be considered as a set-off to each other. Resignation of Members, &c. The following changes have occurred consequent upon the 1 ] retirement of members:—In November, 1885, Mr. CoucniiAN, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, resigned his membership, and the Committee appointed Mr. Gregory, and more recently Mr. Angus, as Chairman in his place. In April, 1886, Mr. Botjlden, who had filled the office of Chairman of the Sewers Committee for many years, resigned, in consequence of leaving the district, and the Board passed a resolution expressive of its regret at losing the valuable services of that gentleman. On the 22nd instant, Mr. Josiah Hale was appointed Chairman of the Paving and General Purposes Committee, in lieu of Mr. Rider, who had expressed a desire to retire from the office, in consequence of his election to the Metropolitan Board of "Works, as hereinafter mentioned. Mr. Charles Harris, the esteemed representative of this Board at the Metropolitan Board of Works, being disqualified by serious illness, and the term of three years for which he was last elected having expired by effluxion of time, the Board on the 9th instant held a Special Meeting and appointed Mr. Thomas Francis Rider as his successor. Mr. Harris was one of the oldest members of the District Board, he having been first appointed as a member on the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act in the year 1855. In December of that year, on the promotion of the late Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Thwaites, its first representative, to the Chairmanship of the Metropolitan Board, he was chosen by this Board to succeed him, and at each recurring triennial period ever since he has been unanimously re-elected as a member of the Metropolitan Board. He was also when present invariably called upon to preside at the meetings of this District Board almost from Representation at the Metropolitan Board of Works. 18 its foundation until a comparatively recent period, when he ceased to have a local qualification. At the Special Meeting referred to the District Board passed a resolution thanking Mr. Harms for his valuable services, expressing sympathy with him in his present severe illness, and assuring him of its earnest hope that retirement from tho cares of public life and complete rest might be conducive to his comfort and peace of mind during the closing years of his lifo. It is intended to have such resolution engrossed upon vellum, and to present tho same to him by way of a Testimonial. W. H. ATKINS. BoardA Room, Emerson Street, Bankside, S.E. 24th June, 1886.

The Carriageway of Park Street from Sumner Street to Emerson Place and from South Eastern Wharf to Southwark Bridge has been relaid with new and redressed Granite Pitching, about 620 superficial yards of new 4-inch X 8-inch Guernsey Pitching was laid, and 1,200 superficial yards of old Pitching redressed and relaid. The Carriageway in Southwark Street from Blackfriars Road to the east side of Railway Bridge has been relaid, an area of about 2,000 superficial yards. The Crossings in the Blackfriars Road between Charlotte Street and Great Charlotte Street have been relaid, an area of about 480 superficial yards. The Carriageway of Guildford Street from Union Street to Southwark Street has been relaid, an area of about 1,000 superficial yards. Clink Street.

The Footway in William Street, on the east side, has been William partially paved with new 3-inch York Stone. Stieet. The Granite Curb on the London Bridge Incline between Borough High Street Denman Street and St. Thomas's Street has been taken up, turned, Loudon Bridge redressed, relaid, and a row of 3-inch x 9-incli Guernsey Pitchers Incline, placed against the face of the Curb to protect it from the excessive wear at this spot. During the past year the Footways and Carriageways have been greatly disturbed by Gas and Water Companies, also by the Postal Telegraph Department. These innumerable trenches seriously affect the stability of our roads and footways, and are a source of great expense to this Board. The following Works in connection with the Sewers, &c. have been executed during the year:— In Adam's Place, Red Cross Street, 190 feet run of new 12-inch Stoneware Pipe Sewer has been laid, in order to provide drainage for the new Blocks of Artisans' Dwellings, in course of erection. A new Man-hole has been constructed on the Park Street Sewer, by Messrs. Barclay's main gates. An old high-level Sewer in rear of Charles Street, Blackfriars Road, has been partially abolished. A new Head Wall has been built in a high level Sewer in rear of Park Street, and a 12-inch Galvanized Iron Flap fixed; this has been done in order to prevent the flooding of some cellars in the neighbourhood of the Sewer. A new Concrete Flushing Tank has been constructed at the 24 junction of Brunswick Street and Colling wood Street; this Tank is 18 feet in length, 8 feet 6 inches in height, and 3 feet 9 inches in width, and will contain 3,581 gallons of water. This Tank is connected with the Pipe Sewers in Brunswick Street and Collingwood Street, 400 feet and 590 feet in length respectively. No difficulty has been found in keeping these Sewers in good working order since the construction of the Tank referred to. This is now the third Concrete Flushing Tank we have in Christchurch. The following New Gullies have been constructed:— Name of Street. No. of Gullies.

One new Side Entrance Cover has been fixed. Thirteen new Gully Grates and Frames and six Gully Grates without Frames have been fixed. One new Air-shaft, two Man-hole Covers, and two Galvanized Iron Sewer Flaps have also been fixed. The whole of the Penstocks and Flushing Valves in connection with the river have been maintained in good order, and are used at all stream tides for flushing the Sewers. STREET WATERING. The whole of the old Footway Hydrants have been removed and new Street Watering-posts with swan necks substituted. LIGHTING. The Lamp Column at the west end of Southwark Street has been fitted with four of Sugg's Whitehall Lamps in lieu of the Electric Light formerly there. A large Sugg's Lamp has been placed at the Refuge in the Borough High Street near London Bridge. A Sugg's Lamp has also been placed at the corner of Duke Street. The Lamp Column at the east end of Southwark Street, at the junction with the Borough High Street, will shortly be lighted with four of Sugg's 90-candle power Lamps; the existing old Lamps will be removed, and a far superior light, at the same cost as at present, or even less, will be obtained. GENERAL. Thirty-six Licenses for Hoardings and Scaffolds have been issued. The Carriageways and Footways have been made good in 2,050 cases after Gas and Water Companies' trenches during the past twelve months. No case of overflow from the river has occurred during the year. GEO. ROPER NORRISH. 24th June, 1886. 26 medical officer's report. TO THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT BOARD OF WORKS. Gentlemen, I submit herewith the Statistics of Births and Deaths, and the details of our Sanitary work during the past year. The registered number of Births was 975, 490 occurring in Christchurch, and 485 in St. Saviour. The registered number of Deaths was 626, 355 occurring in Christchurch, and 271 in St. Saviour. Ninety-three deaths occurred in Christchurch Workhouse. The following statement will indicate the Parishes from which they were admitted. St. Saviour. Christchurch. Newington. St. George-theMartyr. 10 14 31 38 The following is a Return of the Deaths of persons who were removed from the District to Public Institutions. They amount to 109, and are comprised as follows:— 27 DISEASES. CHRISTCHURCH. ST SAVIOUR. Totals. Totals.

The corrected death rate will then read 22.4. Small-pox was epidemic throughout the year. A severe outbreak occurred in the Boys' Home in Southwark Street, and 14 boys were removed to the Hospitals under the control of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. All the inmates of the Home were carefully re-vaccinated, and every suspected case was at once isolated in another dwelling. After a period of three months— a period of grave anxiety—the epidemic ceased. Thirty-six cases were removed from other parts of the District, and of this number five terminated fatally, in addition to one fatal case removed from the Boys' Home. 28 Measles was again severely epidemic; 35 deaths were registered from this disease, as against 24 in the previous year. Scarlet Fever caused four deaths, as against two in the previous year. Three cases were removed to the Fever Hospitals. Whooping Cough caused 11 deaths, and Diarrhoea 15, as against 35 and 33 in the previous year. The following is a statement of all the Deaths which occurred in the District from various causes during the year:— DISEASES. CHRISTCHURCH. ST. SAVIOUR. Totals. Totals.

I attended the Sessions House on the 7th October, when Licenses were granted to the applicants. Bakehouses. I inspected the Bakehouses, which number 29. In some instances they were not in conformity with the Act of Parliament, and notices were served to cleanse and whitewash the same. At the end of the year they were again inspected, and in every instance they were found in a satisfactory condition. Underground Rooms. During the past year notices were served to close the undermentioned rooms, they not being in conformity with 18 and 19 Vic. cap. 120, Section 103, viz.: No. 3, George Street, and No. 7, Charlotte Street, both of which are in the parish of Christchurch. These rooms are no longer used as dwelling-rooms. Mortuary. During the year 13 bodies were received into the Mortuary, of this number 11 inquests were held, and the following verdicts were returned:— Apoplexy. Epilepsy. Drowned. Natural Decay. Suffocation. Rupture of Blood Vessel 1 1 3 1 4 1 Disinfection. The following is a list of articles disinfected at the station in Ewer Street during the past year, viz:—128 beds, 69 blankets, 202 pillows, 78 quilts, 143 mattresses, 168 rugs, 207 sheets, and 588 miscellaneous articles. Fifty-eight houses were disinfected with sulphurous acid. Water Supply. I am indebted to Dr. Bernays for the following report on the Water Supply. "The waters of the two companies have maintained a very high standard during the past twelve months. It has been very rarely 33 the case that the waters have not been thoroughly clear, although not quite free from color. More turbidity is caused by the stirring up of impurities in the cisterns on a single occasion than would be found in a month in the waters as delivered by the Companies. "If the public would make use of the permission accorded by the Companies of inserting a tap in the pipe which admits the water to the premises before it passes into the cisterns, so as to be able to draw off a supply of the uncontaminated water for drinking purposes, there would be no ground of complaint except as to cost of the water. "The idea of a separate supply of water for drinking and for washing is too ludicrous to entertain. Apart from the cost, the sanitary portion would not bear investigation. The water would be sure to be drawn from the nearest tap, whether polluted or not, and the difficulty of ascertaining the cause of disease would be greatly increased." Gas. The subjoined tables summarise the results of my testings of the Gas supplied to the District by the South Metropolitan Gas Company. Illuminating power.—Statutory standard 16 candles. Maximum.

Quarter ending March 31st 16.4 15.9 ,, ,, June 30th 16.3 16.0 ,, ,, September 30th 16.3 16.0 ,, ,, December 31st 16.3 16.1 Purity.—Sulphuretted Hydrogen was not present at any time, and Ammonia never reached the prescribed limit of four grains in 100 cubic feet of gas. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 25, Stamford Street, S.E. 1886. 34 PUBLIC ANALYST'S REPORT. TO THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT BOARD OF WORKS. Gentlemen, During the past year I have analysed 48 samples of Milk. Of these, five were adulterated with 28, 23, 19, 10, and 7 per cent., respectively, of added water. A large number were slightly adulterated, but not sufficiently to bring them within the scope of the Act. Of 15 Butters, all have come up to the standard with one exception, and this one sample had 50 per cent. of fat, other than butter-fat, as a part of its composition. Two Lards and two Cheeses were fairly of the nature, substance, and quality demanded; so were also three Breads and two Flours. A so-called Corn Flour consisted entirely of rice flour, and is, consequently, very little nutritious. If sold without any instructions as to the use of milk, it is most objectionable. The price of the article is high. Certainly flour, from rice, is a corn flour; but, as generally understood, a child might die of starvation if fed upon such. Three Mustards were good of their kind. One contained nearly 10 per cent. of turmeric, but was otherwise unobjectionable. Two Peppers were perfectly clean, and of a proper character. Four Coffees have been examined. On obtaining, through the aid of our inspector, a further sample of one, the suspicion of a mixture in the previous sample had quite vanished. Two Teas were very good. 35 On account of the common adulteration of Honey, one sample has been taken, and found to be pure. The amount of pollen was considerable. Phosphoric acid was present in weighable quantities; sulphuric acid was absent. In imitation honey we find the reverse. If the honey were sold as imitation honey, no one would or could complain. Two samples of Drugs, Sulphate of Quinine and Calomel, were found to be excellent. Of Spirits, 10 samples have been analysed. Two of these, a "Whiskey and a Gin, were both diluted; the whiskey was 13 per cent. below the standard, and the gin 8 per cent. It must not be supposed that diluted spirits promote temperance. A person who has been used to spirits of a certain strength is not satisfied with a weaker spirit, and is likely to ask for more. Of Beers, two Porters and two Ales, little can be said. They are well within the mark as to chlorides, and do not contain anything harmful. The certificates are in the possession of our Inspectors. Thanking you for the constant assistance which you have rendered me in carrying out the Act, Believe me, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS.
