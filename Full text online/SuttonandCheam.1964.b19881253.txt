Analytical and Consulting Chemist (Part-time) 1 TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CH EAM Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to, you my sixth and last Annual Report on the health of the Borough. This report for the year 1964 is also the last report for the Borough. It has been prepared in accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular No. 1 of 1965 and is in a somewhat abbreviated form. The estimated population rose by seven hundred and thirty to seventy nine thousand, five hundred. The birth rate was 15.89 per thousand of population. As the comparability factor this year is 1.0 (as in 1963) no adjustment is necessary and the figure compares with a birth rate of 15.64 in 1963. The birth rate in England and Wales was 18.4 per thousand. The death rate was 11.79 per thousand of population (10.26 when adjusted by a comparability factor of 0.87), compared with 13.7 per thousand (11.93 adjusted) in 1963. The death rate for England and Wales was 11.3 per thousand. Death from accidents in 1964 numbered twenty one, of which ten were due to motor vehicle accidents. There were thirteen deaths attributed to suicide. There were fewer cases of infectious diseases and none of Diphtheria, Poliomyelitis, Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers or Meningococcal infection. The Borough's biggest problem, that of housing, has improved by the completion of fifty five units during the year, and the Borough Engineer reports that a further one hundred and eighty two were under construction by the end of the year. Work proceeded at Worcester Park Sewage Works and details provided by the Borough Engineer are given in the report. The Sutton District Water Company supplied an unrestricted quantity of pure wholesome softened water throughout the year. The Metropolitan Water Board supplies a small number of houses in the Northern part of the Borough. The Borough's first two Smoke Control Areas became operational on the 1st October. The survey of Area Number 3 was completed and is expected to come into operation on the 1st November, 1965. The survey of Area Number 4 commenced towards the end of the year. The work of the sanitary supervision of the Borough and the protection of food and on clean air was efficiently carried out by Mr. A.S. Williams, Chief Public Health Inspector. I thank him for his collaboration during the year and for his report. As he is retiring at the end of March 2 next year I take this opportunity to wish him a long and happy retirement My thanks are also due. and are gladly given, to the inspectorial, clerical and outdoor staff of the Health Department for their work during the year, and in very many cases, during the period of my office. I wish them success and happiness in their work for the new Borough of Sutton. The same thanks and sentiments apply also to all the Chief and other Officers of other Departments of the Council I should like to take this opportunity to say 'Thank you' to medical and other colleagues in general practice, hospitals and laboratories, in or serving the Borough, and to County and County Divisional staff for all the help and co operation experienced during this and previous years of my term of office Before closing, I should like to wish my friend and colleague, Dr. Peter Westcombe, as much happiness in his post as Medical Officer of Health of the new Borough of Sutton as I have enjoyed as Medical Officer of Health of part of his new area Finally, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank you for your support during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor. Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN C.

HEALTH EDUCATION Health education continued during the year as part of the normal duties of all members of the staff during their routine visits and day to day work. In addition, the following subjects were dealt with:- 7 (i) Smoking and Lung Cancer New posters were widely distributed during the year. The mobile anti-smoking unit which visited Sutton and Cheam in 1963 paid another fleeting visit during 1964 to Sutton East County Secondary School and Sutton Common Secondary Girls' School, (ii) Vaccination and Immunisation A poster on routine immunisation was distributed, and three thousand leaflets placed in the public libraries, (iii) Articles An article entitled 'Health and Prevention of Disease in Middle Age was written for a Ratepayers' Gazette (iv) Home Safety The Sutton and Cheam Home Safety Committee continued its valuable work., supported by a grant from the Council, under its active President, Alderman Mrs. D Sparks, M.B.E., and Chairman, Mr. H. Halls. Mrs. I.L. Ashmore, of 243, Brighton Road, Belmont, (Telephone Number Vigilant 5474), continued as Hon. Secretary. Posters, leaflets and bookmarks were again distributed and speakers were provided for schools and local organisations. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS One hundred and nine medical examinations of staff were undertaken during the year, consisting of ninety one for superannuation purposes and eighteen sick pay cases for reports to the Establishment Committee. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948 and 1951 Section 47 (Removal of Persons in Need of Care and Attention) No action was necessary under this section during the year. Local Health Authority Services, such as the District Nursing and Home Help Services help to keep old people in their own homes as long as possible. In addition, the Old People's Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Service also do a great deal to help old people remain in their homes as long as possible. They provide Meals on Wheels, and a visiting service for old people, which it is hoped will be expanded They also run a chiropody service for old people, the cost of which is reimbursed by the Surrey County Council, Section 50 (Burial and Cremation of the Dead) Two burials were arranged under the power's granted to the Council by this Section 8 MORTUARY During 1964, two hundred and two bodies were admitted and underwent post mortem examination. The standard of service and hygiene has continued at the very high level indicated in last year's report following the appointment of a full time mortuary superintendent It is very likely that housing accommodation on the site will be available in the coming year. LABORATORIES The Public Health Laboratory, Epsom, served the Borough for bacteriological examinations, This service is supplemented by the use of the laboratories at Sutton and Cheam Hospital and St. Helier Hospital. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply. The water supply is mainly derived from the deep wells in the chalk of the Sutton District Water Company situated at Sutton, Cheam and Woodmansterne. A small area in the North Ward is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water from all the wells of the Sutton District Water Company is softened to under nine degrees of hardness. A high dose of chlorine in the form of chloramine is administered to the water as a protective measure. Most of it is removed later, leaving a small residual chloramine to pass out to public distribution. The water is not liable to be plumbo-solvent. The fluoride content is reported to be less than 0.1 part per million. Samples of the raw and treated waters are examined daily by the laboratory at the Sutton Works. Samples are also examined at monthly intervals by the Company's Consultant Analyst, and copies of his reports are received. Twenty four bacteriological and twelve chemical samples are taken annually by the five District Councils in the area of supply (two bacteriological and one chemical per month, in rotation). All samples were satisfactory. The supply from all sources has been satisfactory in quality and quantity No action was necessary in respect of contamination during the year. All the dwelling houses have a direct supply from the public mains, as follows:- (a) Twenty six thousand, four hundred and eighty one houses, with a population of seventy nine thousand, four hundred and ninety two, are supplied to a tap directly into the house. (b) Five houses, with a population of eight, are supplied by standpipes. The Sutton District Water Company supply twenty six thousand, and forty-eight dwellings, and the remaining four hundred and thirty-eight dwellings are supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. 9 Swimming Baths There are two public swimming baths in Sutton and Cheam. The Maiden Road Bath, Cheam, was opened in 1938, and so is reasonably modern. It is open between April and September, and in Winter it is converted into a fine public hall. The Throwley Road Bath, Sutton, is much older and has changing cubicles round the sides of the bath. It is open all the year round Maiden Road Bath Throwley Road Bath Maximum Clothes Accommodation 312 250 Quantity of Water 150,000 gallons 70,000 gallons Treatment Cycle Time 3½ hours 3½A hours 10 The following is an average monthly analysis - Chemical Results in Parts per Million Average Appearance Bright with a slight white deposit of minute particles of calcium carbonate.

Zinc. Copper, Lead Absent Bacteriological Results No of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 1 day at 37°C 0 No. of colonies developing on Agar per ml for 2 days at 37°C 0 No of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 3 days at 20-22°C 0 Presence of Bacillus Coli in 100 ml 0 Both work on a continuous cycle of pressure filtration and chlorinat.ion, the actual water being emptied out once a year and the Baths being refilled with mains water. Records are kept at both Baths showing the number of bathers, water temperature and residual chlorine levels at various times during the day and from these it was clear that an adequate degree of chlorination was being maintained. Two bacteriological samples were taken from the Maiden Road Bath and four from the Throwley Road Bath. All six samples were reported as satisfactory In addition there is an open air learner swimming bath at Avenue Road County Primary School, Belmont Rise, Belmont. A small pressure filter and chlorinator was in use and a complete circulation of water was obtained every eight hours. One sample of the water was taken for bacteriological examination and found to be satisfactory. DRAINAGE, SEWERAGE AND REFUSE COLLECTION I am indebted to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor for supplying information for items (a) to (d) following. (a) Worcester Park Sewage Works The new Generating Station block, including workshop, messroom and stores, became operational in October and the plant is now capable of providing all power for the pumping and treatment plant. A contract for reconstruction of Filter Beds and provision of additional Humus Tanks which commenced in October 1963 is proceeding and the first group of four filter beds was commissioned late in the year. The remaining six filter beds will be commenced in stages during 1965. The two additional Humus Tanks are nearing completion and should become operational in February, 1965. Nine thousand square yards of sludge drying beds, constructed in the first two Contracts for this work, have been brought into use and the results obtained have been most satisfactory. A further Contract for Sludge Drying Beds will be commenced in the Spring of 1965. The effluent discharged to the Beverley Brook during the year has suffered somewhat in quality due to the number of filter beds available for use being reduced during construction of the new filter beds. (b) Sutton Sewage Works Minor improvements have been carried out to the treatment plant during the year and the effluent discharged to the Pyl Brook has normally been of good quality (c) Drainage Contract 1 of the Sutton Common Area Relief Surface Water Scheme which provided for laying a new sewer across Morden Park was completed early in the year, Contract 2 of this scheme which will include sewer work in Elm Road West, Woodstock Avenue, Sutton Common Road. Woodstock Rise, Midway and Chatham Close will commence in January, 1965. 11 (d) Refuse Collection and Cleansing The refuse collection and disposal service has functioned reasonably satisfactorily throughout the year. A paper sack method of refuse storage in place of dustbins has been brought into satisfactory use at some Council housing projects, (e) Closet Accommodation There is only one cesspool in use in the Borough, and one septic tank. Since 1928, one hundred and sixty three premises, originally with cesspool drainage, have been connected to sewers. Only two pail closets and three chemical closets are in use, not including those in temporary use on new building sites. (f) Rivers and Streams The streams within the Borough have been maintained in a satisfactory condition 12 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector under Regulation 25(20) of the Public Health Officers Regulations 1959 (Pages 13 to 45) RECORD OF INSPECTIONS MADE, COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED AND NOTICES SERVED Visits Animal Boarding Establishments 8 Advisory: Housing & Public Health: Special Inspections .... 1,340 Bakehouses 14 Butchers: Grocers: Greengrocers: Fishmongers, etc. 819 Cinemas: Theatres: Halls 2 Clean Air Act: Smoke observations: Deposit gauges: Volumetric, enquiries etc. 473 Clean Air Act, Smoke Control Areas - Survey visits and revisits 3,570 Dairies: Milk Purveyors 32 Factories: Workplaces 189 Food & Drugs Act sampling 184 Food Poisoning enquiries 13 Hairdressers & Barbers premises 11 Heating Appliances (Consumers Protection Act, 1961) – Hospitals: Schools - spraying of kitchens – Houses in Multiple Occupation 26 Ice Cream, Manufacture, storage and sale of 52 Ice Cream sampling (Bacteriological) 81 Infectious Diseases 192 Licensed Public Houses 5 Merchandise Marks Act 103 Milk/Water sampling (Bacteriological) 115 Miscellaneous 3,073 Noise Nuisances - Investigations 261 Offices, Shops & Railway Premises 4 Outworkers premises 73 Overcrowding: Permitted Numbers 281 Pet Animals Act 10 Rag Flock Act – Re-inspections 1,969 Restaurants: Cafe Kitchens: Dining Rooms etc. 94 Rodent Control Inspections 5,434 School & Public conveniences 56 Schools/Industrial Canteen Kitchens 17 Shops under Shops Act 319 Spraying of premises - various insect pests 9 Stables: Piggeries: Passages: Ditches 193 Verminous Premises 2 TOTAL19,024 Number of complaints received and investigated 652 Premises at which defects :or nuisances were discovered 1,706 Number of defects or nuisances discovered 2,268 " " " " " remedied 2,105 " " " " " in hand 29 " " " " " outstanding 134 Number of informal notices served 151 13 Statutory Notices were served as under:- Public Health Act, 1936, Section 24 16 " " " " " 29 – " " " " " 45 – " " " " " 75 – " " " 1961, " 17 – Sutton & Cheam Corporation Act 1951 - Section 42 – Clean Air Act, 1956 - Section 12(2) 21 Housing Act, 1957 - Section 159 17 TOTAL 54 SUMMARY OF REMEDIAL WORKS AND SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS CARRIED OUT Drainage and Sanitary Fittings:- Number of houses and other premises re-drained - Number of houses and other premises connected to soil and/or surface water sewers - Repairs and amendments to existing drains (865 feet laid) 43 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed (involving 1540 premises) 667 Sanitary fittings repaired/renewed/provided or cleansed 265 Water service pipes/cisterns/repaired/renewed or cleansed 5 Water, smoke and chemical tests applied 84 W.C.

Eight complaints of smoke emission were received and dealt with during the year, seven of these were in respect of bonfires, and one from industrial plants. Grit Deposit Measuring Gauges In conjunction and with the co-operation of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the grit deposit measuring gauges have been maintained and samples collected monthly for analytical examination. The Borough is adequately covered by three grit deposit gauges which are sited roughly 1½ miles apart. The following is a summary of the results obtained during the year:- Gauge No. 2 Gauge No. 6 Gauge No. 7 MONTH Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) January 0.55 10.11 0.55 13.57 0.63 12.21 February 1.02 11.07 1.14 8.89 0.98 9.36 March 2.54 10.24 2.80 15.48 2.54 11.58 April 3.47 13.99 3.66 9.48 3.27 8.67 May 2.01 16.84 2.01 12.44 2.01 9.07 June 4.20 18.08 3.90 10.60 4.57 9.84 July 2.09 11.43 1.97 * 1.66 8.77 August 1.46 8.98 1.81 8.54 1.50 7.75 September 0.55 6.62 0.59 23.64 0.43 5.03 October 0.89 8.55 1.02 7.64 1.39 8.87 November 1 49 12.16 1.54 16.10 1.34 7.43 December 1.61 10.63 1.53 12.55 1.38 8.94 Totals 21 88 138.70 22.52 138,93 21.70 107.52 Monthly Average 1964 1 82 11.55 1.87 12.63 1.81 8.96 1963 2,0 11.12 2.02 8.84 1.86 8.70 1962 1.81 10.57 1.97 10.30 1.80 7.47 1961 1.90 9.39 2.01 7.70 1.75 6.98 1960 2.59 10.62 2.79 10.77 2.44 8.97 * Presence of foreign matter due to vandalism 20 DAILY MEAN CONCENTRATION OF SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE A daily record has been kept since the 1st November, 1958 of the amount of smoke or suspended matter and sulphur dioxide in the air by means of a smoke filter and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus installed in Manor Park House. It has long been recognised that a distinction must be drawn between relatively coarse particles of solid matter which are quickly deposited by their own weight, and which comprise most of the particulate matter collected in the deposit gauge, and the very fine particles which settle slowly, if at all. These fine particles, commonly referred to as 'smoke', are less than about 20 microns (0.002 cm) in size and consist largely of carbonaceous matter, including tar, produced by the incomplete combustion of coal; some fine ash is also included. It is important to realise that little of this fine material is collected in the deposit gauge which in consequence gives no information about pollution by smoke. To obtain such information a smoke filter is necessary. The following table gives a summary of the daily readings taken during the year 1964.

No declaration made or notice to this effect exhibited in the shop. Manager apparently unaware that the seasoning used contained preservative. Notices now exhibited. 3542 (Informal) Calamine Cream Labelling The description of this article as calamine cream implied that it is of B.P.C. standard, whereas it contained far more calamine and zinc oxide than the B.P.C. preparation and is made accordingly to a very different formula Manufacturer ininformed of infringement and agreed that the labels would be changed when reprinted. 3553 (Informal) Dehydrated Pepper Flakes Labelling This article contained 550 parts per million by weight of sulphur dioxide which is within the limit permitted by the Preservatives in Food Regulations, 1962, but is an ingredient and must be specified on the label as such as required by the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. The importers have now taken the matter up with the American Canners. 3597 (Informalj Minced Turkey This article was not of the quality demanded. The lid was rusted on the underside and the surface of the meat underneath the protecting paper disc, contained particles of dark meat and the base of a feather. The bulk of the meat was in a satisfactory condition. No remaining stock in shop when visited. Retailer warned regarding stock rotation. 3604 (Informal) Canned Bilberries Labelling Article should have been desscribed on the label as "Canned Bilberries in Syrup", and the minimum amount of bilberries in the can should have been not less than 8/4 ozs, whereas the estimated weight was not more than 8 ozs. The Scottish Canners gave assurance that arrangements were in hand to collect stocks which, through no fault of their own have a low drained weight, as they were filled according to the Canners Association Code of Practise. Sampling Observations It will be seen from the detailed classification that of the two hundred and twenty three samples taken during the year, the Public Analyst reported four labelling infringements (1,79%) and one sample for another type of irregularity (0.45%) making a total of five samples. (2.24%). 28 The pattern of sampling has followed that of previous years, in that a wide range and variety of articles have been selected for analysis, and it is encouraging and worthy of mention that the few infringements found were on the whole of a minor character, and amicably settled without recourse to legal proceedings. 29 PUBLIC ANALYST'S COMMENTS, 1964. This year has seen a considerable activity in legislation and preparation for legislation on Food & Drugs. The more important Regulations which have been made under the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, have been in connection with Meat, Soft Drinks, Dried Milk and Mineral Hydrocarbons in Food, and a word or two about each of them will perhaps convey more to readers of these comments than any considerable discussion of individual samples submitted. All new Regulations are taken into account as soon as they come into force. The Meat (Treatment) Regulations were made in a great hurry following reports of several cases of apparent poisoning as a result of the use of 'dusting powders' on raw meat These powders, which contained nicotinic acid, vitamin C and dextrose, were applied to meat to maintain the red colour of fresh meat and their use was deceptive and could mask deterioration Nicotinic acid when used in limited quantities and properly distributed is harmless but an excess gives rise to an unpleasant condition involving flushing of the face and neck with tingling and irritation. There are no permanently harmful effects The use of these powders obviously had to be controlled and, by these Regulations they are forbidden. The Soft Drinks Regulations These are not yet fully in force, but they will help to control the use of terms such as 'squash' and 'crush', and they will provide for the sale of semi-sweet drinks with lower sugar or sugar and saccharin contents. If saccharin is used in any drink it will have to be declared Unfortunately there is no requirement to specify the fruit or fruit juice content which, from the consumers point of view is wholly desirable. The Dried Milk Regulations prescribe new minimum and maximum fat contents for the various grades of dried milk, maximum moisture contents and labelling requirements. The Mineral Oil in Food Regulations lay down a specification of purity for any oil used in food in accordance with the Regulations. . The extension of the permitted amount of paraffin in chewing compound to 60% appears to me personally to be unnecessary and undesirable. In addition to these Regulations, proposals for Regulations have been issued for the purpose of standardising the meat content of canned meat products and meat pies. The Food Standards Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has also issued Reports and Recommendations reviewing the use of colouring matters in food (it is recommended that 6 colours in the existing permitted list be withdrawn and one added) and, in preparation for a revision of the Labelling of Food Order, 1953, a First Report on Food Labelling. This latter is of major importance to all who buy food and it is encouraging to those of us who have always advocated that the maximum of information as to the nature of the food should be given on a label that the Committee has adopted this principle in all its deliberations and, in particular, has recommended that wherever 'additives' have been used they should be declared. Amongst numerous others, the Committee has made recommendations as follows (1) That the addition of tenderisers to both pre-packed and non-prepacked meat should be declared. 30 (2) That the use of the word 'Champagne' in reference to Cider and Perry should be prohibited. (3) That the use of the word 'Vintage' should be confined to wines and not used for cider. (4) That the word 'Instant' should not be used adjectivally in the description of foods (but exception is made for 'Instant Coffee'). (5) That standard nomenclature be adopted for pre-packed fish and meat pastes. (6) and that Food Vending Machines should carry a clear statement of contents. It remains to be seen whether all or even most of these numerous recommendations will be translated in due course into Official Regulations, but it is indicative of the times and shows a trend of thought which reflects the views of many of those who are most anxious about consumer protection. Drugs of a more modern nature have not perhaps received the attention they should have done in recent years, but several now appear in the list of Foods and Drugs sampled by the Borough's Sampling Officers during the year, and it is satisfactory to note that none were found to be irregular. Most of these preparations are manufactured by firms of national repute. MILK SUPPLY Food and Drugs Act, 1955 The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963. The Borough of Sutton and Cheam is a specified area for the purpose of the "Milk (Special Designations)(Specified Areas) Order, 1951", therefore all milk sold in the Borough is designated Milk. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1963 re-enacted with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960. The principal changes are that on and after 1st October, 1964:— (a) ''UNTREATED" replaces "Tuberculin Tested" as the special designation for raw milk. (b) The Methylene Blue test replaces the Clot-on-Boiling test as the test for untreated milk to which a producer's licence relates. (c) A general licence is granted to certain producers who sell milk produced from herds owned or controlled by them in the course of catering sales at or from the premises where the herds ar e maintained: this licence is subject to conditions substantially similar to those applying to other producers' licences, save that the quantity of milk to which the licence applies is restricted to 50 gallons in any one year. (d) A producer's licence, granted for a temporary purpose and valid for one month only, is introduced. 31 From 29th September, 1963 until 31st December, 1964, a person holding the appropriate licence could use the words "Tuberculin" Tested Milk (Pasteurised)" as an alternative to the words "Pasteurised Milk" in relation to milk which has been pasteurised. From 1st October, 1964, until 31st December, 1964 milk could be labelled as ' Tuberculin Tested" if the conditions applicable to the use of the special designation 'Untreated" were otherwise satisfied. Nine licences were issued in 1964, authorising the use of Special Designations, and these together with previous licences issued from 1961 onwards will expire on the 31st December, 1965. The total number of licences issued up to the end of 1964 being 64 as shewn below:- 1964 1963 1962 1961 Total Dealer's Pre-packed Tuberculin Tested/Untreated Pasteurised and Sterilised 1 2 - 27 30 Tuberculin Tested/Untreated, and Pasteurised 1 - - 1 2 Tuberculin Tested/Untreated 2 - - 1 3 Pasteurised and sterilised - - 1 2 3 Pasteurised 3 1 2 3 9 Sterilised 2 1 1 11 15 Dealer's Tuberculin Tested - - - 1 1 Dealer's Pasteuriser's - - - 1 1 Total 9 4 4 47 64 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK SAMPLES One hundred and one samples of milk were examined as follows Class of Milk No. of samples examined Type of Test applied Passed Results Failed Void Pasteurised 46 Phosphatase 46 - - Methylene Blue 44 2 - Sterilised 7 Turbidity 7 - - Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 25 Phosphatase 25 - - Methylene Blue 24 1 - Tuberculin Tested (Untreated) (Farm Bottled) 23 Methylene Blue 17 6 _ Totals 101 92 9 - To comply with the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963, samples of 'Pasteurised' and Tuberculin Tested' Milk on arrival at the testing laboratory shall at once be removed from the insulated container and stored as follows:— 32 (a) A sample taken at any time during the period from 1st May to 31st October inclusive shall be kept at atmospheric shade temperature until 9.30 a.m on the following day. (b) A sample taken at any time during the period from 1st November to 30th April inclusive shall be kept in its original container, or in a sterile 3 oz. sample bottle at atmospheric shade temperature until 5.0 p.m. on the day of sampling and thereafter at a constant temperature of 65°F + 2°F until 9.30 a.m. on the following day. The Methylene Blue test shall be begun between 9.30 a.m. and 10 a.m. on the day after the sample is taken, but the test shall NOT be applied if during the period of storage at atmospheric shade temperature this temperature at any time exceeds 70°F. The test shall be deemed to be satisfied by milk which fails to decolourise methylene blue in thirty minutes. Six samples of Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) Milk, one T.T. (Pasteurised) and two Pasteurised Milks failed the test. The dairy companies concerned were notified immediately of the failures in order that the matter could be taken up with the responsible producers as speedily as possible. The 'Phosphatase' test for Pasteurised Milk shall be deemed to be satisfied by milk which gives a reading of 10g or less of p-nitrophenol/ml of milk. Seventy-one samples were subjected to this test and found to be satisfactory. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF MILK AND CREAM SAMPLES MILK Forty-three formal and twenty-nine informal samples of milk were taken for chemical analysis; all were found to be genuine. Eighteen samples of 'Channel Island' milk contained satisfactory averages of 4.38% milk fat and 8.93% milk solids other than milk fat; fifty-four other samples of milk contained satisfactory averages of 3.60% milk fat and 8,66% milk solids other than milk fat. The results were well above the minimum standard of 4% milk fat laid down in the Milk & Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations 1956; and of 3% milk fat and 8.5% milk solids other than milk fat required under The Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939. CREAM Analysis of six informal samples of cream showed one double cream sample to contain 50.3% milk fat and five single cream samples a satisfactory average of 22.94% milk fat. The minimum standards in relation to cream are as follows 'double cream' not less than 48% by weight of milk fat. and 'other creams' described as single cream, pouring cream, coffee cream, fruit cream, or as any other description of cream - not less than 18% by weight of milk fat. 33 ICE CREAM Food and Drugs Act, 1955 fee Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1959 Food Standards (Ice Crean) Regulations, 1959 Registrations: Du ing the year one application for the registration of premises for the sale and storage of ice cream was received and granted. At the end of 1964 a total of one hundred and seventy-one premises had been registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, and on five of these premises ice cream could be manufactured. BACTERIOLOGICAL SAMPLING OF ICE CREAM During the year sixty one samples of ice cream were obtained for bacteriological examination and provisional grading. The following table shows the 1964 percentage results in each grade and for comparative purposes the results obtained in 1963.

The Regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (Kosher) ice and introduce separate standards for dairy ice cream (or dairy cream ice or cream ice) and for milk ice, The standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice provide that they shall contain no fat other than milk fat except such as may be introduced by the use of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent The requirements in the 1953 Order that ice cream should contain not less than 10% of sugar is replaced by a provision that no type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener. Alternative standards are prescribed for certain descriptions of ice cream containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree. The standard of composition for ice cream is as follows:— (a) Ice cream shall contain not less than 5% fat and 7½% milk solids other than fat (b) Ice cream containing any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall either conform to (a) above or, alternatively the total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12/4% of the whole including the fruit etc. and such total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½% fat and 2% milk solids other than fat. (c) Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice, or cream ice shall in each case contain not less than 5% milk fat and no other fat (except as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7½% milk solids other than fat (d) Milk Ice or milk ice containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall contain not less than 2½% milk fat and no other fat (save as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7% milk solids other than fat 14 samples of locally produced ice cream were submitted to chemical examination during the year and found to contain constituent percentages above the prescribed standard, as under Sample No. Constituent Percentages Fat % Milk solids other than fat % 3475 9.7 14.0 3483 12.2 14.5 3515 6.5 10.0 3516 5.7 12.0 3517 11 .4 14 0 3534 7.0 10.0 3535 10.4 13.0 3541 10.1 14.5 3565 11.1 10.0 3566 8 7 13.0 3600 7.6 10 0 3601 12.6 13.0 3618 7.1 9.5 3619 13.5 14.0 Average 9.54 12 25 35 ICE LOLLIES BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION There is no prescribed standard for water ices or ice lollies sold as such, but as in former years ice lolly samples have been submitted to a test similar to the one applied to ice cream. 31 lollies were examined and found to be satisfactory. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 These regulations which came into operation on the 1st October, 1960 amend and consolidate the Food Hygiene Regulations 1955 to 1957. A number of amendments have been embodied in the general provisions of the Regulations in the light of the experience gained since they first came into operation The most important of these amendments are described below - (a) The term "catering business" has been introduced into regulations 25(2) (temperature at which certain foods are to be kept) and 28(1) (supply of water to stalls), in order to indicate more clearly the type of business to which these requirements apply. (b) The definition of "meat" has been extended to include rabbits, game and poultry. (c) The scope of the expression "handling of food" is widened so that the obligation of food handlers will in future extend to persons who wash up or clean food equipment. (d) Herbal smoking mixture and snuff are now included with tobacco, which a person engaged in the handling of food shall refrain from using whilst he is handling open food or is in any food room in which there is open food. (e) Regulation 26 as amended makes it clear that food transport and delivery vehicles have to be kept clean and in good condition, and suitably and sufficiently lighted when being cleaned. A proviso has been added to permit the driving compartment of a stall or vehicle to be used as a sleeping place if it is effectively separated from the food compartment The following is a summary of the number of food premises in the Borough - Bakehouses 12 Butchers (including one horseflesh shop) 61 Confectioners (sugar and flour) 180 Fishmongers/stalls/fried fish shops 25 General stores/shops 18 Greengrocers/stalls/stores 90 Grocers 120 Ice Cream (Manufacture and sale of) 182 Licensed Public Houses 32 Milk Purveyors/Depots/Dairies 39 Restaurants/cafes/snack bars/dining rooms 59 School and Industrial canteens/ kitchens/service rooms 48 Other Food Premises 19 TOTAL 885 36 During the year 1136 visits were made to food business premises, 12 notices were served in connection with 22 infringements discovered, and 41 infringements (including 32 discovered in 1963) were rectified. Prosecutions Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 to 1960 No proceedings were taken during the year under these Regulations. Food Complaints Investigation of the following complaints made by purchasers during the year did not warrant proceedings being taken, but appropriate action was taken in each case as found to be necessary.

Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 One licence to act as a slaughterman was granted in 1964 to the R.S.P.C.A. Inspector. Bakehouses There are thirteen bakehouses in the Borough. With one exception, all are provided with mechanical power. The standard of cleanliness and sanitary conditions in the majority of cases were found to be satisfactory as revealed by the visits of inspection made during the year. Shops Act 319 visits were made to various premises under the Shops Act and revealed that the arrangements made for the health and comfort of the shop workers are in the majority of cases satisfactory. Schools The sanitary conditions and the water supply to the Schools in the area were found to be generally satisfactory. 39 Hairdressers9 and Barbers5 Premises There are seventynine establishments in the Borough. The premises generally were found to conform to the requirements of the Hairdressers and Barbers Bye-Laws, 1947. Merchandise Marks Act One hundred and three visits were made to food premises under this Act. The infringements discovered were principally in connection with the marking of imported apples, tomatoes and dead poultry. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 The intention of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling material in upholstered articles, and other articles which are stuffed or lined. The Act provides for the registration of certain premises by the Local Authority on payment of a registration fee and the licensing of certain other premises on payment of a statutory fee. No applications to store rag flock were received during the year. Pet Animals Act, 1951 This Act came into operation on 1st April, 1952, and provides that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted by the Local Authority in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. Seven licence renewal applications and one new application for a licence was received and granted during 1964. Licenced Places of Public Entertainment There are sixteen licensed places of public entertainment in the Borough. They are used mainly for cinematograph shows, concerts, dancing and social functions. The general Standard of cleanliness was found to be well maintained. Licenced Public Houses 5 visits of inspection were made to the 32 licensed public houses in the Borough. As a result of inspections under the Food Hygiene Regulations a considerable number of improvements have been carried out at many public houses. These include the provision of additional or improved sanitary conveniences, wash basins, hot water supply, improved ventilation to kitchens, bars and cellars and the more general use of detergents and sterilising agents for the washing of utensils beer pipe lines and pumps. 40 Noise Abatement Act, I960 Under Section 1 of this Act which came into operation on the 27th November, 1960, noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. Local Authorities will under this procedure be able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of premises on which it arises and if the notice is not complied with it can be enforced by proceedings in a magistrates court. Apart from action by a local authority, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make a complaint to a magistrate. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. (except in special circumstances) and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment with the exception that between noon and 7 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are for sale. The loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. Six complaints of noise were investigated and satisfactorily dealt with during the year. 41 Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 This is an Act to make fresh provision for securing the health, safety and welfare of persons employed to work in office or shop premises and provision for securing the health, safety and welfare of persons employed to work in certain railway premises; to amend certain provisions of the Factories Act, 1961; and for purposes connected with matters aforesaid. Certain sections of the Act including the requirement to register premises came into force on 1st May, 1964, but most of the main provisions came into force on 1st August, 1964.

Table F - Inspectors Number of Inspectors appointed under Section 52(1) or (5) of the Act:- Nil. Number of other staff employed for most of their time on work in connection with the Act:- 1 Clerical Officer. It has not been possible for various reasons to forge ahead with the inspections under the Act in the Borough - not the least of which is a shortage of Staff - but it is anticipated that the new establishment of the London Borough of Sutton will allow for staff to be available for enforcement of the Act from 1st April, 1965. Disinfection and Disinfestation Council Private Other Houses Houses Premises Number of premises treated with insecticides for bugs and fleas The insecticides used were Pybuthrin, D.D.T., Residual and Municipal Spray, Gammexane Liquid Spray, ZaldecideM. Powder and Fumex Fumigators. 43 RODENT CONTROL The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 A Surface Treatments (1) 4800 visits were made during the year by the Rodent Operator and 634 by the Public Health Inspectors to premises infested or possibly harbouring rats or mice. 409 premises were cleared of rats or mice and no major infestations were recorded (2 The work for the year is generally summarised as under:- Complaints received or cases discovered and investigated 481 Number of premises found to be infested 412 Number of premises where no evidence of rodents found 69 Number of premises cleared of rats or mice (including 31 previous year's cases) 409 Number of premises still being treated at the year end 34 (3) The cause or site of infestation at the 412 infested premises was:- Keeping of poultry Inside premises (under floors etc.) - rats 23 Inside premises (under floors etc.) - mice 27 Buries, scrapes, etc., in gardens, land, etc 207 Under or inside sheds 154 Defective drains 1 TOTAL 412 (4) Type of premises found to be infested:- With Rats With Mice Total Council Property 9 - 9 Dwelling-Houses 342 9 351 Business premises etc 17 14 31 Schools, Hospitals, Canteens, etc. 2 5 7 Land 14 - 14 TOTAL 384 28 412 (5) Summary of the type of premises and methods employed in clearing premises of rats and mice:- Type of Premises cleared Dwelling-Houses (Mainly in gardens) 353 Food shops and food premises 13 Non-food shops 4 Waste Land and building sites 13 Hospitals and Schools 6 Factories and Workplaces 5 Council Premises (other than dwellings) 8 Miscellaneous 7 44 TOTAL 409 The methods employed in clearing premises of rats and mice were as follows - Warfarin and other Poison Baits 409 Rat and Mouse Proofing Drains repaired Gassing TOTAL 409 B. Sewer Treatments (1) Treatment No. 34 - Second Maintenance Treatment (1963-64) The second maintenance Treatment of soil sewer manholes was completed on the 26th March, 1964. As in the past the Anticoagulant poison - Warfarin 0.5% Master Mx was used with pinhead oatmeal, technical white oil, caster sugar and paranitrophenol (mould inhibitor) as a bait base. Rebaiting of all infested manholes continued until no bait takes were recorded. The following is a summary of the results obtained:- Number of Sections A B C D E Total Manholes baited - 1st visit 14 57 61 77 33 242 Complete takes - 2nd visit 2 - 5 3 4 14 Partial takes - 2nd visit - - 6 - 5 11 Complete takes - 3rd visit - - - - 1 1 Partial takes - 3rd visit - - 1 - 1 2 All takes - 4th visit Nil (2) First Maintenance Treatment 1964/65 Owing to the prolonged illness of the Rodent Operator and shortage of staff it was found necessary to cancel this treatment. However a full treatment will be carried out in March, 1965 prior to this work being taken over by the London Borough of Sutton.

Scarlet Fever Sixteen cases were notified in 1964, as against thirty six in 1963 There were twelve cases in the first quarter, two in the second quarter, and one in each of the third and fourth quarters. The illness remained mild and there were no deaths. The less exacting control of Scarlet Fever continued, thus causing less interference with school attendance of cases and contacts, and is justified whilst the illness remains so mild. Diphtheria No case was notified during the year. The last case in Sutton and Cheam occurred in 1951. Diphtheria Antitoxin The possibility of Diphtheria must still always be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of infections of the throat. The early injection of antitoxin is the most effective treatment of Diphtheria. Swabs for diagnosis should be taken before any antibiotic is administered. Any suspected cases are best admitted to isolation hospital at once for diagnosis and treatment. Diphtheria Immunisation Diphtheria Immunisation has again been shown to be very necessary by a number of small outbreaks of Diphtheria in the country, including the London area. Children should be immunised before the age of twelve months, and if Triple Antigen is used, which is very desirable, immunisation should be started as early as the second or third month, with reinforcing doses at fifteen to eighteen months, school entry, and at age eight to ten years. Immunisation is free of charge for children under sixteen years of age, and can be arranged through the family doctor or at Child Welfare and School Clinics. During 1964, one thousand, one hundred and seventy nine children received a primary course of immunisation as follows:- Children Born in Years:- 1964 1963 1962 1961 1960 1955- 1950- 1959 1954 Total Number Immunised:- 547 510 46 13 2 55 6 1179 In addition, two thousand, three hundred and thirty three children received reinforcing injections. Measles One hundred and sixty four cases were notified in 1964 compared with nine hundred and seventy six cases in 1963. There was no death Twenty cases occurred in the first quarter, sixty seven in the second, twenty one in the third and fifty six in the fourth quarter of the year. The illness can be prevented or modified by the injection of gamma globulin early in the incubation period. A small quantity is available to doctors for cases of special risk Health Visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. 46 Whooping Cough Sixteen cases were notified in 1964, compared with thirty six cases in 1963 There was no death. Whooping Cough is a serious infection in early infancy. The danger of mortality is highest in the first three months of life and diminishes with age Every effort should be made to protect babies and weakly infants from contact with infection. The vaccines give substantial protection. Immunisation should commence rot later than three months of age. Health Visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. Immunisation against Whooping Cough Immunisation against Whooping Cough is available free of charge for children under five years of age, either through the family doctor or at Child Welfare Clinics. Three injections are given at monthly intervals. The injections are preferably combined with immunisation against Diphtheria and Tetanus, and should be commenced as early as the second or third month. In 1964, one thousand, one hundred and seventeen children received a primary course of immunisation. Smallpox No case was notified. Vaccination against Smallpox The speed of travel has increased the risk of importing Smallpox. There is as yet no drug accepted as a cure for the illness and our protection still depends on vaccination. Vaccination is recommended in infancy, before the age of two years, preferably in the second year, and provides a basal immunity which should be reinforced between the age of eight and twelve years. Vaccination is free of charge as regards infants and children of compulsory school age, and can be arranged through the family doctor or at the nearest Child Welfare Centre. The following table shows the numbers of vaccinations during 1964. Age Number Vaccinated Number Re-Vaccinated. 0-3 Months 5 - 3-6 Months 10 - 6-9 Months 17 - 9-12 Months 28 - 1 Year 583 - 2-4 Years 42 6 5-14 Years 7 16 15 Years and Over 9 9 Totals 701 31 Puerperal Pyrexia Five cases were notified in 1964, compared with eight in 1963. Puerperal Pyrexia is 'any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage'. 47 Tetanus Tetanus Immunisation is free of charge, as for Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation, for children under sixteen. Immunisation can be given separately, but in infants is preferably combined with immunisation against Diphtheria and Whooping Cough. Reinforcing doses are required at fifteen to eighteen months, at school entry and at age eight to ten years. A further dose can then be given instead of anti-tetanus serum following accidents. At present it is routine to inject anti-tetanus serum after wounds to persons not known to be immunised and it is now common to give an injection of tetanus toxoid at the same time and follow up with two further doses at monthly intervals to give active immunity and avoid the need for further anti-tetanus serum (which can cause reaction) at some future date. A record of the dates of tetanus injections should always be carried on the person During 1964, one thousand, five hundred and nine children received primary injections, and one thousand, six hundred and thirty five children received reinforcing injections. It is very desirable that all who work in agriculture or in stables should be immunised against Tetanus, as the tetanus bacillus is present in horse manure and manured land Infection enters the body through contaminated wounds and abrasions. Food Poisoning Three cases were notified in 1964, compared with none in 1963. One was in a student at a College out of the District, who travelled about a lot. The other two were young children in a family, with two carriers in addition. All were caused by Salmonella Typhi-murium. The low incidence of food poisoning is most satisfactory. Prevention of infection depends on scrupulous cleanliness in the production, storage, manufacture and distribution of food. The washing of hands after use of the W.C. is the most effective protective measure against intestinal carriers of infection. Early notification of cases of food poisoning is necessary so as to obtain the residue of suspected food for bacteriological examination. No food handler should ever be allowed to return to work without bacteriological clearance. Dysentery There were eleven cases of Dysentery in 1964, compared with thirty eight cases in 1963. All were of the Sonne type. Nine cases occurred in an institution. The remaining two cases were the parents of three children although the three children had had symptoms no organism was recovaed from them. Sonne Dysentery is a highly infectious form of gastro-enteritis. The infection is spread by faecal contamination of hands, objects, and in particular, lavatory seats. Prevention depends on the washing of hands after the use of the W.C. and on the efficient cleansing of communal W.Cs. in schools and public places. It is most desirable that all cases of diarrhoea should be checked bacteriologically, particularly in the case of school children, and is essential in food handlers. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers No case of Typhoid or Paratyphoid Fever was reported. 48 Meningococcal Infection No case was reported. Poliomyelitis The year 1964 was the sixth successive year the Borough has been free from Poliomyelitis. During the year approximately one thousand, three hundred and fifteen persons were vaccinated against Poliomyelitis in the following groups:- (1) Children born in 1964 (2) Children bom in 1963 (3) Children born in 1962 (4) Children born in 1961 (5) Children and young persons born 1943 - 1960 (6) Persons born 1933 - 1942 (7) Other priority groups 321 734 115 31 63 23 28 In cddition, eleven persons received third doses, and nine hundred and seventeen persons received fourth doses during the year. Acute Encephalitis There were no cases in 1964. Pneumonia There were fifty six deaths from Pneumonia in 1964, compared with ninety three in 1963. Eleven cases of Pneumonia were notified in 1964, compared with thirty four in 1963. No cases were of Influenzal Pneumonia. Non-Notifiable Diseases School teachers reported two hundred and thirty eight cases of Mumps, two hundred and twenty three cases of Chicken Pox and nineteen cases of German Measles. School returns are a useful index of the prevalence of non-notifiable diseases and are a basis for consultation with the School Medical Officer.

There were four deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis in 1964, compared with none in 1963 There was no death from non-pulmonary tuberculosis, as a gains one in 1963 The total death rate from tuberculosis was 0.05 per thousand of population, compared with 0.013 in 1963. For England.and Wales the death rate was 0.053 per thousand of population (0.047 per thousand for pulmonary tuberculosis and 0.006 per thousand for nonpuimonary uberculosis). The number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis was twelve, as against fourteen in 1963. Residual foci of infection still persist, particularly among the middle aged and elderly, and intensive search will be necessary to eliminate the disease. The use of B.C.G. vaccine in adolescent children gives a high measure of protection. Four hundred and fifty eight children received injections in 1964, and seventeen children were found to be Mantoux positive The response rate in the thirteen year age group was 73.3 per cent. Five new cases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis were notified in 1964, compared with four in 1963. The Sutton and Cheam Tuberculosis and Chest Care Committee continued their valuable work in providing assistance to both tuberculosis and other chest patients and their families throughout the year. Additional nourishment, clothing, bedding and fuel were provided where necessary, and no needy case goes without help. Grants were made to provide occupational therapy, and holidays were arranged for children, mothers, and convalescent patients. The Chairman is Mrs. F. Smyth, J.P., and the Hon.
