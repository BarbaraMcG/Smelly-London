LONDON: Printed By Fredk. Tarrant & Son, 110, Camberwell Road, S.E. 1896. ANNUAL REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE VESTRY OF BERMONDSEY. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting my Twentieth Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Parish of Bermondsey. It includes the registration year of 1895, or a period of 52 weeks that ended on the 28th day of December last. The general mortality of the year exceeded that of 1894 by 135 deaths, and was also slightly above the average of the last three years. The excess occurred mainly in the first and last quarters of the year, and may be justly attributed to exceptional states of the weather rather than to any increase in those diseases which are most likely to be influenced by sanitary regulations. An increase in the number of deaths from measles was counter-balanced by a corresponding decline in the mortality from whooping cough, and the greater fatality from diarrhœa by a satisfactory decline in that from diphtheria. Influenza prevailed more or less throughout the year and was the cause of 28 deaths. Eight cases of small-pox were notified but there were no deaths from that cause. One case of typhus was reported but on enquiry it appeared to have been a case of typhoid fever. A number of small houses having been removed and several large blocks of artizans' dwellings erected, an estimate of the population on the ordinary basis would probably prove fallacious, and consequently the data furnished at the last census remain our best guide. BIRTHS. The total number of births registered in the Parish was 3,212, being 117 more than in the previous year. In the Leather Market District there were 1,310 births, and in St. James' 1,902. The number of children born in the first quarter of the year was 902 ; in the second quarter 777 ; in the third quarter 778 ; and in the last quarter 775. The annual birth rate per thousand of the estimated population in the Leather Market District was 42.7; in St. James' District 35.5; and for the entire Parish 37.9. The birth rate in London was 30.5, being a low rate, bat slightly exceeding that of the previous year. DEATHS. The deaths from all causes recorded in Bermondsey numbered 1,464, and those of parishioners in outlying institutions 405, making a total of 1,869. In the previous year the total deaths were 1,734, of which 1,305 took place in Bermondsey and 429 in hospitals. The total number of deaths in 1893 was 2,004. In the Leather Market District 567 deaths were registered, and in St. James' 897. In the first and last quarters the mortality exceeded, and in the second and third quarters fell below the mean of the corresponding quarters in the three preceeding years. The death rate, calculated on the deaths which took place in the Parish was 17.3, and on the deaths of parishioners which occurred in hospitals, asylums, and infirmaries outside the parish boundaries, 4.8, making the total death rate 22.1. The death rate in London was 19.8 per thousand of the population. In the previous year it was 17.8. The number of deaths of children under 1 year of age in Bermondsey was 496, and in public institutions 24, making a total of 520. The infantile mortality, or the proportion of deaths of children under 1 year of age per thousand births registered in the parish during the year, was 162. The like rate in London was 166, the average of 10 years being 153. CAUSES OF DEATH. The principal diseases of the zymotic class caused 227 deaths in the parish, and 43 in outlying institutions, making a total of 270, against 279 in the previous year. Including the hospital cases, there were 114 deaths from measles, 29 from diphtheria, 20 from whooping cough, 80 from diarrhœa, and 11 from enteric fever. One death was attributed to chicken-pox. Compared with the previous year there was an increase of 35 deaths from measles and 36 from diarrhœa. There was a decline of 37 deaths from diphtheria, 31 from whooping cough, and 5 from enteric fever. The zymotic death rate in Bermondsey was 3. 18. The same death rate in London was 2.64. Our proportion of children at that period of life in which diseases of this class are most fatal considerably exceeds that of London generally. In the class of septic diseases there were 14 deaths, including 4 of children from congenital syphilis, 3 deaths from erysipelas, and 1 from purpura. One death from anthrax took place in hospital. Rheumatism caused 7 deaths and gout 1. There were 6 deaths from rickets, all in children under 5 years of age. The deaths from cancer were 27 in the parish and 23 in hospitals, making a total of 50, which exceeds that of the previous year by 8. The tubercular order of diseases showed an increased fatality, especially under the forms of tabes mesenterica and general tuberculosis. The total deaths in this division numbered 297 (including hospital cases). They formed 15.8 per cent. of the deaths from all causes. There were 165 deaths from phthisis, 48 from meningitis, 31 from tabes mesenterica, and 48 from less clearly defined forms of tuberculosis. Premature birth was assigned as the cause of 54 deaths of infants, being 7 more than in the previous year. Three children died from conjenital malformations and 85 persons from old age. Diseases of the brain and nervous system, including hospital cases, caused 144 deaths, against 119 in 1894. There were 52 deaths from apoplexy, 17 from paralysis, 44 from convulsions, 20 from various forms of brain disease, and 4 from dementia. Disease of the internal ear caused 2 deaths. Two persons died from chronic alcoholism and 1 from delirium tremens, but, as I have previously stated, these figures fall very far short of representing the fatal results which are due to the intemperate use, or abuse, of alcoholic stimulants. Diseases of the hearts and circulatory organs, including hospital cases, caused 112 deaths, the majority of which occurred in persons above 45 years of age. They formed 5.9 per cent. of the total deaths. From diseases of the respiratory organs, including hospital cases, there were 454 deaths, being 23.3 per cent. of the whole. They comprised 227 deaths from bronchitis, 197 from pneumonia, 9 from croup, 4 from pleurisy, and 17 from various forms of lung disease. To diseases of the stomach and organs of digestion 65 deaths were referred; to those of the liver 23; and to diseases of the kidney and urinary organs 30. Diabetes caused 4 deaths, Addison's disease 4, and ovarian disease 1. Three women died from child-birth. The wasting diseases of children contributed the large number of 113 to our total death roll, against 75 in the previous year, and 97 in 1893. Some of these deaths are no doubt due to an inherited constitutional debility, but a large majority of them unquestionably arise from the improper feeding of infants. The deaths from violent causes have increased. There were 21 deaths from fractures and contusions, 21 from accidental asphyxia, 8 from drowning, and 11 from burns and scalds. There were 10 cases of suicide, being the same number as in the previous year. These cases are much more numerous than in former years. There was 1 case of manslaughter and 3 persons were found dead in the Thames and in the Surrey Canal. Ninety-nine inquests were held, in which 59 deaths were attributed to natural causes and 40 to violence. The number of uncertified deaths was 53, or 2.8 per cent, of the whole. The majority of these were infants. The proportion of inquest cases is less, and that of uncertified deaths is more, than the average in London generally. The deaths of parishioners recorded outside the Parish boundaries took place in 34 different institutions. In the St. Olave's Union's Infirmary, at Rotherhithe, there were 176 of these deaths; in Guy's Hospital 106; in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board 31 ; in the Evelina Hospital 16 ; and in 7 different asylums for lunatics and imbeciles 17; the remainder were distributed among 24 other Institutions. In Bermondsey Workhouse there were 46 deaths. The deaths in public institutions amounted to 24 per cent. of the whole; in London the proportion exceeded 26 per cent. About 1 in every 7 deaths occurred in a Workhouse or Parish Infirmary; 1 in 53 in a Metropolitan Asylum Hospital; 1 in 11 in some other hospital, and 1 in 50 in a public lunatic or imbecile asylum. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. During the year 610 certificates were received, being 207 fewer than in the previous year. Sixteen were duplicates, or cases certified by more than one medical practitioner. In 4 cases the diagnosis was of a doubtful character. Two certificates were withdrawn. The notifications included 313 cases of scarlet fever, 119 of diphtheria, 56 of enteric fever, 1 of typhus, 80 of erysipelas, 8 of small-pox, 4 of puerperal fever, and 7 of membranous croup. The total deaths from these diseases, including hospital cases, were, small-pox 0, scarlet fever 16, diphtheria and membranous croup 29, enteric or typhoid fever 11, typhus 0, and erysipelas 3. I must again express my doubt about many of the cases certified as erysipelas being infectious diseases. SANITARY WORK. The reports from the Chief Sanitary Inspector show that a large amount of work is continually being done. The number of houses and other premises inspected, and consequently of notices and intimations served, is not quite so high as in the previous year, but the number of re-inspections was increased by 1332. The special attention devoted to the reconstruction of drains, and testing their perfect condition has been continued. The number of premises inspected during the year ending Lady-day, 1896 was 6,240; 4,611 notices were issued for the execution of works, and 36 summonses were taken out before police magistrates for non-compliance with the order of the Vestry. Six hundred and thirty-two houses in a dirty and dilapidated condition were cleansed and purified; 520 disinfected ; and 28 closed as unfit for human habitation. One hundred and thirty-four cases of overcrowding were abated, against 71 in the previous year. The number of closets trapped and panned and otherwise repaired was 1,060, and 196 were supplied with water. The defective drains which were reconstructed numbered 929 against 1867 in the previous year. Only 3 old cesspools were discovered against 20 in 1894. Defective roofs and rain shoots were repaired in 533 instances; 61 offensive accumulations, 7 animals and 6 lots of fowls were removed as being a nuisance. Several lots of pork, poultry, fish and fruit were destroyed as being unfit for the food of man. The fines inflicted in these cases amounted to £10 and 15/- costs. Five slaughter-houses and 7 cow-houses were inspected and licensed, and 81 bake-houses inspected and maintained in a sanitary state. Three hundred and twenty-eight persons suffering from infectious diseases were removed to hospitals ; 466 lots of bedding and 9,517 articles were disinfected in the disinfecting chamber provided by the Vestry. Eighty-six post mortem examinations were made in the Vestry's mortuary. A large number of factories and workshops was inspected, and in many instances increased W.C. accommodation provided, and other sanitary improvements carried out. In conclusion I have to express my obligation to my colleagues for the ready and valuable assistance rendered me. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN DIXON, M.D., L.R.C.P., Lond., M.R.C.S., L.S.A., &c. Medical Officer of Health. 33, Jamaica Road, Bermondsey. CAUSES OF DEATH. 1895.

The fines and costs recovered under the Sale of Food and Drugs' Acts are to be paid to the Vestry account. In some of the spirits the adulteration was so small that legal proceedings were not taken, and in others Notices were fixed in bar "All spirits sold here are diluted." From the passing of the Margarine Act up to last year half the fines inflicted went to the Police Receiver and half to the Vestry. Owing to a recent decision in a Superior Court, the judges held the Vestry were entitled to the penalties under the Act. Application was made at the Southwark Police Court for half the penalties which had been paid to the Police Receiver since 1887, with the result that the sum of £90 15s. 6d. has been paid to the Vestry's account, and all future fines inflicted under this important Act will be paid to the Vestry.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, 1 have much pleasure in submitting for your consideration my Annual Statement in regard to Houses Let in Lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, this being the Tenth Annual Report I have been privileged to bring under your notice on the subject. During the year 5 houses were recommended for registration, and 5 were by resolution of the Board placed under the Bye-laws. The 5 houses, recommended for registration contained 24 rooms, and were occupied by 17 families, consisting of 78 persons; 12 rooms were overcrowded and deficient in the prescribed air space to the extent of 11120 cubic feet, showing an average deficiency of air space of 927 cubic feet each. Some of the houses were not overcrowded, but the floors were in such a dirty condition, and the proper cleansing of the houses and W.C.'s so neglected, that the Board decided to place them under the Bye-laws, thus rendering the landlords and lodgers liable to penalties if they failed to keep their houses in a cleanly and wholesome condition. During the year notices have been served for the abatement of overcrowding and cleansing of passages, floors, wash-houses, waterclosets, and the remedying of other sanitary defects. The whole of these houses have a good supply of water direct from the main without the intervention of a cistern. The yards are well paved. At Javen's Buildings, Leroy Street, there were only 8 W.C.'s for the twenty tenements occupied by 98 persons. This the Board considered insufficent, and 12 additional W.C.'s were constructed, being 1 W.C. for each tenement. 138, Bermondsey Street the W.C. accommodation was insufficent, and an additional W .C. was provided. The total number of houses now on the Register is 313. The Registered Houses are in the following Streets: Alexis Street 1 Abbey Street 9 Arnold's Place 1 Albion Place 2 Alice Street 2 Aberdour Street 5 Ambrose Street 3 Anchor Street 1 Bell Court 12 Bermondsey New Road 1 Bermondsey Street 1 Bermondsey Square 1 Bermondsey Wall 2 Brandon Street 1 Camperdown Place 4 Castles Buildings 1 Canal Row 1 Catlin Street 1 Chapel Place 2 Cherry Garden Street 3 Crosby Row 4 Crucifix Lane 1 Druid Street 3 Decima Street 2 East Lane 2 Elim Street 15 Fendall Street 1 Ferrand Street 4 Flockton Street 1 Foxlow Street 15 George's Court 1 The Grange 3 Grange Road 3 Grange Walk 6 Gedling Street 4 George Row 1 Green Walk 1 St. James' Road 1 Javen's Buildings, Leroy Street, 3 blocks, 20 suites of rooms 3 Wood's Place 8 King's Arms Place 1 Leroy Street 13 Lamb Alley 3 Larnaca Street 3 Long Lane 5 Long Walk 1 Lucey Road 1 London Street 10 Lockyer Street 2 Lynton Road 1 Marigold Court 5 Marigold Place 1 Marigold Street 4 Marshalls Place 4 Matilda Place 2 Medley's Place 2 Mellick's Place 7 Millstream Road 1 Minto Street 4 Napoleon Passage 2 Neckinger Street 2 Nelson Street 4 Osborne Buildings 1 Page's Walk 2 Parker's Buildings 9 Pleasant Place 1 Porlock Place 5 Paulin Street 1 Prince's Road 1 Riley Street 1 Rolls Road 1 Rouel Road 1 Russell Place 1 Salisbury Street 19 Salisbury Place 10 Ship and Mermaid Row 2 Snowsfields 3 Spa Road 3 Staple Street 4 Stephenson's Court 2 Tanner Street 2 Turner's Retreat 1 Vauban Street 2 Victoria Place 1 West Lane 5 West Grove 2 Weston Street 5 Wilderness Street 2 Williams Square 1 Wolseley's Buildings (8 8 Blocks) Wells Street 2 Woolf-Street 2 Wild's Rents 1 West Street 1 HENRY THOMAS, Assoc. San. Inst., Chief Sanitary Inspector. FORTNIGHTLY REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. January 21 st, 1895. During the fortnight that ended on the 12th day of January, 158 births and 60 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth rate of 48.5, and an annual rate of mortality of 18.4 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death rate in Loudon was 18.3. In the class of zymotic disease only 1 death was recorded. It was from scarlet fever. Diseases of the tubercular order caused 11 deaths, of which 8 were referred to phthisis. From diseases of the respiratory organs there were 18 deaths, viz. : 12 from bronchitis and 6 from pneumonia. Other causes of death included 2 from old age and 3 from apoplexy. Five inquests were held. These were 2 cases of accidental suffocation in bed (male 3 months, female 1 month). Two deaths were uncertified. The number of deaths of children under 1 year of age was 17, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 17. From January 6th to 19th the infectious cases notified were only 12.

With reference to the letter from the London County Council, dated 21st February, 1895, calling the attention of the Vestry to the fact that from the particulars given in the Report of the Council's Medical Officer of Health, it appears that the number of sanitary inspectors employed in Bermondsey, in proportion to the population, is considerably below the average of London generally, I beg to report : — That so far as Bermondsey is concerned, the Report of the Council's Medical Officer of Health is inaccurate. It is therein stated that the number of inhabitants to each sanitary inspector is 26,170. This is an over-estimate of 5,000 persons for each inspector, or of 20,000 persons above the population ascertained at the last census. It appears to me that no satisfactory conclusion can be based on the report in question, because in its list of sanitary inspectors it includes such persons as a caretaker of a mortuary, a disinfector, a road foreman at 24/- per week, cleansers of streets and markets, persons who devote their whole time to dust-bins, smoke inspectors, temporary assistants, and others whose duties are of a limited and special character. Moreover, assistants of this class are included in some districts, and not in others. Considering that the term "sanitary inspector" should include only persons competent to perform, and actually performing the various duties imposed on such an officer by the Public Health Act, I am not prepared to admit that the number of sanitary inspectors employed in Bermondsey, in proportion to the population is considerably below the average of London generally. If it were so, that would not be a sufficient reason for increasing the number of inspectors unless there were other circumstances rendering such a course advisable. I am of opinion that the present sanitary staff of the Vestry is adequate for all existing requirements of the parish. JOHN DIXON, M.D Medical Officer of Health March 2oth, 1895. April 16th, 1896.
