BARN 57 Urban District Council of Barnes. Annual Report on the Health, Sanitary Conditions, etc., of the URBAN DISTRICT OF BARNES, for the Year 1913. by B. C. Stevens, m.d.. f.r.c.s.e., d.p.h., Medical Officer of Health. Barnes, S.w.: R. W. Simpson & Co., Ltd., Printers, 15 High Street. 1914. Public Health Department, The Council House, Mortlake, S.W. February, 1914. Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report for the Year 1913. During the year under review, the Public Health Committee are to be congratulated on the important advances made in preventive medicine. Their motto has been " Salus populi suprema lex;" and acting up to this they have secured a complete scheme for the treatment of Tuberculosis, including Dispensary Wards and Sanatorium ; they have adopted the Notification of Births Act, and have appointed a Health Visitor, and another assistant in the Health Department. Large re-housing schemes are maturing, and houses actually being built. Several important Street widenings have been undertaken and in some cases finished. Old property has been demolished, or, if capable of repair has been repaired. It is hoped that a Swimming Bath will be erected shortly, and premises acquired for the treatment of school children and for the cleaning of verminous or dirty persons. The population is rapidly increasing, and building is going on apace ; at the same time I should like to see more dwellings for the working classes being built. Two important congresses, dealing with Public Health and Tuberculosis, respectively, have been held this year—one at Exeter, and the other in London—both of which were attended by your Medical Officer of Health. I desire to place on record the care and sympathetic attention the P.H. Committee and the Tuberculosis and Hospital SubCommittees have given to the many suggestions and innovations necessarily brought forward during this important year, and to express satisfaction at the harmonious way in which matters for the common good have prospered, or been settled. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, B. C. STEVENS. The Chairman and Members of the U.D.C. of Barnes. index.

(1) PHYSICAL FEATURES AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT. This district fortunately retains its many charms in the way of river, park, commons, and open fields, and it is at the same time an up-to-date suburban district, while from a public health point of view it would be difficult to find any district more progressive. In the course of this report it will be shown that in certain important works in preventive medicine, this district stands alone in the County of Surrey. The real charms of the district are its river, Richmond Park, Barnes, Sheen and Palewell Commons, and also its close proximity to Kew Gardens and Wimbledon Common, The river runs along the whole northern side of the district. The towing path running from Hammersmith to Kew forms a stretch of four miles. 600 acres of Richmond Park are in the parish of Mortlake. 126 acres of Barnes Common extend on the east of the district. 52 acres of East Sheen Common „ south „ 15 acres of Palewell Common „ south-east ,, The district is situated in the north-western part of the county of Surrey, within the Metropolitan Police and the London Postal Area, bounded on the north by the River Thames, on the south and east by the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, and on the west by the Borough of Richmond. The surface of the ground on the 14 Physical Features. eastern side of the district rises with a gradual slope from the river towards the south, proceeding westwards the slope of the ground gets more marked, till at Vicarage Road the highest level is reached. In addition to the fine and permanent stretch of open spaces, there are many large recreation grounds for polo, golf, football, cricket, tennis, hockey, etc. There is also a large number of country houses with extensive grounds attached. Mention should be made, also, of several market gardens and nurseries. The soil is gravelly over the London Clay, which latter outcrops in the vicinity of Palewell Park. There is a gentle slope up from the river to Richmond Park and Roehampton ; surface water gets away very quickly and the ground soon dries. The district is growing rapidly and many new houses are being erected, but at the same time the rural charms of the place are not disappearing and probably never will. It would be difficult to find any district so near London with more town facilities and more country advantages. The population has increased from 17,900 in 1901 to 33,386 in 1913, i.e., nearly doubled itself. There are no occupations in the district which could adversely influence the public health.* The majority of the male inhabitants are business and city men ; a large brewery employs many men, and several large laundries employ many young women. A large number of men also are employed by the London General Omnibus Company and by the London & South Western Railway, also by contractors and builders. The Hospitals supplying this district are the West London at Hammersmith, the Putney and the Richmond Hospitals. The Poor Law Hospital is *A small Carbon by-product factory and a Rubber factory have been causes of complaint, and this matter has been referred to the Inspector of Factories. The proposed erection of a large Gas works in the neighbourhoood is meeting with a very active and justifiable opposition. 15 Poor Law Relief. the Richmond Infirmary, while for infectious diseases, the Council's Isolation Hospital, containing 50 beds, provides for infectious cases in the district and for Tuberculosis locally and throughout the County. POOR LAW RELIEF DURING 1913. 250 orders were issued for Medical Attendance. 175 ,, „ „ Admission to Workhouse. 42 deaths occurred among Barnes and Mortlake cases in the Workhouse. The average number per week in receipt of out-door relief was 150. The Barnes, Mortlake and East Sheen Philanthropic Society was established with the charitable object of seeking out and relieving cases of distress, and rendering pecuniary assistance where such assistance may promote the future welfare of the recipient. The following table shows how the poor were relieved during 1913:— Expenditure. £ s. d. Monetary Relief 4 8 0 Grocery Tickets 26 19 9 Coal Tickets 25 8 7 Bread Tickets 8 18 6 Meat Tickets 9 13 9 Milk Tickets 2 6 1 Boots 2 7 9 Coke 7 0 0 £87 2 5 This Society is doing good work and deserves to be well supported, for it is well organised and charity is not misplaced, as is often the case where the charity is not well managed. 16 Poor Law Relief.

This may to some extent have been effected by recent legislation on social principles. VACCINATION RETURNS FOR 1913. The following table, supplied through the courtesy of the Clerk to the Guardians, is appended to show the proportion of unvac- Vital Statistics. cinated infants in the district, and to give an idea of what proportion of the population is becoming a prey to an invasion by Smallpox should the disease break out in the district:— Births. Vaccinations. Exemptions. Vacc. not taken. January 57 35 17 — February 56 36 9 — March 55 49 13 l April 66 44 12 — May 69 58 15 — June 59 48 19 — July 62 48 5 l August 62 27 10 — September 57 45 13 2 October 61 55 11 1 November 59 36 17 1 December 55 30 10 — 718 511 151 6 This shows that out of 718 births, 151 were not vaccinated, or 21.3 percent. This is assuming that all the infants would reach one year of age. POPULATION. The population at the census of 1901 was 17,900, and had increased at the census of 1911 to 30,377. The population of the district is now estimated at 33,386, up to June, 1913. The number of inhabited houses at the 1901 census was 3,403, and gave an inhabited house rate of 5.2. The number of inhabited houses in 1913 is 7,949,giving an inhabited house rate of 4.2. The natural increase of population or the excess of the number of nett births over nett deaths for 1913 is 386, 18 Vital Statistics. The area of the district is 2,518 acres, exclusive of that area covered by water. BIRTHS. The nett number of births registered during the year is 736, being an increase of 36 compared with last year, and an increase of 38 on the average for the last 5 years. The birth rate is 22.07 per 1,000 of the estimated population. Last year it was 21.8 per 1,000 of the population. Illegitimacy. Of the 736 births registered, 26 were illegitimate, or 3.5 per cent. The death rate amongst illegitimate children amounts to 116 for every 1,000 born, compared with 84.2 for legitimate infants. The birth rate for England and Wales for 1913 is 23.9. „ ,, London ,, „ is 24.8. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered in the district is 294, but for comparative purposes, certain corrections have to be made. 29 deaths of non-residents have to be deducted, and 85 deaths of residents who have died in other districts have to be added. The nett deaths therefore are 350. There were 82 deaths in Public Institutions serving this district: The Putney Hospital 3 The Royal Hospital, Richmond 3 The Richmond Infirmary 42 The West London Hospital 14 The Isolation Hospital Fevers 2 Tuberculosis 18 19 Vital Statistics. The death rate of residents registered in the district is equal to 8.8 per 1,000 of the population. The amended death rate, including residents who have died outside the district is equal to 10.5 per 1,000 of the population. The death rate for England and Wales for 1913 is 13.4. „ „ London „ „ 14.2. (corrected for age and sex). INFANTILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths in infants is given below, viz., 62. This gives a death rate of 84.2 per 1,000 births. The Notification of Births Act has been adopted, and a Health Visitor has been appointed. This Act is in force in 390 districts, serving a population of 20 millions and has invariably been followed by a decline in the Infantile Mortality. In this district the Act has not been in force long enough to draw any definite conclusions from work done. Death Certification still leaves much to be desired in the way of accuracy and precise nomenclature. Confidential death certificates should be sent to the M.O.H., and not given to the relatives, and then perhaps we should get at the truth of things with regard to death from venereal disease, alcoholism, tuberculosis, cancer,etc. MONTHLY CURVE OF BIRTHS, 1913. DEATHS. Weeks of 1913. 21 22 Vital Statistics. The deaths among infants under one year are given in the following table:— DISEASE. Number. Whooping Cough 1 Measles 2 Bronchitis 6 Pneumonia 9 Diarrhoea and Enteritis 8 Mai-Nutrition and Premature Birth 16 Violent Deaths 3 Syphilis 3 Other Defined Diseases 14 Total 62 Of the 62 deaths under one year, only 13 occurred where poor class property prevails. The infantile death rate for England and Wales for 1913 is 109 per 1,000 births. The infantile death rate for London for 1913 is 104 per 1,000 births. LAST YEAR'S RAINFALL. The rainfall registered at the Old Palace, Richmond, for 1913, was 21.64 inches. The number of days on which rain fell was 162. This compares with 27.81 inches and 183 days in 1912. The wettest month was October, when 3.52 inches of rain was registered, and the driest was June, when there was only .46 inches of rain. 23 Sanitary Circumstances. Rainfall has a direct influence on infantile diarrhoea—the wetter the season, the less the diarrhoea, so that in 1913 we should expect to find a higher infantile mortality than in 1912, and this is the case (84.2 as against 58.5 per 1,000 births).

The water supply is that of the Metropolitan Water Board— the supply is constant and sufficient and of good quality. The best proof of the quality is the fact that Enteric Fever, which is largely a water-borne disease, is practically non-existent in the district. The raw Thames water has to be stored so as to allow of sedimentation and filtration. The Board controls the water supply not only in London, but also over a large extra-metropolitan area, and neither the County Council nor any other Local Authority of the Metropolis has any direct power. Besides the special Act or Acts, the supply is governed by certain sections of the Public Health (London) Act, the Waterworks Clauses Act 1874 and the Metropolis Water Acts 1852 and 24 Sanitary Circumstances. 1871. There are statutory obligations laid upon the Board so as to ensure the delivery of wholesome water, and also provisions against pollution by consumers and others. The Controlling Authority is the Local Government Board, which causes the water supply by the companies to be examined periodically, approves or disapproves of new sources of supply, and enquires into complaints made to it as to the quality or quantity of the water supplied for domestic use. A river wall has been constructed in order to prevent the Thames overflowing its banks between the White Hart Hotel and the Lonsdale Road, affecting chiefly the Terrace, Barnes. This is a most important preventive measure for stopping the flooding of basements of these houses and so indirectly preventing the increase of rheumatism and tuberculosis. Excerpts from the 7th Annual Report to the Metropolitan Water Board, by Dr. A. C. Houston. " Over seven years' work on the London water question has convinced me that to a progressively increasing extent the Water Board are securing the reasonable, if not absolute, ' safety ' of the Metropolitan Water Supply. This opinion will carry the more weight since I have been, and still remain, a somewhat merciless critic of any imperfections in processes of water purification. As a counsel of perfection, I still feel bound to advocate the choice of an initially pure source of water supply ; but my own results and experiments do seem to indicate clearly that the evil effects even of an impure source can be largely, if not entirely, annulled by adequate storage and efficient filtration. It needs to be remembered, however, that the more water that is abstracted from a river for waterworks purposes, the less easy does it become to select water of good quality. It is the more important to consider carefully these matters, because still more critical periods will sometimes occur when the 25 Sanitary Circumstances. rivers are running too low to allow much, if any, water being abstracted for waterworks purposes. During these periods the filters are being fed from storage reservoirs, and are really, as it were, borrowing on capital. The reserves may never be completely exhausted ; but when the river water again becomes available for waterworks purposes it is likely to be specially impure in quality, and besides, it is not possible with depleted reservoirs to purify it rapidly by storage. It follows that during the storm periods following drought, supplementary processes of water purification ought to be adopted if most impure water is to be rendered reasonably pure. A system in which a river water of reasonably good and uniform quality is pumped into a nearly full storage reservoir of adequate capacity at the same rate as water is being abstracted for filtration purposes is in a state of what may be termed ' quality equilibrium.' Any falling off in the quantity or the quality of the river water upsets, in greater or less measure, this equilibrium. Reservoirs and filters possess, it is true, an immense ' reserve of purifying ability,' but it would be a most unwise policy to take too much advantage of this circumstance and abstract river water independently of its quality, or rush impure river water through depleted service reservoirs in the hope that the sand filters would sufficiently remove the impurities. Hence arises the desirability of considering the feasibility of adopting a new factor in the London water question, namely, the occasional employment of supplementary processes of purification. Subject to these qualifications, I consider that the means now adopted, or in process of adoption, for the purification of the Metropolitan water supply are such as to render the water reasonably, if not absolutely, ' safe ' for drinking purposes." 26 Sanitary Circumstances. The only case of Typhoid Fever which occurred in this district during 1913 was one in which the disease was contracted in Kent. NEW ROADS IN 1913. The new roads laid out include Treen Avenue and Gilpin Avenue in East Sheen. WORKING CLASS HOUSES. No workmen's cottages or tenement dwellings have been erected during the year, although a number of flats and small villas at rents from 11/6 to 12/6 per week have been erected. With regard to the number of workmen's dwellings generally, very few, with the exception of those erected by the Council, have been erected during the last few years, and as several workmen's cottages have been closed during the year, there is a demand for workmen's dwellings at the present time, and building operations are now in hand; a contract having been let for 28 new dwellings, of which 12 are in hand. It should be borne in mind that these houses are intended to replace those being demolished under the Malthouse Area Scheme. NEW BUILDINGS IN 1913. One hundred and ninety new buildings were erected, and all new buildings are inspected throughout construction from start to finish, and a record kept of the various points in connection therewith. Until all the requirements have been complied with, the habitation certificate is not issued. Particular attention is paid to the drainage and sanitary appliances generally. Plans approved for:— Dwelling Houses, Flats and Shops 44 Alterations or Additions to Dwellings 29 Number of Dwellings Certified 153 Sanitary Circumstances. 27 In addition to the Surveyor's certificate, a second should be supplied by the Health Authority stating that the house is fit for human habitation. Seeing that so many dirty and squalid houses are due to the neglect of the tenant and not to the landlord, the following section (46) of the Public Health Act 1875 may be applied. It states that "If the Medical Officer of Health or two medical practitioners certify that any house, or part of a house, is so filthy as to endanger health, or that the whitewashing, cleansing or purifying thereof would tend to prevent infectious disease, the sanitary authority may require the owner or occupier to cleanse, etc., and in his default may do what is necessary and recover expenses." In the majority of cases, however, notices have been served on the landlord, e.g., after infectious disease. SEWERS AND DRAINS. The water-carriage system prevails throughout the district, with a separate system for storm water. New sewers have been laid in Treen Avenue, Gilpin Avenue and Fife Road. * REFUSE DESTRUCTOR. The number of loads of house refuse collected during the year amounts to 10,474, and this was all consumed by the destructor. The clinker is to be disposed of by laying down a slab making and pressing plant. 28 Sanitary Circumstances.

Clothing below average 1 „ much below average 2 External eye diseases 3 Defective vision 6 Ear diseases and defective hearing 3 Probably mentally defective 1 Mentally defective 1 Probably tubercular 2 Anæmia 3 Contagious skin diseases 2 Recommended for treatment 12 Of the 236 children examined 6 were excluded from school temporarily. In addition to the work in the schools, 115 children were examined at the "Inspection" Clinic, 26 examined at home, and 141 certificates given with regard to ability or not to attend school. Three schools have been closed for periods of 3 weeks during the year on account of measles and whooping cough. The following non-notifiable infectious diseases have been reported among school children by the teachers during the year:— Measles 191 Whooping cough 94 Chicken pox 15 Mumps 13 Measles "Contacts" 48 Whooping cough "Contacts" 8 Chicken pox "Contacts" 4 CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. This Act permits Local Authorities to provide for cleansing and disinfection of persons infected with vermin. Any person requiring cleansing from vermin may apply to have free use of any bath or apparatus provided for the use of cleansing the person and the clothing of the applicant. 33 School Work. The use of such apparatus, etc., is not to be considered parochial relief—Local Authorities may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants. The need for provision under this Act has become very apparent since School Medical Inspection was started. It should, however' be remembered that cleansing a verminous child, and then sending him home to sleep in a verminous bed, is of no use. There must be a thorough house cleansing at the same time. Under this heading it is interesting to refer to Section 122 of the Children Act, which states that "if the School Medical Officer is of opinion that the person and clothing of any child is verminous or in a foul and filthy condition, notice shall be given to the parent or guardian to cleanse the person and clothing of the child in 24 hours. If this is not done, the child may be removed from the school and properly cleansed in suitable premises." It also states that "should the child get filthy and verminous again, the parent or guardian on conviction will be fined a sum not exceeding 10s." The probabilities are that the child will become verminous again because the home conditions have not been dealt with. With the help of the Health Visitor, who also acts as School Nurse, it is hoped that in future these cases will be more closely followed up and remedied. NOTIFICATIONS OF DIRTY HOMES BY SCHOOL NURSES. Number of Notifications received in 1913 6 Number of Homes visited by staff of Public Health Department 6 Number of Homes disinfected 3 Number of Notices served upon owners in consequence of these visits 0 34 Sanitary Administration. Any other points of interest, e.g., efficiency of methods of dealing with rooms infested with vermin:— A cleansing and disinfecting station apart from that at the Isolation Hospital is required. The teachers have reported the following exclusions for contagious disease during the year:— Ringworm, 8. Pediculosis, 7. Impetigo, 3. CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The number of cases of Infectious Disease notified during the year is shown in Table on page 63. Of the total number of cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria notified, 87 and 64 per cent. respectively, were removed to the Isolation Hospital. The method employed to remove cases of Infectious Disease to a Hospital should be such, that prompt removal is effected. It is thought that the procedure in operation here is all that can be desired. Particulars of cases of Infectious Disease to be removed to the Hospital are either telephoned to the Public Health Department by the Doctor, or the notification sent by hand to the Public Health Department. These particulars are immediately transmitted to the Hospital and a request made to the Depôt for a horse to be sent to the Hospital for the Ambulance. The Porter who accompanies the Ambulance seals up the room till the arrival of the Inspector. After office hours and on Sundays, particulars of cases are sent direct to the Hospital. 35 Sanitary Administration. The Assistant Inspector visits the premises, carries out the disinfection and obtains the following particulars:— Date of attack, School attended, Date of last attendance, Number in family, Number of rooms occupied by family, Occupation of parent, Schools attended by contacts, Milk supply, Existence of library books, Occupations of contacts, if any. Where the occupations of contacts are such that there is a possibility of the infection being carried further, their employers are notified as to the occurrence of infectious disease in the homes. Before returning to work, if they have been excluded by the employer, they are given a certificate signed by the Medical Officer of Health stating that the premises have been disinfected. Contacts of Diphtheria are advised to go to their doctor and have swabs taken from their throats. The medical practitioners have seen the necessity for this, and the examinations have increased from 162 to 188. Clinically there may be nothing in the appearance of the throats to indicate Diphtheria, but the result of swabbing may prove that the contacts are a danger to others. Where cases are kept at home, the Medical Officer of Health has to be satisfied that such persons are effectually isolated so as to prevent the spread of the disease. In such cases, the purveyor of milk is notified of the existence of their being treated at home, and a separate can or bottle is left at the premises for the occupier's sole use. The can or bottle being destroyed after the illness. The Laundry used is also notified of the existence of the case. After the termination of the case, and the premises have been disinfected, the laundry and purveyor of milk are both notified that the premises have been disinfected. 36 Sanitary Administration. In those cases where library books have been used or have been in contact with the patient either directly or indirectly, they are destroyed at the Disinfecting Station and compensation for them paid to the Library by the Council. All bedding and other articles used by a patient are removed in a special van to the Disinfecting Station at the Hospital. The premises are thoroughly inspected by the Assistant Inspector, and, where necessary, notice is served by the Medical Officer of Health to secure the abatement of any nuisances discovered. The old method of Fumigation has been abandoned and practically all disinfection is now done by means of the Formalin Spray. When the work is in progress, frequent visits are made to see that the work necessary is properly carried out. By this system of proper inspection and supervision, should further cases occur, one is assured that everything reasonably asked for has been done to improve the hygienic condition of the premises. The notifiable diseases are:—Small-pox, Cholera, Diphtheria (Membranous Croup), Erysipelas, Scarlet Fever, and the Fevers known as Typhus, Typhoid, Relapsing, Continued and Puerperal; also Tuberculosis—pulmonary and non-pulmonary, Epidemic Poliomyelitis, and Cerebro-spinal Fever. With regard to the last two diseases, these were made notifiable by this Council before the Compulsory Order of the L.G.B. came into force. 37 Sanitary Administration.

BACTERIOLOGY. The following Table shows the results of Bacteriological Examinations carried out at the hospital during 1913. Result. Diphtheria. Typhoid Fever. Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Other Diseases. Totals. Positive 79 1 87 — 167 Negative 109 3 77 — 189 Totals 188 4 164 — 356 These examinations exceed those made in 1912 by nearly 100. With regard to Syphilis and Cancer, a local authority would spend money to great advantage if they would sanction a small expenditure for the purpose of sending specimens of blood and sections of tumour tissue to a clinical laboratory for examination and report, to aid the general practitioner in the early diagnosis of these two virulent diseases. It is problematical how far disinfection does good in controlling infectious diseases like Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, as in both cases the personal or human factor seems to predominate over the material factor. This is shown by the number of cases occurring in members of the same family during 1913 in spite of the disinfection of the whole of the premises, clothing and bedding. I have no doubt that Scarlet Fever "carriers" are just as prevalent as Diphtheria "carriers," and that in the majority of cases the patients are those suffering from enlarged tonsils, or who have adenoids or an excess of adenoid tissue in the nose and throat. MILK. So long as the British public is content to drink the fourpenny opaque substance called milk, so long will sophistication and adulteration of that important article of food go on. When the Sanitary Administration. 39 Milk and Dairies Bill of 1912 becomes law, some amelioration of the conditions under which milk is produced may be obtained; but the question of getting the genuine article and bacteriologically pure could only be settled by having a certified milk supply, which means that the cows, premises, workmen, farms, utensils, etc., must be certified as above suspicion in cleanliness and appointment, and that the milk, in addition to being chemically pure, be of a fixed standard of bacteriological purity. This certificate would only be given by a Government Department such as the Board of Agriculture. Milk of this quality would cost about 8d. a quart instead of 4d. The milk supply will not be pure until it can be sent in bottles from the farm to the consumer, so avoiding the contamination by churns and middle men. The Dairy Farmer would have to see that:— (a) The cows are healthy and tuberculin tested. (b) The cows' food is approved by the Station Superintendent. (c) Milk not used during calving period. (d) Employees free from infectious disease. {e) Cows milked only into covered pails, and only utensils used which have been provided by the Central Station. (f) Milk cooled with ice. What the Milk Station does:— (a) Furnishes pure water supply. (b) Furnishes superintendent trained in sanitary science and a force of employees for milk handling. (c) Furnishes separate rooms for receiving milk, washing and sterilising utensils, cooling and bottling of milk, etc. (d) Furnishes steam boiler, power plant, apparatus and machinery for washing, sterilising, bottling, cooling, and equipment for shipment of milk. (e) Furnishes laboratory for bacteriological and chemical testing of samples taken from all dairy farmers daily. 40 Sanitary Administration. The "Toning of Milk" is a commonly practised refinement of adulteration, and consists in adding water or skimmed milk to milk which is above the required standard laid down by the Board of Agriculture, viz.: 3 per cent, of fat and 8.5 per cent, of solids not fat. Supposing for example a sample of milk is found to contain 4 or 5 per cent, of fat, it is watered down until it becomes 3 per cent., much to the profit of the vendor and much to the loss of the purchaser. There are no cowsheds in the district and all the milk is imported. Small general dealers are being discouraged to continue the sale of milk. The following table gives the number of shops and number of visits made during 1913. No. No. of Visits. Dairies and Milk Shops 33 Quarterly. OFFENSIVE TRADES.

HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING ACT. The following work has been done under this Act during the year, and 1,840 houses have been inspected.

Of the houses inspected some 69 were specially scheduled as requiring particular attention. Some of them have since been closed and others put in a state of repair. 43 Sanitary Administration. During the year the expediency of getting extensive repairs done after a conference with the landlord has been tried—this has not proved altogether satisfactory, as there is a tendency to shirk the carrying out in full of the specifications submitted, unless daily and close attention is given by the Inspector, and tenants are often admitted before the workmen are away, thus putting the former to a good deal of inconvenience. In future the Closing Order will be asked for straight away, and this order will be determined when the house has been put in a fit state for human habitation. The work of reparation has been for the most part supervised by the Assistant Inspector whose practical knowledge of building and plumbing has been of much service in this branch of the work of the Health Department.

The Hospital is situated upon four acres of land, adjoining South Worple Way, Mortlake. The buildings consist of an administrative block, three ward blocks, discharge block, mortuary, laundry and disinfecting station, porter's lodge and several shelters for open air treatment. There is also a small building of galvanized iron and wood for the sleeping accommodation of nurses on night duty. The Hospital contains 50 beds for cases of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever and Pulmonary Tuberculosis. The Resident Staff consists of The Matron, 2 Sisters, 1 Staff Nurse, 6 Probationers, 3 Ward Maids, 1 Laundress, 1 Laundry Maid, 1 Cook, 1 Kitchen Maid, 1 House Maid, 1 Lodge Keeper (Porter and Wife), The Porter is also Mortuary Keeper. Outdoor Staff: 1 Gardener. Lectures are given to the Probationers by the Matron and Medical Superintendent. Certificates of proficiency are given at the end of 2 years' training, providing the theoretical and practical work has been satisfactory. During 1913, the number of infectious cases admitted into Hospital was 126. There have been 3 deaths: 2 from Diphtheria and 1 from Typhoid Fever. There were no deaths from Scarlet Fever. 46 Hospital Administration. In addition to the 126 cases mentioned, 78 Tuberculosis cases were admitted. Of the 78 cases of Tuberculosis admitted, 18 died. The Hospital mortality rate for all cases is 9 8 per cent. DIPHTHERIA & SCARLET FEVER CASES ADMITTED. DISEASE. No. Deaths. Percentage.

That is what is generally found. RETURN CASES. There were three "return" cases during the year. In two cases this was attributed to the patient developing a nasal catarrh after leaving the hospital. The precautions taken to prevent infection being taken home are very stringent. They include three weeks' isolation in the acute ward, two or three weeks in the clean convalescent ward, and one day in a clean side ward, with complete change of bedding and clothing before leaving. ENTERIC FEVER. One case only during the year was removed to the Hospital There was only one case notified during 1913. This case contracted the disease in Kent and brought it to Mortlake. The illness terminated fatally, and was complicated by ventral hernia and obesity. 48 Hospital Administration. COMPLICATIONS IN SCARLET FEVER CASES.

Many of the children were found to have large tonsils and adenoids, a great predisposing factor in infection by Scarlet Fever. Many of these children act as "carriers." One of the cases included a Nurse at the Hospital. DIPHTHERIA. There were 43 cases admitted during the year. The average duration of stay was 26 days.

This Table shows that 95 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during 1913, and of these 82 were admitted to the Isolation Hospital or nearly 87 per cent. It will be noticed that in 12 weeks of the year there were no notifications received. There were no deaths in Hospital from this disease. Pour cases give a history of having contracted the disease outside the district. * Attention is called to the diminution in the number of cases notified during School holidays, which goes to prove that Schools may be centres of infection by personal contact and School dust. 50 DIPHTHERIA. * Weeks of 1913. This Table shows that there were 67 cases of Diphtheria notified during the year, and of these 43 were admitted to the Isolation Hospital, or over 64 per cent. Of these 2 died, but the majority of the cases were of a very mild type. In 19 weeks of the year no notifications came in. No cases of Diphtheria could be definitely traced to contagion being contracted outside the district. 51 Hospital Administration. 5i Age and Sex Distribution of Diphtheria Cases.

THE TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. The Local Authority has suitable accommodation in the administrative block of its hospital, and this is used for the purpose, though three rooms are the minimum of space practicable. The Dispensary is open on two days a week at times so arranged as to suit working people and shop assistants. The Dispensary, properly conducted, is perhaps the most important link in the chain of Tuberculosis administration. It is here that the patient is often seen for the first time, and it is from here that his future mode of life must be determined. Patients are given cod-liver oil with or without malt and such palliative remedies as cough linctus, throat lozenges and antiseptic inhalations, also simply worded or pictorial leaflets to study carefully at home. Patients are advised to keep as quiet as possible for 24 hours after 52 Hospital Administration. the injection of Tuberculin, and for this reason Saturday is the best day to give it as a rule. The patients are provided with a thermometer and taught how to use it under the tongue and not in the axilla, and they are given cards on which to record their temperature. The temperature should also be taken mid-day, but this is not always practicable. A register is kept at the Dispensary of all patients attending, and if the treatment is to be continued a proper record sheet is made out for each, with clinical and temperature charts attached. In connection with the Dispensary there is a bacteriological laboratory where sputum can be stained and examined, urine tested, &c. In the grounds of the Isolation Hospital a permanent Dispensary building will be built, with the approach to it leading from a thoroughfare. A Dispensary, containing waiting room, consulting room, dressing rooms and lavatories, should not cost more than £200, and its equipment not more than another £50, since much of what is in the temporary premises can be used again.

There is accommodation for 9 patients in shelters and 16 in the wards. The best shelters are those built to hold 3 or 5 beds and resting on a concrete foundation. The single shelter supplied on the ground of economy greatly increases the administrative work, it is not roomy enough, and the cheaper forms look too much like rabbithutches. A folding camp-bed answers the purpose very well provided it is strong, and for this reason should have three sets of cross legs, two only not proving of sufficient stability. The crude shelter is painted inside with two coats of a cheerful coloured paint, and the floor covered accurately with a piece of the best thick linoleum. It is raised off the ground by blocks of wood or bricks. All shelters have an electric light, an electric bell and a plug for an electric radiator in cold weather. The best shelter 1 know of is a revolving one, which mechanically adjusts itself to any change in the wind so that the back is always to the weather and the open front is protected. It costs £20, whereas the hutch shelter can be got for about £4 *In addition to the 64 regular attenders, 34 "contacts" were examined, and 40 others came up once or twice for an opinion and advice. 54 Hospital Administration. The class of patients who use the shelters are those whose resistance is still good and where there is a reasonable hope for improvement. The 3 or 5 bed shelter does all that a costly sanatorium can do providing the medical supervision and nursing are adequate. Patients sleeping in shelters always use blankets, never sheets. Makers of the larger shelters do not supply guttering and down-spouts for the rain, it is not considered necessary; but practical experience shows that it is most necessary, as the rain dripping off the roof on to the concrete foundation splashes into the shelter. THE HYGIENIC TREATMENT. Treatment on these lines is practically the only one for pulmonary cases of tuberculosis. The three cardinal points are, abundance of fresh air, abundance of good nourishing food, and extra rest, the latter being varied by graduated exercise. Exercise should take the form of walking, light gardening and light games. The other side of the hygienic treatment is the hygienic education of the patient, including the destruction or disinfection of his expectoration, regular baths, cleansing of hands and teeth, and the use of paper handkerchiefs when coughing. Consumptives with moustaches have them clipped short or are clean shaved. The only hope for the future usefulness of domiciliary treatment is the thorough inculcation of these hygienic principles into patients, during their stay in such an institution for the treatment of Tuberculosis. WARDS. A ward to held 8 male and 8 female beds has been equipped, and there are no practical drawbacks to opening up a spare ward in an Isolation Hospital's grounds for the treatment of Tuberculosis, provided certain simple rules are carried out. In many districts now, Typhoid Fever is most rare, and if such a ward has 55 Hospital Administration. been provided by the Local Authority it may with economy be used for the treatment of advanced cases of Consumption. A Typhoid ward originally planned for 5 beds will take 8 consumptives, and one planned for 3 beds will take 5 consumptives. The amount of floor space required for each consumptive bed being 64 square feet. Anything in the way of window blinds or wall decorations should be cleared out and the wards heated by an open fire in addition to gas or hot water radiators. The ward is supervised by the Matron, the patients are in charge of a sister with Tuberculosis experience and assisted by 2 probationers and ward maid according to the number of patients A staff nurse takes the night work. All patients have a metal sputum cup and use paper handkerchiefs; they wash their hands in disinfectant and brush their teeth, and keep their thermometers in a disinfectant solution. The wards are well lighted and flooded with fresh air night and day. Two side wards are available for patients "in extremis." The usual hospital bed-card with history sheet and temperature chart hangs over each bed. A useful classification which should head each bed card is whether the patient is resting or ambulant, and whether febrile or afebrile; so we get 4 classes:—(a) resting febrile, (b) resting afebrile, (c) ambulant febrile, (d) ambulant afebrile (and sometimes a mixed class). In the grounds of the Isolation Hospital a permanent Tuberculosis block will be built containing say, 12 beds with a kitchen, nurses' room and small special ward, for about £70 a bed. A verandah will be provided and if possible a balcony or roof garden. A large common room will be arranged for meals and the 56 Hospital Administration. place warmed throughout by gas or hot water radiators in addition to open fires. In-Patients during 1913.

It is very undesirable to let the ambulant cases feel that their liberty is curtailed. They are allowed out of bounds daily for walks, but are prohibited from visiting shops and public houses; and a barber visits the hospital twice a week. They are provided with pocket flasks for their expectoration, and asked to go into the parks and commons. In the hospital grounds the patients who are well enough do gardening, and play croquet, etc.; while in inclement weather they amuse themselves with cards, dominoes,gramophones, papers, books, etc. A service is held on Sunday evenings and the attendance is not compulsory, but is general and the service is 57 Hospital Administration. appreciated. The officiating Clergy are supplied with the necessary robes which are kept expressly for this purpose. THE AFTERCARE OF THE CONSUMPTIVE. Many cases who have considerably improved but are by no means free of disease ask to be discharged at the end of a few months, in order to work again. Of course there is no power to detain such cases, and the problem is a serious and difficult one. Some uniform standard should be arrived at before discharging a patient as fit for work, at least three out of four of the following conditions should be satisfied, viz.:— (a) No rise of temperature above 99 degrees F. (b) No expectoration. (c) No moist sounds heard in the lungs. (d) Patient gaining weight. When a patient leaves the Institution the Superintendent informs the Tuberculosis Officer for the district in which the patient lives, and gets him properly followed up. Every Health Authority should apply for and get power to detain or isolate every case of consumption who has neither the means nor the facilities for getting proper preventive treatment. STATE AID FOR DISCHARGED PATIENTS. It is often impossible for a patient who has consumption to get suitable employment. His employer often refuses to take him back, and in any case sedentary or dusty work is injurious to his prospects of keeping fairly well. Would it not be possible for each county to have its colony where such patients could be employed in agriculture, farming, building, land cultivation and afforestation, and could not such a colony be practically self-supporting? 58 Hospital Administration.

The total is 74 and it is interesting to note that, approximately, 55 of these obtained treatment at the Barnes Dispensary. Local Tuberculosis Cases attending other Hospitals: — West London Hospital 4 These 22 cases of Tuberculosis attended Institutions outside the district, but eventually 6 of them were treated in our Dispensary or Hospital.

Weeks of 1913. This Table shows that 74 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified during 1913. 55 residents were treated at the Dispensary during the year, some of whom had been notified before last year. 20 residents were also treated as in-patients, some of whom had been previously notified. 22 patients at some time during their illness were treated at Institutions outside the district. There were 33 deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis among Residents in 1913. 6o Sanitary Administration. CEREBROSPINAL FEVER AND POLIO-MYELITIS. Two cases of polio-myelitis occurred during the year :— Female 3 years, removed to Charing Cross Hospital, notified 3/9/13 Male 6½ ,, ,, West London Hospital, ,, 23/9/13 The first case had a febrile illness with loss of power in the lower limbs. The second case was badly paralysed and will probably never recover. UNSOUND FOOD. During the year one consignment of haddocks was submitted to me by a fishmonger for condemnation. All places where food is sold either in the prepared or raw state have been systematically inspected. No tuberculous carcases have been discovered, as the majority of the butchers purchase their stock direct from the London markets. It would be advantageous if each Inspector had power of inspection under the Towns Improvement Clauses Act of 1847. It is also desirable that each Inspector should have a meat inspection certificate.
