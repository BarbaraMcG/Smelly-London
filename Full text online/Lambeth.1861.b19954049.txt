METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. 18th & 19th Victoria, Cap 120 The Vestry of the parish St. Mary, Lambeth. SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT. In accordance with the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act," the Vestry have to Report their proceedings under such Act, and of the Works completed during the year, ending the 25th day of March, 1862. During the year various Works have been executed, Improvements effected, and Public Lighting increased, in relation to which the Vestry have been actuated and governed by the same desire as that expressed in the Reports of previous years, namely, to extend the benefits thereof over the whole Parish, and to render any serious increase of local taxation unnecessary. The Works and Improvements referred to are hereafter specifically described under the respective heads of Sewerage, and Street and House Drainage Works, &c., at page 4; Sanitary Matters at page 6; Highways, New Works, and Improvements at page 14; and Lighting Matters at page 16, The Report also contains an Account in Abstract, showing the Receipt and Expenditure of the Vestry for the year at Lady-Day last; and also a Summary Statement of all Contracts entered into, and of monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by the Vestry. These Accounts have been 4 duly audited and allowed, by the Auditors elected by the Parishioners. For the purpose of efficient publication, an Abstract Account of amounts received and paid by the Lambeth Burial Board from the 25th day of March, 1861, to 21th day of March, 1862, is set forth at pages 36 and 37. The Accounts of the said Board have been duly audited, as evidenced by the certificate appended thereto. SEWERAGE, HOUSE DRAINAGE WORKS, &c. The new Sewer works carried out under the direction of Vestry, during the past year are— 740 feet of 12 in. Pipe Sewer in The Grove, Clapham Road. 362 „ „ Love Lane, Stockwell. 300 „ „ Larkhall Lane. 350 „ 9 in. „ Ditto. 600 „ 12 in. „ Clayland's Road. 894 „ 12 in. „ SLade's Estate Brixton. 210 ,, 2 ft. by 2 ft. Tulse Hill, (Brick Sewer in open ditch). The greater part of the cost of these works has been defrayed by private persons, whose convenience or interest has been served by having them done. Plans have been prepared for the drainage to be executed in those parts of the Parish which depend upon the High and Low Level Sewers for an outlet; and upon their completion everything will be ready so as to afford to the districts the benefit of improved drainage as quickly as possible In pursuance of this plan an outlay of about £7000 is ordered by the Vestry to be made upon works to be executed in conjunction with the main lines now constructing by the Metropolitan Board, at Norwood The Repairs and General Works during the past year include the repair and maintenance of Sewers, Drains, and Gullies, and comprise items of the ordinary character. 5 Flushing and Cleansing has been carried on as before, and the Sewers, both covered and open, are in an average state of cleanliness. Complaints of stoppage, flooding, and other defects and annoyances, have been promptly examined and so far as possible remedied, where the duty of doing so has been with the Vestry. The House Drainage has fallen off during the last year, from the circumstances of most houses being drained where old sewers existed, and scarce any new sewers having been constructed. The applications for house drainage are 159 in number and refer to 623 houses. The estimated cost of private work done by these applicants is £6470, all of which has been executed under the personal inspection and supervision of the Officers of the Vestry. New Buildings.—The Vestry have received notices for building 223 new houses, the drainage of which, and the levels of the lowest floors have been considered and approved as directed by the Act. Thirty one applications, made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for leave to bring out and alter frontages, have been referred to the Vestry, and reported upon by them. And the approval of the Metropolitan Board has been given to the formation of fourteen New Streets. r> SANITARY MATTERS. Between March 25th, 1861, and March 25th, 1862, there were 2,249 cases of nuisance brought under the notice of the General Purposes Committee, by the Medical Officer and Inspectors. 1012 of these cases referred to the state of dwelling houses rendered unwholesome by reason of their filthy and dilapidated condition, or their foul cesspools, or their defective drains. The particulars of these, and of the remaining cases, are shown in the accompanying Table, No. I. The general sanitary state of the parish, as indicated by its mortality in the year 1861, is shown in the following Table, No. II., which gives the total number of births, the total number of deaths, the deaths under five years of age, and the deaths in the workhouses, which occurred in the entire parish, and in each of its eight sub-divisions, during the entire year, and during each particular quarter of the year.

The deaths from Typhus were nearly the same; the deaths from Small-pox and Measles very considerably less, and the deaths from Scarlatina, Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea very considerably more than those of last year. The number of deaths from Scarlatina rose gradually throughout the year, until at last the disease became 10 quite epidemic in the two Waterloo Road districts, and in a limited portion of Lower Norwood. Of the eighteen fatal Scarlatina cases that took place during the year in the Norwood district, 14 occurred in the last quarter of the year, and in the special locality before referred to, which was traversed by many objectionable open sewers and drains. But owing to the progress made by the Metropolitan Board of Works in the execution of their main sewerage scheme, the Vestry has since been able to effect a great improvement in the drainage of this sub-district. Whooping Cough was also more than usually prevalent, and somewhat unexpectedly, its greatest fatality was manifested in the second or summer quarter. The fatal Diarrhoea cases took place almost exclusively among children and in the autumn quarter. Though greatly in excess of those for 1860, they were not above the average. 11 Table 1V gives the populations of London, of the South Districts of London, of the Parish of Lambeth, and of each of its eight sub-divisions, according to the Census of 1851, and according to that of 1861, with the rate of increase during the decennial period 1851—61.* It also gives the deathrates of the same districts and divisions, for the year 1861; whence it appears that the death-rate of Lambeth was considerably less than that of the South Districts of London, and than that of the entire Metropolis.

Speaking in round numbers, These rates of increase have been calculated according to the formula— 10.0219 Log. pop. 1851 Log. pop 1861. 12 the death rate of the entire parish was 21¼ per thousand, while that of the South Districts was 22¾, and that of London 23¼. Of the eight ecclesiastical divisions of the parish, the death rates in five were below, and in three were above that of the entire parish; the death rates of the five more healthy districts being as follows;— BRIXTON - - - 15¼ per thousand. Kennington—2nd Part . - 15¾ „ „ Norwood - - - 15¾ „ „ Kennington—1st Part - - -18½ Lambeth Church—1st Part - 21 „ „ While those of the three less healthy districts were as follows:— Waterloo Road—1st Part - 22½ „ „ Waterloo Road—2nd Part - - 27 „ „ Lambeth Church—2nd Part - - 29 ,, „ The high rate of mortality in the Lambeth Church 2nd district is due to the number of deaths occurring in the Workhouse. Of the total 861 deaths in the district, 279, or very nearly one third took place in the Workhouse. In the Annual Report of the Vestry for 1860, some remarks were made upon the results of the Census in Lambeth. Since then, further details have been published, from which the rates of increase in the above Table IV have been calculated out. From this table it appears that the population of every district in the parish has increased between 1851 and 1861, whereas during the previous decennial period the population of the Lambeth Church 1st district actually retrograded. But with the exception of this Lambeth Church 1st district, and of the Norwood district, the rate of increase during the 1851—61 period was less than the rate of increase during the 1841—51 period. In round numbers, the population of the Lambeth Church 1st district increased at the rate of ¾ of a per cent. 13 per annum, while that of the Norwood district increased at the rate of 6½ per cent., per annum ; whereby the number of its inhabitants has become almost doubled during the ten years, or has increased from 3,977 in 1851, to 7,462 in 1861. The two districts in which the rate of increase has decreased most strikingly are the 1st Kennington, and the 2nd Waterloo Road districts. In the 1841—51 period the population of the 1st Kennington district increased at the rate of more than 3½ per cent per annum, whilst in the 1851—61 period, it increased at the rate of only ¾ of a per cent. per annum. The population of the Waterloo Road 2nd district, which amounted to 18,340 persons in 1851, had only increased to 18,640 in 1861; or at the rate of 3/20ths of a per cent. per annum, instead of at the rate of 12/20 of a per cent. per annum, as in the 1841—51 period. Altogether in the 1851—61 period, as in the 1841—51 period, the rate of increase in the population of Lambeth was less than that of London, and considerably less than that of the southern districts of London. Nevertheless Lambeth continues to hold, as regards its population, a very important position among metropolitan districts and parishes. With the exception of Kensington, which has 7,473 acres, and 186,000 inhabitants, it is not exceeded by any metropolitan district or parish in the two items of extent and population. Its 162,000 inhabitants are spread over an area 4,015 acres, being at the rate of 40 persons to an acre; whereas in Kensington there are only 25 persons to an acre. 14 REPAIRS TO HIGHWAYS, NEW WORKS, AND IMPROVEMENTS. General Repairs have been carried out to a much greater extent than ordinary along the main lines of roads, particularly in the Belvedere Road, Commercial Road, Waterloo Road, Westminster Bridge Road, Mount Street, Vauxhall Read, from the Orphan Asylum to the "Horns," Upper Kennington Lane, Prince's Street and High Street, and the whole of the Roads and Streets under the charge of the Vestry have been from time to time repaired by the staff employed, and with the materials best suited to their several circumstances and localities. Watering and Cleansing have been carried out as heretofore, by Contract, and by the introduction of new and more stringent regulations and terms in the Agreements, these works are better carried out by the Contractors, as cases of neglect are punished by fines. In Angell Town a new well has been sunk, to provide for watering the roads, lately taken to by the Vestry. In Wiltshire Road a new well has been sunk, in lieu of the one in Loughborough Road, which was rained by the main sewer. In Cold Harbour Lane, the same cause necessitated sinking the well by Lilford Road. The wells in the Oval, Windmill Street, Dutton Street, and Hercules Buddings, have also been examined, cleaned out and deepened, so as to give sufficient supply of water. 15 NEW WORKS AND IMPROVEMENTS. The following Works have been carried out during the past year, upon the recommendation of the Committee, being approved by Vestry. Henry Street, Kennington Lane.—Paving repaired and made good; kerb reset and footway gravelled. Melbourne Square.—New kerb, footways, and carriage-way thoroughly made up and formed. and faced with fine and rough gravel. Horace Street.—New kerb, footway, and carriageway made up, formed, and faced with gravel. Somers' Road.—New kerb, foot, and carriage-way made-up, formed, and faced with gravel. St. Oswald's Place.—New kerb, foot and carriage- way made-up, formed, and faced with gravel. Clapham and Brixton Roads.—New 3 in. York paving upon both sides of these roads, comprising a length of about 5 1/3 miles. New Roads.—During the past year the following additional roads have devolved upon the Vestry to maintain and repair— Melbourne Square Horace Street Willington Street Somers' Road St. Oswald's Place. New Lines of Railway.—The Charing Cross, and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway works have progressed without any incident worth referring to—and the Acts for extension, &c., granted last Session, had special clauses inserted, for the protection of public interest. The Street Tramway, constructed by Mr. Train, from "The Horns" to Westminster Bridge, has been removed. 16 LIGHTING. During the past year 38 memorials have been received for improved lighting in various parts of the parish, 22 of which were acceded to, by the erection of new lamps or removals, and 16 refused. There have been 18 new lamps erected, 1 discontinued, and 4 transferred to the Wandsworth Board of Works, while 47 lamps have been removed for purposes of improvement. The total number of street lamps lighted by the Vestry at the present time is 2239, and the cost of lighting, including the removal of lamps, and new columns, for the year ending the 25th day of March last, amounted to £10,421 10s. 5d. Since the publication of last year's Report, the South Metropolitan Gas Company have reduced their charge for lighting the public lamps, south of Brixton Church, from £4 15s. to £4 10s. per annum; with this exception, the price paid for lighting the public lamps continues the same as last year. The Vestry continue to employ a Chemical Examiner of the Gas supplied to the Parish, and he presents a monthly Report to the Lighting Committee as to its illuminating power and purity, which has been found equal to the standard specified by the Metropolitan Gas Act, 1860. During the past year, the Act of 1859, for regulating the measures used in the sale of Gas has been brought into operation, and Inspectors of Meters have been appointed by Metropolitan Board of Works to carry such Act into effect. 17 IN RE HAYLES' CHARITY. Robert Hatles, by his will, dated 1671, gave certain property to Trustees for the benefit of the parish of Lambeth. In 1848 a dispute arose, as to whom the right of appointing the Trustees to the Charity belonged, and in 1851 a scheme was approved and settled by the Attorney-General, whereby it was decreed, that whenever a vacancy in the office of Trustee arose it should be filled up by electing at a meeting of the Parishioners and duly rated inhabitants of Lambeth, in Vestry assembled. In 1855, the Metropolis Local Management Act was passed, under the provisions of which (in conjunction with the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act) the constitution of the Vestry of Lambeth was completely altered, and made to consist of 120 Occupiers of houses of the Rent of £40 per annum, elected by the Parishioners. Under these circumstances, the Question had again arisen as to whom the right of appointing the Trustees of the Hayles' Charity belonged, whether to the Parishioners and Inhabitants as defined by the Scheme, or to the Vestry, under the Statutes above referred to. In order to determine this important Question, the Trustees of the Estate directed their Solicitor, Mr. R C. Barton, to present a petition to the Master of the Rolls. The Clerk of the Vestry, as authorised, instructed Counsel to appear on the hearing of such Petition, on behalf of the Vestry, and also on behalf of Mr. Samuel Gibbins, who with Mr. Charles Brookes Teague, were elected by the Vestry, as Trustees of the said Estate. 18 The Petition was heard before the Master of the Rolls on the 29th day of April last, and on the 12th day of May 1862, his Honour pronounced judgment; that the Statutes controlled the Scheme, and the Vestry, as at present constituted, had the power of appointing the Trustees. The Order made on the Petition is to the effect following; that Samuel Gibbins and Charles Brookes Teague have been duly elected Trustees of Hayles' Estate, and that the right or power to elect new Trustees of Hayles' Estate in the place of Trustees of said Estate who may have resigned, or become incapable of acting as Trustees, or who may have died, or become disqualified, is vested in the Vestry of the parish of Lambeth, in the County of Surrey; elected in pursuance of the 18th and 19th Vic., Cap. 129; and the 19th and 20th Vic., Cap. 112, or either of the said Acts.
