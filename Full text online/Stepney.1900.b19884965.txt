Gentlemen— I beg to present to you my Annual Report of the Health of Mile End Old Town for the year 1900, and in doing so I must claim your indulgence for so short a report, as my health has been indifferent for some time past and am now far from well.

From the table compiled by the Inspectors it will be seen that a large amount of very useful work has been accomplished, and knowing the various details of the work, I can honestly say that the Inspectors, all three of them, have taken the keenest interest in their work, and the three districts (into which the Hamlet is divided for sanitary purposes) will be found to compare more than favourably with any in London. Unsound Food. During the year a number of seizures of unsound food have been made, consisting of tinned goods in each case. It had come to our knowledge that a certain dealer in manure had been allowed to remove tinned foods as refuse from certain wholesale dealers, and strong suspicion was entertained that some of the tins were finding their way elsewhere than to the rubbish heap. On April 23rd a cart belonging to the manure dealer in question was observed and followed to a jam factory at No. 12, Old Church Road, in the occupation of Messrs. White and Bayer. Your Inspector, Mr. Twaits, after allowing a short time to elapse, made an unexpected visit to the factory, and there found blown tins of fruit being manufactured into " pure home made jam." He was enabled to seize a large quantity, which were removed and condemned. The next day, accompanied by the Inspector, I visited the premises of the manure dealer, Worsfold, who admitted that Bayer had offered to do the best he could with the stuff. Both Bayer and Worsfold were summoned, each being fined £20 and costs. 17 During the month of June a seizure of tinned milk, sardines, etc., was made at the shop of a Mrs. Dywein, of No. 267, Commercial Road, resulting in a fine of £5 and costs. Shortly after this seizure your Inspector, Mr. Twaits, and myself examined the stock of a shop at No. 35, Old Church Road, where we found more than half the tinned lobster, salmon and sardines in the shop to be unfit for human consumption. The shopkeeper and the dealer who had sold the tins were summoned, with the result that a fine of £5 was inflicted in each case, with the alternative of a month's imprisonment. In bringing these offenders to justice much time and trouble was spent, the results reflecting great credit on the Inspector who had the cases in hand. It is with regret that I now take leave of my office, having been for fifteen years in the district, and I am glad to say, without egotism, I leave it in a much better condition than I found it. I have, as some of you know, taken a keen interest in Mile End, and the lasting work which has been accomplished reflects credit on the Sanitary Staff placed under me. They have always worked loyally to better the condition of the district. I can only hope that the work will be continued, and trust that the amalgamation of the four districts will be for the benefit of the inhabitants. I am, Your obedient Servant, THOMAS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. 18 TABLE 5.
