Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Fifteenth Annual Report on the vital statistics and the sanitary condition of the Borough, together with particular returns required by the Local Government Board and Home Office, for the year ending December 31st, 1915. The frequent changes in the temporary staff has caused some difficulty in its preparation, responsible for delay. From the statistical returns it will be seen that Lewisham still remains one of the healthiest of the London Boroughs. The death rate recorded for the year was 12.86 per thousand persons living at all ages, compared with 10.9 in 1914. The increase over the rate in the previous year, is more apparent than real and occurs throughout London by reason of the calculation being made upon the estimated civil population, which estimated figure I think is lower than the actual number residing within the Borough. Notwithstanding this fact, the death rate of 12.86 is the lowest in London except Hampstead, which is 12.3 per thousand. It bears satisfactory comparison with the death rate 16.8, the recorded figure for the County of London. The birth rate again shows a slight fall, being 19.3 per thousand, compared with 19.5 in 1914 and 20.3 in 1913. It is satisfactory to note the low infant mortality rate recorded in the Borough, namely 79 per thousand births, the lowest recorded in London except Hampstead, which has a rate of 78 per thousand births. The rate for the County of London was 112. The recorded death rate from Phthisis is again the 8 lowest in London, 0.9 per thousand persons living at all ages, with the exception of Hampstead which was 0.7. I am pleased to record the satisfactory way in which the public have appreciated the importance of the Notification of Births Act. The notification within thirty-six hours of birth required by the Act was complied with in 3,172 births out of a total of 3,372. Information with regard to the balance followed after written application. With regard to the 258 infant deaths registered in the Borough, it is interesting to examine the table of causes set out on page 24. It shows clearly that even in Lewisham, notwithstanding its comparatively low infant mortality, a large proportion of these deaths were from preventible diseases. Having regard to the heavy losses in this stupendous war, the necessity of taking immediate steps to conserve the child life of every district throughout the country is more pressing than ever it was, and I trust your Council will earnestly consider this important subject at an early date. I have the pleasure of again expressing my cordial appreciation of the unfailing assistance given me by the staff, who notwithstanding the difficulties which have occurred by absence of several members who are serving with the Forces, have most willingly and cheerfully combined to do more than their regular share of duty. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. VITAL STATISTICS. 11 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1915. VITAL STATISTICS. Population.—In previous years it has been the universal custom to adopt the Registrar-General's figure of estimated population to the middle of each year. We have been advised by the Registrar-General that owing to the war it is no longer possible to adhere to former methods of estimation of local and national population based upon census returns. Men of military age have been largely drafted to military training centres or abroad. The remainder of the adult population and to some extent the female population have removed to areas other than those in which they were recorded by the census. The census returns therefore are, under these abnormal conditions, quite unreliable as a factor for calculation. The Registrar-General points out that for the calculation of death rates of a district the civil population is obviously the 12 proper figure to use to give a fair representation of the health of a district, and consequently to exclude from local returns the deaths of all members of the armed forces of this or other countries. On arriving at the estimated civil population of a district, he fortunately had at his disposal figures of the National Register, and after investigation in other channels it would appear that although a certain number of persons may have escaped registration this did not seriously affect the issue, and the estimated civil population assigned to the district, although not perfect, is under the circumstances the nearest approach to a true estimate that can be obtained. We have therefore adopted the figure 164,438 supplied by the Registrar-General as the civil population of the Borough of Lewisham for the year under review, which compared with the population figure calculated upon the former methods of 172,433, shows a migration in round figures of 8,000. The question of the population figure to be used for calculating the Birth Rate has been considered. As the births registered are not only children of civilians, the use of the estimated civilian population would be fallacious, and it has been suggested by the Registrar-General that the Birth Rates for the year 1915 should be calculated upon the existing estimated population of 1914. This we have done. 13 Table shewing the Area and Population of the Borough, in Wards Ward. Area in acres. Enumerated Population Census, April, 1901. Enumerated Population Census, April, 1011.

Twenty-six of this number were born to parents whose usual place of residence was in other districts, and we were advised by the Registrar-General that 49 children were registered in districts outside, the parents of whom were residents of the Borough of Lewisham. The corrected number of births belonging to this Borough is therefore 3,267, the males numbering 1,630, and the females 1,637, which is equivalent to a birth-rate of 19.3 per 1,000 inhabitants. In 1914, 3,306 children were born, which shows in one year a decrease of 39 in the number of births. The birth-rate for the County of London was 22.6 per 1,000, for the 96 Great Towns, 22.8 per 1,000, and for the whole of England and Wales, 21.8 per 1,000. Illegitimacy.—The illegitimate births numbered 86, compared with 89 in 1914. 15 The following table shows the number of births occurring in the various Wards of the Borough, together with the rate per 1000 inhabitants:— Wards Males.

During the year 1915, 3,372 notifications of births were received under the above-named Act. In 200 of these cases the notification was not obtained until after a notice had been sent from this Department to the parent, pointing out the omission. The examination of the notifications above referred to, revealed the fact that in 91 cases the notification received referred to still-births, leaving a total born alive of 3,281. It is satisfactory to note therefore, that the conditions of the Notification of Births Act, have been admirably carried out by the inhabitants of the district. The difference between the number of births registered and the number notifiable being only 14, is accounted for by the varying period allowed—for registration, six weeks and notification thirty-six hours. 16 The following Table shows the number of cases notified, the person by whom notified, whether the children were born alive or dead, and the total number of births registered in the Borough:— Total No. of Births Notified.

The number of Marriages in the Borough during the year was 1,663, compared with 1,195 in 1914, and 1,070 in 1913. Of this number, 902 were solemnized at the Established Church, 181 at Nonconformist Places of Worship, and 580 at the Register Office. MORTALITY.

The average number of deaths in the 10 years, 1905-14, was 1,788. The corrected death rate for the Borough was 12.86 per 1,000 of the population, compared with 10.98 per 1,000 in 1914. 17 The following Table shows the death rates in the various Wards of the Borough during the year under review, and the previous year:— Wards.

The infectious diseases notifiable under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are :—Small-Pox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Erysipelas, the diseases known as Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever, and the Fevers known by any of the following names:—Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Relapsing, Continued or Puerperal; Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, and Acute Polio-Myelitis or PolioEncephalitis. The total number of cases notified during the year 1915 amounted to 900, of which number 632, or 70.22 per cent. were removed for isolation to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals or other Institutions. In 27 instances, or 4.27 per cent. of the cases removed, the Hospital authorities returned the patient as not suffering from any notifiable disease. Deducting these from the gross total, we have a corrected total of 873 cases of infectious disease notified as occurring in the Borough during the year, a decrease of 651 compared with the total for the preceding year, which was 1524. In 1913, 1215 cases were notified. Age Periods.—38.72 per cent. of the Scarlet Fever cases, compared with 40 95 per cent. in 1914, and 36.8 per cent. of the Diphtheria cases, compared with 46.65 per cent. in 1914, occurred among children aged six years and under. The following figures show the percentage of cases occurring among children of the age of six years and under to the total notifications of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria:— Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria.

The attack rate from all infectious diseases (excluding Puerperal Fever and Chicken-pox) during the year amounted to 5.28 per 1,000 of the population, compared with 9.00 in 1914 and 7.02 in 1913. The attack rate for the County of London was 7.69 compared with 9.01 in 1914. The attack rates for the Wards will be found on page 56. It will be seen that Sydenham Ward had the largest number of cases in proportion to its population, having an attack rate of 7.99 per 1,000. The lowest attack rate was in Church Ward, 2.04 per 1,000. 47 Number of Cases of Infectious Diseases notified in the Ten Wards and the Whole Borough during the Year 1915.

Of this number, 376, or 80 per cent., were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals. Subsequently 11 cases were returned to their homes and stated not to be suffering from any notifiable disease. Deducting this number, a corrected total of 470 is obtained, compared with 945 in 1914, equal to an attack rate of 2.85 per 1,000 persons, compared with 5.58 in 1914. The attack rate for the County of London was 3.75 per 1,000. An examination of the attack rates for the various Wards of the Borough shows that the highest occurred in Sydenham Ward (4.79 per 1,000) and that the Ward least affected was Manor Ward, Lee, with 0.86 per 1,000. 45.31 per cent. of the cases occurred among children between the ages of 5 and 10 years, and 18.29 per cent. among children under the age of five.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. † The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of the lists received from those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted.
