It is satisfactory to note that the Infantile Mortality was only 60 per 1,000 births, and was the lowest ever recorded in the Borough. This low mortality was largely due to the low number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis, from which causes there were only 19 deaths of infants, compared with 81 in the previous year. The Infantile Mortality among legitimate infants was 59 per 1,000 legitimate births, and among illegitimate infants 111 per 1,000 illegitimate births, or nearly twice as great.

From all infective diseases the death-rate was 2.28 per 1,000 (2.32 in Clapham, 1.93 in Putney, 2.0 in Streatham, 2.37 in Tooting, and 2.65 in Wandsworth). The rate is slightly higher than in 1921, owing to the increase in the number of deaths from Diphtheria, Measles and Influenza. The rate in 1917 was 2.71; in 1918, 5.37; in 1919, 2.50.; in 1920, 1.96 ; and in 1921, 2.26. The rate from the principal infective diseases, viz.:â€”Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhoea, was .73 per 1,000 (.68 in Clapham, .57 in Putney, .57 in Streatham, .80 in Tooting, and .93 in Wandsworth), compared with .74 in 1916, .94 in 1917, .82 in 1918, .42 in 1919. .61 in 1920, and .70 in 1921. The rate for 1922 is slightly higher than in 1921. The slight increase compared with 1921 is almost wholly due to the increase in the number of deaths from Diphtheria, Measles and Influenza. PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Table XVI. shows the cases of infectious diseases notified during the year. The total number of cases, less Tuberculosis, was 4,018, 748 from Clapham, 307 from Putney, 994 from Streatham, 501 from Tooting, and 1,468 from Wandsworthâ€”compared with 4,918 in 1921. The number appears high, but it includes 1,056 cases of Whooping Cough. Measles and German Measles ceased to be notifiable diseases on 31st December, 1919, and any information as to the incidence of these diseases was obtained chiefly from the London County Council elementary schools.

Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria, and a decrease in all the others. Small-pox. No case of this disease occurred during the year. Scarlet Fever. This disease was not so prevalent during the year, compared with 1921. (9323)q c 2 20 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths was 19, and the death-rate per 1,000 was .05. The case mortality was 1.5 per cent. In all, 1,257 cases were notified, 228 in Clapham, 57 in Putney, 332 in Streatham, 154 in Tooting, and 486 in Wandsworth, compared with 1,978 in 1921. The rate per 1,000 of population was 3.76, 3.70 in Clapham, 1.96 in Putney, 3.12 in Streatham, 3.93 in Tooting, and 4.99 in Wandsworth. 22 cases occurred in institutions in Tooting. Of the total number of cases, viz.â€”1,257â€”1,118, or 88 per cent., were removed to hospital. As will be seen in Table XX, some schools were more affected than others. The Medical Officers of the London County Council made inspections of 15 schools during the year, and any suspected cases were at once excluded and the names forwarded to me for inquiry. The number of dwellings in each sub-district and the whole Borough in which multiple cases occurred is shown in the following Table Table XVIII. Sub-Districts. One case. Two cases. Three cases.

Of the 1,019 houses invaded, multiple cases occurred in 134, or 13.1 per cent. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 21 Diphtheria. This disease was not so prevalent as during the previous year. The number of deaths was 76, and the death-rate per 1,000 was .22. The case mortality was 9.0 per cent. The total number of cases notified was 838, 167 in Clapham, 67 in Putney, 146 in Streatham, 160 in Tooting, and 298 in Wandsworth. The rate per 1,000 of population was 2.5, 2.7 in Clapham, 2.2 in Putney, 2.2 in Streatham, 4.0 in Tooting, and 3.0 in Wandsworth. The number of cases was 171 below the number in 1921, but was 189 above the corrected decennial average. Of the 838 cases, 813, or 97 per cent., were removed to hospital. No difficulty was experienced in having cases promptly removed to hospital. With regard to schools the highest number of cases occurred among children attending Sellincourt Road School, the next Swaffield Road, and the third New Park Road. The following schools were visited by the Medical Officers of the London County Council, and swabs taken from the throats of some of the pupils examined. In Clapham, New Park Road; in Putney, St. Mary's, Charlwood Road; in Tooting, Hillbrook Road and Sellincourt Road; and in Wandsworth, St. Ann's, Swaffield Road and The Wandle. As a result of this swabbing, 13 cases were found to be positive and 13 suspicious. All the cases were swabbed again and not re-admitted to school till found negative. Every positive or suspicious case was visited and all necessary precautions taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The number of dwellings in each sub-district and the whole Borough in which multiple cases occurred is shown in the next Table. 22 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table XIX. Sub-Districts.

Of the 623 houses invaded, multiple cases occurred in 93, or 14.9 per cent. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. Thirty cases of scarlet fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and there were also 17 cases of diphtheria. Ten of the return cases of scarlet fever occurred in Clapham, one in Putney, six in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 11 in Wandsworth. Eight of the return cases of diphtheria occurred in Clapham, one in Putney, one in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth. Enteric Fever. The number of deaths was two, the death-rate was .005 per 1,000, and the case mortality 9.09 per cent. The number of deaths from this disease was lower than in 1921. Twenty-two cases of enteric fever were notified, two from Putney, two from Streatham, and 18 from Wandsworth. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 23 Five of the cases on admission to hospital were found not to be suffering from enteric fever. The number of cases is 10 under that of last year, and 22 below the corrected decennial average. One of the cases was notified as para-typhoid fever, and this case recovered. In two of the cases there was a history of having consumed ice-cream two or three weeks prior to the attack. In one case no history could be ascertained, and the remaining 13 cases were the subject of a special report of which the following is a precis:â€” The first case was notified on the 11th July, and the last on the 7th November. Five of them came from Summerstown and eight from Burmester Road. As a result of enquiries made, it was found that 10 of the cases had been supplied with milk by a registered purveyor in this Borough who obtains his milk from 10 or more farms in the country. Two of these farms adjoin each other at Verwood, Wimborne, Dorsetshire, and in February and March of this year 12 cases of enteric fever were notified in that districtâ€”two of them being at one of the farms. At one of the farms both the farmer and his daughter suffered from the disease. They were taken ill in January, and appear to have been treated at the farm, which was disinfected on 6th April. Previous to that date, three negative tests, made at weekly intervals, had been obtained from each patient. Two and a-half months later, the first case in Wandsworth was taken ill, the ascertained date of onset being the 20th June. If this case was infected through milk from the farm at Verwood, it is likely that a focus of infection continued at the farm after the 6th Aprilâ€”the supposed date of recovery of the farmer and his daughter. There is evidence that this may have occurred, as the farmer is said to suffer from gall stonesâ€”a condition closely associated with the carrier problem in enteric fever. The stools of both the farmer and his daughter were again examined, but proved to be negative. The whole of the milk from the farm is sent to the Wandsworth dairyman, except a small quantity retained for domestic purposes, 24 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. and although he supplies a large number of customers in Wandsworth, the area covered being considerable, yet all the cases occurred in two streets which join Garratt Lane within a few yards of each other. Of the cases supplied by this dairy, five are members of the same family living in the same house ; two are members of the same household ; while two others, boys aged 11 and 12, are friends. In each of these three groups the disease could easily have been spread by direct personal contact. Three of the 13 cases did not obtain their milk from the dairy in question. Two of them are brother and sister, and there is a definite history of one assisting in the household duties of the family where five cases occurred, and she was most probably infected from one of them. In the third case no history of possible contact infection can be obtained. The possibility that infection has been conveyed by other foodstuffs has been investigated, but no evidence that this occurred could be ascertained. In none of the cases was there a history of shell-fish consumption. In seven cases it Was stated that the patients made fairly frequent visits to a fried-fish shop in Summerstown. This shop has been inspected, and the process of frying seen in operation, but no source of infection could be traced. The fish is all gutted, and the frying is carried out thoroughly, while the persons working on the premises were all in good health. In one case it was stated that the patient had eaten watercress from well-known beds in the neighbourhood. In 10 of the cases, the relatives stated that the patients never partook of ice-cream, while in three, some had probably been eaten, but the information on this point was indefinite. With regard to water supply, the house where five cases occurred was supplied by a cistern which was very dirty when inspected. This water was examined bacteriologically, and no bacilli of the enteric group were isolated, though the specimen was much below the standard of London water as regards coliform bacilli. It was stated that all the members of this household drank large quantities of water. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 25 Two cases obtained their water from a cistern which was allowed to run dry once a week. In the remainder, the supply is from the main. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In 26 cases (12 of scarlet fever, seven of diphtheria, five of enteric fever, and two of encephalitis lethargica) information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's and other hospitals that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified, or any other notifiable disease. Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. Three deaths occurred from this disease (one in Putney, one in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth). Six cases of this disease were notified (one in Putney, two in Streatham, one in Tooting, and two in Wandsworth). Five of the cases were removed to hospital. Sixteen deaths were registered as having been caused by meningitis (one in Clapham, one in Putney, six in Streatham, three in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth). Five of these were of infants under one year, four from two and under five years, and seven over five years of age. As in previous years, inquiries were made from the medical attendant, and in all the cases, with the exception of two that died from posterior-basic meningitis, the deaths were stated to have been caused by simple or pneumonococcal meningitis. Encephalitis Lethargica. Two deaths occurred (one in Streatham and one in Tooting). One of the deaths was of a person from 15 and under 25 years, and the other was over 65 years. Six cases were notified (two in Clapham, one in Putney, one in Streatham, one in Tooting, and one in Wandsworth). Two of the notified cases died from tubercular meningitis, two from encephalitis lethargica, and in the other two recovery was more or less complete, although there were slight after effects. 26 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Polio-myelitis and Polio-encephalitis. Four cases were notified during the year and one death resulted. The three surviving cases have recovered without paresis or paralysis. Erysipelas. Three deaths occurred from this disease during the year ; 108 cases were notified (28 in Clapham, seven in Putney, 18 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 47 in Wandsworth). Malaria. Three deaths occurred from malaria; one of these contracted the disease in Mesopotamia, another in India, and the third, a female, in Northern Rhodesia. Thirteen cases were notified (two in Clapham, three in Putney,, four in Streatham, one in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth). All of the cases but two were males. No case was notified in which the disease was contracted within the Borough. Of six Army cases, one contracted the disease in India, one in Gallipoli, one in Mesopotamia, one in N.W. Africa, and two in other parts. One of the two females notified contracted the disease in Salonicar and the other in Northern Rhodesia. Every case notified was visited to ascertain that proper treatment was being given, and any cases where the patients were not having proper medical attention were advised to attend a special hospital. Diarrhoea. Thirty-two deaths, 13 of males, and 19 of females, occurred from all forms of diarrhoea and enteritis during the year. Four of the deaths occurred in Clapham, four in Putney, eight in Streatham, six in Tooting, and 10 in Wandsworth. There was a decided decrease in all the sub-districts compared with 1921. The number of deaths is 89 below the corrected decennial average, and is the lowest ever recorded in the Borough. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 27 The death-rate was .09 per 1,000 (in Clapham .06, in Putney .13, in Streatham .07, in Tooting .14, and in Wandsworth .10), compared with .33 in 1921, .18 in 1920, .17 in 1919, and .32 in 1918. Of the total number of deaths from diarrhoea registered, 19, or 59 per cent., were of infants under one year. The number of deaths from diarrhoea, zymotic enteritis, and enteritis under one year represents 9.4 per cent, of the total mortality at that age. Dysentery. One death occurred during the year. Three cases were notified (one in Clapham and two in Putney). All the cases were males, and in two the disease was contracted during Army service in the following war areas: one in France and one in Salonica. The third case, a child of years, is the son of a man who had been treated for dysentery in a military hospital and discharged as cured. He is stated to still pass blood and slime occasionally. Trench Fever. No case was notified during the year. Measles and German Measles. Seventy-two deaths occurred (16 in Clapham, five in Putney, 16 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 26 in Wandsworth). The death-rate per 1,000 of population was .21, compared with .012 in 1921. The notification of these diseases was discontinued at the end of 1919, but 50 cases were notified by doctors during the year, although the greatest number was reported by the Divisional Officers of the Education Department, or by the teachers of the elementary schools. 28 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. As will be seen from Table XX, 1,613 cases were reported from this source, but the number reported is necessarily much under the number of cases that occurred, as there was no report from the numerous private schools in the Borough, and even from the elementary schools there were no reports during the summer vacation. Cases under five years of age are not reported unless the children are in attendance at school, and this is only the case between four and five years. In all, 1,842 cases were reported, 25 under one year, 472 from one and under five years, 1,340 from five and under 15 years, and five over 15 years. 365 cases occurred in Clapham, 136 in Putney, 375 in Streatham, 237 in Tooting, and 729 in Wandsworth. Twenty-five of the cases were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals on account of insufficient accommodation at home. Except in Wandsworth, there was no epidemic prevalence of this disease during the year, and even in that sub-district the total number of cases was not great. Thirty-seven cases of German measles were also reported (10 in Clapham, one in Putney, 19 in Streatham, four in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth). During the year 1,380 visits were made in cases of these diseases (268 in Clapham, 97 in Putney, 331 in Streatham, 193 in Tooting, and 491 in Wandsworth). The total number of premises disinfected was 1,001 (179 in Clapham, 89 in Putney, 199 in Streatham, 164 in Tooting, and 370 in Wandsworth).

In Table XXVI it will be seen that since 1909, 8,481 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis have been reported. With regard to the notifications of cases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis, in all 145 cases were notified (22 from Clapham, nine from Putney, 36 from Streatham, 20 from Tooting, and 56 from Wandsworth). Table XXVII shows the number of these cases notified classified according to the part of the body affected, as well as the number of deaths in each class. It will be seen from this Table that by far the most fatal form of tuberculosis is tuberculosis of the brain, of which 28 cases were notified and 26 died. Table XXVII. Localisation of Disease.

In addition to these visits by the Health Visitor, 3,658 visits were made by the Dispensary Nurses, these visits being made by the instruction of the Tuberculosis Officer to cases under his care at the Dispensary. During the year 20 sputum flasks have been supplied, and in eight of the cases visited the patients already had one. During the year disinfection was carried out at 303 premises either after the death or removal of the patient; 54 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, 24 in Putney, 90 in Streatham, 37 in Tooting, and 98 in Wandsworth. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARIES. There have been no changes in the Staff of the Dispensaries during the year. Institutional Treatment.â€”The responsibility for Institutional Treatment of all persons now rests with the London County Council. Under this arrangement, all applications for treatment in residential institutions are made to the County Medical Officer of Health, whether the person is insured or not, and uniformity of procedure has resulted. The arrangements include the provision of observation beds for cases of difficulty, where special investigations are required in order to arrive at a correct diagnosis. These beds have proved of considerable help in dealing with cases of this nature. Co-operation with other Institutions.â€”Cases requiring special investigation which can be carried out without admission to Hospital are still referred to St. Thomas's Hospital under the scheme in force since 1913. As shown in Table XXXI., a smaller number of cases has been referred to the Hospital under this arrangement than the previous year, due to the fact that it has not been found necessary to send so many cases to that Hospital for examination. The reports forwarded have been of great value. The scheme has been extended to include the treatment of lupus by Finsen Light or X-rays. Arrangements have also been made with the Hospital for Consumption, Brompton, for supplying refills to patients who have been treated by the artificial pneumothorax method. 46 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Dental Treatment.â€”The agreement with the British Dentists' Hospital for providing dental treatment, including the provision of dentures, has been in force throughout the year. Forty-five patients received dental treatment and 20 of them were supplied with dentures. The attendances at the dentist totalled 148. Extra Nourishment.â€”On June 22nd, 1921, the Council decided to supply extra nourishment to persons suffering from tuberculosis, under Section 3 of the Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act, 1913. The maximum amount which can be spent in any one year is Â£2 per 1,000 population, i.e., Â£650 for the Borough. The scheme was approved by the Ministry of Health and has been in operation during the year. It provides that the nourishment be granted on medical grounds only, and be considered as part of treatment. It is limited to the slighter cases of disease, where there is a reasonable probability that extra nourishment will increase the chances of recovery, or will enable the patient to remain at work, or to return to work at an early date. Any articles of diet considered necessary for the particular individual can be ordered, provided the total cost per patient does not exceed ten shillings a week. The financial circumstances of each case are investigated and steps are taken to ensure, as far as possible, that the articles of diet ordered are consumed by the patient. During the year under consideration, 83 patients have been granted extra nourishment under the scheme at a cost of Â£156 6s. 4d. The scheme has been found to be of great help in the treatment of the types of patient mentioned above. Shelters.â€”The two shelters have been in continuous use during the year; and more, if available, could have been utilised. Details of Work During 1922.â€”Table XXX. shows in the first column the number of cases under observation at the Dispensary at the beginning of the year ; then the number of new cases examined during the year ; and, finally, the number of cases under observation pending diagnosis at the end of the year. The total number of cases thus dealt with is divided into three sub-groups, according as they have been found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs or of other organs, or free from tuberculosis. These cases are all divided into groups according to whether adults or children, and also according to sex. After giving the above details regarding all new cases, the table deals with the contacts in a similar manner, and then with the insured persons. Table XXX.

Care CoMiMiTTEE.â€”In November, 1916, the Wandsworth Borough Council, acting on the suggestion of the Ministry of Health, appointed an Interim Tuberculosis Care Committee. Upon the suggestion of the London County Council, the subject was further considered, and a permanent Tuberculosis Care Committee of a representative character was appointed. In November, 1922, letters were received from the Ministry of Health and the London County Council approving the appointment of the permanent Tuberculosis Care Committee for the Borough. In previous years the custom was for the full Care Committee to meet once a monthâ€”with additional meetings of the Sub-Committees on alternate fortnights. During 1922, however, it was found necessary to hold weekly meetings of the full committee alternately at the Wandsworth and Balham Dispensaries. In addition, arrangements have been made for dealing, in consultation with the Tuberculosis Officer, with urgent matters arising between meetings of the Care Committee. In December, 1922, the Committee was unfortunate in losing the services of Miss F. Walker, who has fulfilled the duties of Hon. Secretary since the inception of the Care Committee Scheme. Mr. A. R. Watson, who has had considerable experience in social welfare work, was appointed as successor to Miss Walker. Most of the charitable institutions in the neighbourhood are represented on the Committee, and much valuable assistance has been rendered to the necessitous patients. The help given by the representatives of the Charity Organisation Society and the Invalid Children's Aid Association in arranging for the treatment of adults and children in Convalescent Homes, and in other directions, has been invaluable. Increasing co-operation with local charitable institutions has tended to extend the activities of the Committee, and has provided much useful information regarding dispensary cases. Forty-one advanced cases have been visited regularly at their own homes by Care Committee Visitors in addition to those patients visited by the Dispensary Nurses. Medical and nursing requisites, such as water-beds, air and water cushions, bed-rests, feeding-cups, 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. &c., have been gradually acquired by the Committee, and these articles are provided on loan to necessitous cases. Members of the Committee have also kept in touch with those Dispensary patients who enter St. James' Hospital, 62 of these cases having been visited weekly during the year. These visits are greatly appreciated by the patients. Two beds have been bought by the Committee, and these are of great value in minimising the risk of infection in homes where there is insufficient bed accommodation, One of these has been in constant use in one of the shelters supplied by the Borough Council. Articles of clothing have been supplied to patients in need of it, especially to patients entering institutions. During the year under review it has been found more difficult to obtain suitable employment for patients. The girl patients who were placed as Probationers in Sanatoria last year are still going on with their training, one having been transferred to a General Hospital in Devon to complete her training as a Nurse. Suitable employment has been found with a local firm of gardeners for two young men, and both are making very satisfactory progress. Various other temporary situationsâ€”such as jobbing gardening for men, and house or needle work for womenâ€”have been found from time to time. Further efforts were made during the year to raise funds for the maintenance of beds for advanced cases of tuberculosis at St. Columba's Hospital, Hampstead. Largely through the instrumentality of Mrs. Nicol, the "Streatham New Players" Amateur Dramatic Society gave several performances at the Congregational Church Hall, Streatham, and the amount raised by this means was Â£103. A small Sale of Work arranged by Miss Moores, one of the Dispensary Nurses, realised Â£20 in aid of this fund. As a result of such voluntary efforts, one or more beds have been in use continuously during the year. As there is always great difficulty in arranging for institutional treatment under the London County Council's Scherrle for very advanced cases who are too ill to be treated at home, the beds maintained at St. Columba's Home by this voluntary fund have been of the greatest service. All patients treated in this home have been very grateful for the care and attention given to them. (9323jq e 2 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Sputum Examinations.â€”The number of sputum examinations made during the year shows a large increase on previous years, 1,310 specimens being examined, compared with 1,054 in 1921, 601 in 1920, and 204 in 1919. Of these, 260 or 19-85 per cent, gave a positive result. The increased number is due, mainly, to more frequent examinations of pulmonary cases giving a negative result, a procedure which is very necessary in order to arrive at an accurate opinion of their condition. Cases of all Years Compared.â€”Table XXXIV. shows the number of new cases and total attendances at each of the Dispensaries for the ten years during which they have been open. Table XXXIV.

Each of these divisions is further subdivided according as the disease was or was not of an active nature. (2) Cases where the disease was suspected, but not definite. (3) Cases where there was no evidence of tuberculosis. The classification of inactive disease is only made where there is evidence on examination that the disease has been present at some time or other. A suspicious history by itself is not considered sufficient to warrant the diagnosis of even inactive disease. It is comparatively common to find evidence of inactive disease in the lungs in a person who appears to be well, and sometimes it is found in some other part of the body. When there is active disease in the lungs, in addition to a lesion in some other part of the body, the case is classified as pulmonary. Table XXXV. Year. Definite Cases of Tuberculosis.

Amount of Poor Law Relief. The Clerk to the Board of Guardians has kindly given me the following information with reference to the above for the year ended 31st December, 1922:â€” (1) No. of admissions to the Poor Law Institutions 2,962 (2) No. of medical orders given 2,682 (3) Average No. of persons in receipt of outdoor relief 6,471 (4) Amount of outdoor relief given Â£98,693 The total number of deaths in Poor Law Institutions was 806, or 21.4 per cent, of the total deaths. Of these, only six deaths occurred in a Poor Law Institution in the Borough, and 800 outside the Borough. The extent to which Hospital and other forms of Gratuitous Medical Relief are utilised. This can at present only be given as far as the number of deaths is concerned, as this Department has no means of ascertaining the number of cases from the Borough treated by such institutions. The following Table shows the various institutions in which deaths occurred during the year, and the number of deaths in each. 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table XXXVI.

No vaccination or re-vaccination was performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Small-pox) Regulations during the year. Table XXXVII is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Board of Guardians for the year 1921. It shows the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. Streatham, Balham and Tooting are included under the heading of Streatham.

Scabies. The names of 30 school children, eight from Clapham, two from Putney, three from Streatham, five from Tooting, and 12 from Wandsworth, who were suffering from scabies, were forwarded to me by the Medical Officer to the London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Sanitary Inspector. These children 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. were being treated at the London County Council cleansing stations. In 11 cases where consent was obtained, disinfection of the bedding and clothing of the patient was carried out by the disinfecting staff. In addition to the above, 41 other cases were reported to me. These cases were treated at the baths at the Council's disinfecting station with sulphurated potash baths, and in every case the disease was cured. The average number of baths given per case was three. Disinfection. The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious disease was 5,554 (946 in Clapham, 437 in Putney, 1,434 in Streatham, 781 in Tooting, and 1,956 in Wandsworth). Five public and four private elementary schools were also disinfected on account of various infectious diseases. The approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year, including the cost of disinfectants used in fumigating and cleansing rooms, was Â£2,702 10s. 1d. The number of lots of bedding stoved was 2,446 Cost per lot of bedding Â£1 2s. 1d. Carrier Cases. Very few carrier cases came to the knowledge of the Department during the year under review, but the usual procedure in the case of diphtheria was to keep the children at home, and periodical swabs were taken until two successive negative results were obtained. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. Work of Health Visitors. The duties of the Health Visitors are the same as reported last year, with the addition of visits with regard to non-payment of fees in connection with the Borough Maternity Home. Of the total number of births, viz., 5,570, 4,521 or 81.1 per cent, were visited, compared with 77.18 per cent, in 1921.

Infant Visiting. The total number of visits and re-visits was 9,103, of which 4,521 were first visits, compared with 4,760 in the previous year. The re-visits numbered 4,582 as against 4,878. At the first visit 3,668 were entirely breast-fed, 351 were breastfed supplemented by artificial feeding, and the remainder were entirely bottle fed. On re-visiting 2,223 were found to be entirely breast-fed, 1,180 were breast-fed supplemented by artificial feeding, and the remainder were otherwise fed. 133 of the infants visited died during the year (34 in Clapham, seven in Putney, 23 in Balham, four in Streatham, 21 in Tooting, and 44 in Wandsworth). 122 of the infants visited were prematurely born, and 98 were delicate from birth, 90 twin-births were visited, of whom 10 died. With regard to the employment of midwives, 1,645 mothers had employed their services, 776 infants were born in hospital, maternity homes and other institutions, and two unregistered women were employed. In 2,098 births, doctors have been in attendance. 169 children between the ages of one and two years were visited and 890 were re-visited; 145 children between the ages of two and five years were visited, and 1,420 were re-visited. The small number of first visits to children between the ages of one to two, and two to five years, is due to the fact that most of them had been already visited as infants. The 169 children under two years of age, and 145 between the ages of two to five years were children who had been born elsewhere, and so not previously known and visited. The ante-natal work has developed during the last year owing to the Welfare Centres having ante-natal sessions apart from the Infant Clinics. The visits totalled 582 as against 491 in 1921. The sanitary defects found in the houses during visits to the mothers were all dealt with in the usual way. Cases in which defects were found were referred to me by the Health Visitors, and, in addition, 31 intimation notices were served by the two Health Visitors, who are also Sanitary Inspectors.

Mid wives. The supervision of midwives is under the control of the London County Council, but there is full co-operation between the midwives and the Health Visitors. There are 30 midwives practising in the Borough, of whom nine reside in neighbouring districts. Nurses. Arrangements have been made with various nursing associations in the Borough to attend cases of ophthalmia neonatorum, measles, whooping-cough, diarrhoea, and pneumonia following influenza, measles, or whooping-cough, when and as requested by the Medical Officer of Health at a fee of Is. 3d, per visit. 2,457 such visits were paid during the year. Clapham is served by the South London District Nursing Association ; Putney and Roehampton by the nurses appointed by the Parochial Nursing Associations; and Streatham, Tooting, Wandsworth, and Balham, by Ranyard Nurses, of whom there are 13 working in the Borough, The northern district of Streatham is served by the Brixton Nursing Association. Consultation and Treatment Centres. As no treatment is given at the various Infant Welfare Centres, children are sent to suitable hospitals or to private doctors. The principal diseases found were affections of the eyes, ears, throat or skin, advanced cases of rickets and the like. Maternity Homes. There are 31 private maternity homes in the Borough, nine of which are carried on by practising midwives. Wandsworth Borough Memorial Maternity Home. During the year 398 births occurred in the Borough Memorial Maternity Home, and the following table, copy of which was forwarded to the Ministry of Health early in the current year, shows in detail these cases, the deaths of infants and mothers, the various complications that occurred and the number of times it was necessary for the Matron to call in medical assistance, either for the mother or child. It is most satisfactory that no deaths of mothers occurred. 63 (1) Total number of cases admitted. 398 (Doctor engaged for eight prior to admission).

These eight cases were admitted when the Home was not fully occupied. The greater number of the cases were admitted, as would have been anticipated, from those parts of the Borough nearest the Home. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 65 Hospitals and other Institutions for Expectant and Nursing Mothers, and Young Children, as In-patients. The Streatham Babies' Hospital is the only institution of the kind in the Borough, and infants from any part of the Borough are admitted. The accommodation consists of 20 cots, including two isolation cots. The staff consists of a visiting Medical Officer, matron, sister, two staff nurses (day and night) and three probationers. There is also one domestic servant. The minimum charge is 5s. per week. No child is admitted free except in cases of extreme poverty. One hundred and seventeen infants passed through the hospital during the year, the average stay being 37 days. The complaints from which they suffered were marasmus (47), debility, malnutrition, gastritis, constipation, enteritis, diarrhoea and vomiting, colitis, indigestion, bronchitis, pneumonia, prematurity, congenital heart-disease, insomnia, mongolian cretin, meningitis, nephritis, septic rash, and congenital syphilis. Seventy-four cases were discharged in good health, 16 had improved, and in two cases there was no improvement. Eleven babies died, four from marasmus, one from marasmus and meningitis, one from pneumonia and tonsillitis, one from pneumonia and enteritis, one from pneumonia and influenza, two from acute enteritis, and one from congenital heart-disease. Fifty-four of the 117 cases belonged to the Borough (Clapham, four; Putney, one; Balham, eight; Streatham, 33; Tooting, seven; and Wandsworth, one). Of these, six died, the causes of death being marasmus, three; marasmus and meningitis, pneumonia and influenza, and acute gastritis. There are three institutions in the Borough for the reception of expectant unmarried mothers, all in connection with rescue work. The mothers are received a few months prior to confinement, and are expected to remain, in one instance at least six months after ; in the other two the average stay is three months after confinement. In one home, where the mothers learn glove and stocking making in the home, seven mothers were received during the year. In (9323)q t 66 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. another, 128 mothers passed through the home during the year, the number of births being 120. In the fourth, 18 mothers passed through the home, the number of births being nine. One hostel, also in connection with rescue work, does not receive pre-maternity cases, but makes arrangements for the confinement. The mother is expected to remain 12 monthsâ€”she has three months' training in the home in domestic work, and then goes out to daily work. Twelve mothers and 12 babies passed through the home during the year, the home being closed for six months. In all the above hostels arrangements have been made for a medical man to attend when necessary. Some of the infants attend at the most convenient Infant Welfare Centre. Still-Births. Investigations were made into the cases of 57 still-births, seven of which were premature and 25 were difficult labours, 22 were delivered by midwives, 11 occurred in institutions, and 24 were doctors' cases. Advice was given as to the care of the health of the mother, and in the event of her again becoming pregnant she was invited to attend the Ante-natal Clinic. Convalescent Homes. During the year, 12 mothers with infants, and two children: were sent to Convalescent Homes. Five mothers and infants were sent to the Mothers' Rest Home, Hampstead, five mothers and infants to the Burnett Cottage Home, Heme Bay, one mother and two children to the Church Army Home, Bexhill, one mother tothe Catherine Gladstone Home, Mitcham, and one child to the Marjorie Lumley Home, Maidenhead. Illegitimate Births. Of the 188 illegitimate births belonging to the Borough, 112 have been visited, 13 were above the standard of visiting, 22 had removed before visit, nine died before visit, eight were boarded out under the London County Council, three were adopted, 10 mothers and children went to homes, four wrong addresses were given, and seven of the mothers came to the Borough for confinement only. Of the 112 visited, four died. In the majority of cases no assistance was. required, as arrangements had been made for the care of the children. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 67 Maternity and Child Welfare Centres. There are now eight Infant Welfare Centres in the Borough. Each Centre has a medical officer and a trained Superintendent ; but all the work connected with the keeping of records, the purchase and sale of food and drugs, and of clothing, is done by voluntary workers, who are most regular and efficient. Infants and children up to five years of age are admitted. They are weighed at every attendance, seen by the doctor when necessary, and reports concerning their progress are recorded. The superintendent visits the homes of the children to see that the doctor's instructions are carried out. No visiting by untrained workers is, allowed. In Putney an Ante-natal Centre was started in January, and now each Centre, with the exception of Fairfield, has a separate session for ante-natal work; from Fairfield the mothers go to the Springfield Ante-natal Clinic in Earlsfield Road. The next Table summarises the work done at all the Centres. There were 2,340 new cases registered during the year, the total number of attendances was 34,969, 79 were transferred to other Centres, 1,036 were passed on to the London County Council, and 84 died. The total number of ante-natal cases on the registers during 1922 was 653, the attendances numbering 1,631. The superintendents' visits to infants totalled 10,793, and to ante-natal cases 1,166. 294 health talks were given. In Clapham needlework classes were held at each session of the ante-natal clinic throughout the year, and of the Infant Clinic for nine months. In Putney a course of 12 lectures on Hygiene were given in the spring, and in the autumn a course of 12 needlework classes were held. In Streatham needlework classes are held on alternate Wednesdays. In Tooting needlework classes are held at every ante-natal session, (9323)q F 2 68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. At Springfield Infant Welfare Centre 14 needlework classes were held in the spring, and a course of 10 Health lectures was given in the autumn. The mothers from the Southfield and Fairfield Infant Welfare Centres attended both these courses. 620 attendances were made by the Health Visitors to the Infant Clinics, and 178 to the ante-natal clinics. One of the Health Visitors is a member of the local committee of each Infant Welfare Centre, and the Medical Officer of Health is ex-officio a member of the General Council, whose function is to co-ordinate the work of the Centres. 153 health talks were given by the Health Visitors during the year.

There are four creches in the Boroughâ€”Putney, Balham, Tooting and Wandsworth. Children are admitted whose mothers are obliged to go out to work, or who are ill, or who for any other reasonable cause are unable to look after their children. The creches are voluntary institutions subsidised by grants from the Borough Council and the Board of Education. The parents' payments vary from 8d. to Is. per head, a reduction being made when more than one child from the same family is admitted. The Putney and Wandsworth Day Nurseries are also training schools for nurses who intend to take up creche work. They are admitted as probationers and serve a term of six months, receiving not only practical training but also theoretical. The matrons give courses of lectures, which the probationers are bound to attend, and an examination is held at the end of the course. 132 inspections of the creches were made during the year by the Health Visitors, who represent the Medical Officer of Health on the Committees. The attendances were:â€”In Putney, 5,477; in Balham, 6,511; in Tooting, 4,099; and in Wandsworth, 5,898; a total of 21,985, a decrease of 3,422 compared with 1921. Dental Treatment. In May, 1919, the arrangements made by the Council with the British Dentists' Hospital, Clapham Common, came into force. 61 cases (46 women and 15 children) availed themselves of the opportunity to have dental treatment, and 79 attendances (61 women and 18 children) were made during the year. Two women had dentures supplied to them. The medical officer at each Infant Welfare Centre examines carefully the teeth of the mothers and children, and recommends treatment when necessary. 70 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Puerperal Fever. Three deaths occurred, compared with one in 1921. The death rate was .009 per 1,000, and the case mortality 17 per cent. There were 17 cases of puerperal fever notified (four inClapham, two in Putney, five in Streatham, two in Tooting, and four in Wandsworth). Four were midwives' cases, two were stillborn, four were miscarriages, and three were born before the doctor or midwife arrived. Six patients were removed to hospitals and six to St. James's Infirmary, and five cases occurred in nursing homes. Five of the cases proved fatal. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. 42 cases were notified, of which 10 were in Clapham, two in Putney, 20 in Streatham, three in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth. All the cases were visited. 21 were attended at birth by midwives, and 15 cases occurred in maternity homes (one in Clapham, one in Putney, 12 in Streatham, and one in Tooting). Six cases were treated in hospital as out-patients, 16 as inpatients, and the remainder were treated at home. 24 cases were notified by midwives. In 10 cases the district nurse was asked to attend, and 103 visits were made. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 71 Table XLlI.â€”Ophthalmia Neonatorum, 1922. No. Date of Notification.

The services of a Home Help have been obtained in connection with the Infant Welfare Centres of the Southfield, Fairfield and Springfield Wards of Wandsworth. The woman is paid 30s. a week, with outdoor uniform and overall, fares being allowed up to 2s. 6d. a week. She is required to work eight hours a day, and to do whatever is necessary in the homeâ€”Saturday afternoons and Sundays excepted. The mothers book her services for confinement or sickness, and pay a contribution according to their means to the Infant Welfare Centre. No money is paid by them to the Home Help, nor are meals provided. 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Milk and Food. The Council decided on the 11th April, 1918, to supply, under the Milk (Mothers and Children) Order, milk free of cost to necessitous expectant and nursing mothers, and to children under five years of age. This scheme came into force on the 1st May, 1918. In March, 1921, in Circular 185, the Ministry of Health limited the supply of free milk to nursing mothers, to expectant mothers during the last three months of pregnancy, and to infants and children up to three years of age. Between the ages of three and five years milk may be given on a medical certificate. All applications are investigated, and on the 1st April, 1921, a form of application was adopted, to be filled in by the husband and signed by both husband and wife. Should the income per head, after deducting rent, fall below the scale approved by the Council, as shown in the subjoined table, a 1 lb. packet of dried milk is supplied weekly to an expectant or nursing mother, and to a child under three years of age. In special cases cows' milk is supplied on production of a medical certificate. Two pints of milk, or its equivalent in dried milk, is the maximum amount granted to one family. Cases in which the average income was slightly over the scale and there was need of extra milk, were supplied with milk or dried milk at half cost. During 1922 1,067 familes were supplied with free milk at a cost to the Borouerh Council of /l .845 13s. 3d. In 20 instances dried milk was supplied at half cost. Number in Family.

The Health Visitors report that in many cases the Borough grant of milk has enabled the nursing mother to prolong the period of lactation. The records kept at the Infant Welfare Centres show good results in the health and general welfare of many infants who otherwise would have been insufficiently nourished. Some mothers who, in the Health Visitors' opinion, were not carrying out their maternal duties in a satisfactory manner, either through ignorance or carelessness, have been obliged to attend the Centres in order to obtain milk, with, it is hoped, good results. SANITARY INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. The two following reports were made by Dr. P. Caldwell Smith to the Public Health Committee :â€” 11th May, 1922. " I have made a special inspection of the River Wandle and have to report that little improvement has taken place in its condition. This is wholly, in my opinion, due to the foul condition of the Wandle Valley sewage effluent, and until this effluent has been purified no improvement can be expected. 78 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The cleansing carried out by the London County Council removed a large amount of the foul deposit in the bed of the river, but this deposit is again accumulating and in some places is as great as it was at the date of my last report. I understand that the Ministry of Health has sanctioned the scheme for dealing with the effluent from the Wandle Valley Board, but it will be some time before the works can be commenced. The nuisance from the smell still exists, and I am of opinion that the condition is a menace to the health of the neighbourhood." 6th July, 1922 " Having carefully reconsidered the question, I am still of opinion that mere spraying of the banks of the River Wandle with efther a larvicide or with paraffin would not be of much service in stopping or even to any great extent mitigating the extreme prevalence of mosquitoes (Culex pipiens) in the Wandle area. It would be necessary to carry out much more extensive operations to free this area even for a season from the mosquitoes, among them being the cutting and burning of all grass near the Wandle, the purification of the Wandle itself and some of the few remaining ditches running into it, the use of a larvicide in the water vans to destroy thoroughly all larvae in street gullies, the cleansing of the house gutters in the affected area, and also the abolition of the sewage farms in the neighbourhood. The cost of carrying out the more complete scheme would be very great and would not, in my opinion, justify its adoption. The works already carried out by the Wandsworth Borough Council on the banks of the Wandle at the Southfields Park will improve matters in that area, and if the whole of the Wandle up to the Corruganza Works were dealt with in the same way, I am of opinion that a very marked improvement would be noticed. 79 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The thorough cleansing of the Wandle by the London County Council is very important and should be carried out at an early date. This cleansing would require to be carried out every six months until the scheme for purification of the effluent of the Wandle Valley Sewage Board has been completed. I had previously consulted the highest authorities at the Natural History Museum, and they were of opinion that mere spraying of the ponds and ditches, as well as the banks of the Wandle, would not do much to mitigate the nuisance. Culex pipiens, the mosquito most prevalent, is not known to produce any definite disease, although it causes a good deal of discomfort to many persons. No other variety of mosquitoes has been found in the Wandsworth district, although in parts of Wimbledon Common outside the Borough other varieties have been detected. The ponds on Wimbledon Common are quite free from larvae and require no attention, with one exception, viz., the " Leg of Mutton Pond," which should be cleansed, as well as some of the ditches leading to and from this pond. I have been informed by the Clerk to the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators that the various ponds and damp places have already recently been sprayed with paraffin." 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

All house-to-house inspections under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are carried out as if these were inspections under Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, and the results recorded on a special card which was drawn up in 1910 and has been in use since that date. This method has been found to work most satisfactorily. Where nuisances are found, notices are served 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. under the Public Health Act, and if the premises are reported by the Sanitary Inspector to be in a bad condition, I make a personal inspection in order to determine if the houses are in such a condition as to be unfit for human habitation. During the year, 2,714 houseto-house inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors, and in 2,358 nuisances were found necessitating the service of sanitary notices. The total number of houses where the drains were reconstructed during the year was 138 ; 42 in Clapham, 25 in Putney, 19 in Streatham, three in Tooting, and 49 in Wandsworth. During the year 3,507 drains of houses were tested by the Sanitary Inspectors ; 454 in Clapham, 515 in Putney, 1,100 in Streatham, 281 in Tooting, and 1,157 in Wandsworth, and 423, or 12 06 per cent., were found to be defective. Of the 423 found defective, 49 were in Clapham, 51 in Putney, 108 in Streatham, 70 in Tooting, and 145 in Wandsworth. A large amount of work has again been carried out to abate nuisances arising from damp conditions. In all, 1,438 premises have been dealt with ; 148 in Clapham, 228 in Putney, 313 in Streatham, 208 in Tooting, and 541 in Wandsworth ; and in 162 of these, 25 in Clapham, 25 in Putney, 67 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 38 in Wandsworth, damp courses have been inserted. Removal of House Refuse. During the year no alteration has been made in the system of removal. The whole of the refuse is now collected and disposed of by contract, with the exception of a portion from the Balham, Streatham and Tooting Wards, which is disposed of at the Destructor. 109 statutory notices were served under Section 37 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide ashpits in accordance with the By-laws, and these have been complied with.

Underground Rooms. There are now no rooms, as far as is known, which do not comply with the Regulations made by the Council in 1911. It was not necessary to take any action, as in former years inspections of these were made and the necessary alterations carried out. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. There has been an increase in the total number of inspections of the above, compared with 1921, although the number of factories, etc., on the Register is less. An examination of the Tables will show that a very large amount of work has been carried out by both the male and female inspectors. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. â–  â– â–  â–  INSPECTION OF FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES.

The number of notices sent to employers during the year was 38, and these had a most satisfactory result. During the year 39 cases of infective diseasesâ€”10 of Scarlet Fever, three of Diphtheria, 20 of Measles, one of Erysipelas, and five of Whooping-coughâ€”were notified as having occurred in the homes of outworkers. In none of these cases was it necessary to make any order under Section 110 of the Factory and Workshop Act. Table LIV. 4.â€”REGISTERED WORKSHOPS.

Canal Boats Act. During the year five inspections of Canal Boats were made, but it was not necessary to serve any notices, as on inspection the condition of all the boats was found to be satisfactory. Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920. 140 applications for Certificates under the above Act were received during the year. On inspection it was found that 131 (9323)q H 98 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. of the premises were not reasonably fit for human habitation, and Certificates were granted, and nine premises were reasonably fit, and Certificates were consequently not granted. Of the 131 premises where Certificates were granted, 125 were rendered reasonably fit during the year, and the remaining six are in hand. FOOD. Milk Supply. The milk supplied to this Borough has been, during the year, of fair quality, very few complaints having been made with regard to its wholesomeness or purity. The average fat content shown by the samples analysed was 3-52 per cent., compared with 3-56 in 1921. So far as could be ascertained, there was no shortage of milk supplied to the Borough, the supply being equal to the demand. There are at present three cowsheds and 238 milk retailers on the Register, and these have been regularly inspected during the year. Particulars of these are given in Table LVI. During the year under review the Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922, came into operation. This Act prohibits the sale of milk from cows suffering from Tuberculosis of the udder. Five samples of milk were examined, and certificates received stated that in each case the examination revealed no evidence of the presence of Tubercle Bacilli. 99 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In one case proceedings were taken against a cowkeeper for selling milk deficient in milk fat to the extent of 7 per cent. The defendant stated that the deficiency was due to the interval of milking. This was tested and found correct. The summons was dismissed on payment of costs, the defendant promising to regulate the interval of milking more evenly. Section 4, Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922. Cases of contravention of this Section were dealt with under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Meat. There are no public abattoirs in the Borough, and the Sanitary Inspectors periodically inspect the slaughterhouses and arrange as far as possible to be there on the days that slaughtering of animals takes place. 122 inspections of the 10 slaughterhouses were made during the year, and 2,338 carcases were examined by the Inspectors. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 101 No action has been taken with regard to unsound meat, and no carcases were condemned during the year. By far the greater proportion of the meat sold in the Borough has been inspected in the Central Markets before being sold to retailers. In 1914. In January, 1922. In December, 1922.

Statement of Work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the year 1,989 samples of foods and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of these samples, 1,044 were purchased as test or informal samples, while 945 were purchased officially. Of the 945 official samples submitted for analysis, 35, or 3-7 per cent., were reported to be adulterated or not up to standard, and of those samples which were purchased informally or as test samples, 67, or 6.4 per cent., were found adulterated or not up to standard. The total adulterations reported were 102, or 5.1 per cent., of the samples submitted. The percentage of milk samples found to be adulterated was 2.8. In 19 out of the 35 cases in which adulterations were detected in the official samples, proceedings were instituted against the vendor, and the total amount received in penalties under the above Acts during the year amounted to Â£32 10s., and the costs to Â£11 13s., making a total of Â£44 3s. The following Table shows the number of formal and informal samples taken in each sub-district of the Borough, together with the number taken per 1,000 of population, the number adulterated, and the percentage adulterated to the formal and informal and to the total samples taken:â€” Table LVII. â€” Informal Samples.

MILK. 958 samples of milk were procured for analysis during the year. 27, or 2.8 per cent., were reported against as being adulterated or not up to legal standard. 930 samples were purchased officially, of which 25, or 2.6 per cent., were adulterated, and 28 samples purchased informally, of which two, or 7.2 per cent., were adulterated. Nine samples were found to contain added water, 15 were deficient in milk fat, and one was deficient in milk fat and contained added water. Proceedings were taken in nine cases, and in 16 cases the Public Health Committee, after considering the amount of adulteration and the circumstances of sale, decided not to prosecute the vendors, but to take further samples. 16 samples of milk were taken on delivery at various Public Institutions situated within the Borough. All these samples were genuine. 54 samples of milk were procured whilst in transit from the farmer to the retailer, the samples being taken as the milk arrived at various railway stations within the Borough, both at midnight and mid-day deliveries. Six samples were reported against, and in one case proceedings were taken against the farmer, who pleaded warranty. Three samples of milk were procured during the early morning from wholesale dealers whilst delivering milk to the retailer. These samples were genuine. Five samples of milk were procured on delivery at private houses. One sample was reported against. 140 samples of milk have been taken on Sundays, either in the early morning or at mid-day. Three, or 2.1 per cent., were reported against as being adulterated. 421 samples of milk were taken from milk vendors in the street during the early morning (i.e., 5 to 7 a.m.), on week days, and of these 16, or 3.9 per cent., were reported against. 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Statement of Work done under the Rag Flock Act, 1911. 24 workshops were visited by the Inspector, and the materials used for bedding and upholstery were examined. 19 samples were procured and submitted for analysis. All these were reported as complying with the standard of cleanliness required. 13 Certificates have been issued in respect of the sterilisation of materials used in the manufacture of Rag Flock. Revenue Act. During the year nine certificates were granted under the above Act. The certificates granted referred to 26 houses or 36 tenements. Cleansing of Persons Act. The names of 218 children, 61 belonging to Clapham, 13 to Putney, 16 to Streatham, seven to Tooting, and 121 to Wandsworth, stated to be in a verminous condition, were forwarded to me by the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Inspectors. In 81 cases the body and clothing were stated to be also verminous. These children were cleansed by the officials of the London County Council at the Cleansing Station under the supervision of that Authority. 44 adults and two children had baths on account of their verminous condition, 41 of these being cases of scabies. Cutting-off Notices. During the year, 129 notices with respect to 156 premises were received from the Water Board stating that the supply had been withdrawn. 29 of the premises were in Clapham, 19 in Putney, 54 in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 47 in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 77 premises, from 50 premises in consequence of defects, in 27 the premises were empty, and in two cases by request. 108 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Rateable Value. The rateable value of the Borough, on the 6th April, 1922, was Â£2,274,272, and the estimated value of a penny rate was Â£9,157. Housing. It was found at the Census of 1921 that the total number of houses structurally separate for habitation was 62,540, and the total number of rooms occupied was 373,204, the average number of persons per house was 5.2, and the average number of persons per room was .87. There are only three other Boroughs in London, viz., Lewisham, Kensington and Hampstead, where the average number of persons per room was smaller, the average for the whole of London being 1.07. If these statistics are correct it shows that in the Borough of Wandsworth there cannot be so much overcrowding as in some of the other Boroughs. There has been some addition to the housing accommodation during the year by the erection of new houses (1) by the London County Council; (2) by the Borough Council; and (3) by private enterprise. The total number erected and occupied was 846, and the number in course of erection at the end of the year was 48. The action taken by the Borough Council is referred to in more detail in previous reports.
