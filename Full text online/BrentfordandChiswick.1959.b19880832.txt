Scutchings BOROUGH OF BRENTFORD AND CHISWICK Public Health Department, Town Hall, Chiswick, W. 4. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the 32nd Annual Report on the health of the population of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick. The general standard of health throughout the Borough remained good in 1959. Epidemic disease was absent but in the early part of the year a certain amount of minor influenza affected a proportion of the people, school children in perticular. There was a rise in the birth rate, a fall in the death rate, but the infant mortality rate showed an increase. The satisfactory figure of only two deaths from tuberculosis, the former 'white plague' of this country, was counterbalanced somewhat by the absence of reduction in the notifications of this disease. Prom the infectious disease statistics it is a little disturbing to notice the return of scarlet fever which had appeared to be almost eliminated. The amount of work still being found to be required to bring food premises in the Borough up to statutory standards was considerable and the number of items of unsound food offered for sale and requiring official action was greater than in previous years. Much attention is required to be given to individual cases of neglected aged persons, and every effort is made to secure for them not only those services to which they are entitled but, by a combination of the facilities of the statutory bodies and the various welfare organisations, to restore them, without interfering unduly into their privacy or injuring their feelings of independence or their personal dignity, to healthier and happier living conditions. The Mealson-Wheels Service, steadily expanding, is greatly appreciated, and has in many cases saved elderly people from slow starvation. More new houses were built during the year and progress in slum clearance was good. These facts combined with the other fact that vacancies for employment continued to outnumber persons employable are good to observe as for physical and mental health useful and satisfying work and a good home are two of the greatest assets. The first part of the Clean Air programme was made official in 1959 by the making of an Order to free an area of approximately one eighth of Brentford and Chiswick from atmospheric pollution by smoke. This annual review of the work of the Department to me is always astonishing and always fascinating. New problems arise and new ways have to be found of dealing with them. Much time and much patience used up with apparently little resulting suddenly are more than compensated because a number of cold uninteresting looking figures in some Table in the Report means that lives are being saved, or lifelong illhealth or mental disease being prevented. Nevertheless defeat and despair can occur, the battle with disease from dirt and squalor was succeeded by the war on bacteria, and as this is being gradually won, virus diseases and cancer advance into the field. -7- It is with pleasure that I record here my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for all their consideration and support during the year and also my thanks to all members of the Staff of the Department for their work and helpfulness at all times. I am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Mangand G. gless. Medical Officer of Health Acknowledgements to:- P.R.J. Arnold, Esq., Dr. T. M. Pollock, Dr. G. Z. Brett, Dr. R.

Rate (1958-1959) £4,659 The Borough is divided into nine Wards BRENTFORD Brentford East Brentford West Brentford Central CHISWICK Chiswick Park Grove Park Bedford Park Gunnersbury Old Chiswick Turnham Green In the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick the eastern half is mainly residential with a certain number of industrial buildings of the smaller type interspersed throughout, while in the western half there is a highly industrialised section chiefly situated along the Great West Road. There are 630 acres of open space within the Borough with ample facilities for refreshment and recreation both for the public in general and for the sporting activities of particular groups. The proportion of open space to the total area of the Borough is approximately 25% a very reasonable proportion for an urban area. The residents of the Borough are of mixed categories including professional and clerical people of all grades, artisans, factory workers etc., and the types of dwellings vary from flatted houses and cottages to large detached residences in their own surrounding grounds. The amount of slum property is not considerable and progress is now being made with the demolition of houses which are no longer fit for human habitation. The rehousing of the tenants in council houses, details concerning assessment of slum dwellings, demolition and the building of new houses are supplied later in this Report. In the 1956 and 1957 Annual Reports it was possible to state that the number of cases of statutory overcrowding known to the Public Health Department had diminished, but since then this was no longer the case as there was an increase in 1958 and again in 1959 both in the number of people coming to complain of living in overcrowded conditions and in the number actually proved to be statutorily overcrowded under the terms of the Housing Act. -9- There was an increase in the number of new houses built in the Borough during 1959, so that although the requirements for slum clearance area tenants, and for the occupants of requisitioned properties continued to be considerable, it was possible for the Housing Committee to resume, after a lapse of some years, the allocation of a few newly built dwellings to applicants on the waiting list and so in 1959 twelve cases of statutory overcrowding were rehoused as compared with four in 1958. The unemployment figures for adult persons i.e. aged 18 and over, in the Borough at the end of 1959, reflected the national general increase in the number of jobs available due to greater industrial activity. On the 7th December, 1959, there were 235 unemployed altogether, of which 180 were men and 55 women. This compares with 223 men and 58 women unemployed at the end of 1958, and 140 men and 42 women unemployed at the end of 1957. On 2nd December, 1959, the number of jobs vacant totalled 347, (227 at the same date in 1958) of which 197 were for men and 150 for women, i.e. there were 50% more vacancies than there were unemployed persons seeking vacancies. The unemployment figures at the end of 1959 of young persons under 18 years of age were as follows:- Boys Gir1s Total Number of young persons (other than school leavers) registered as unemployed on 31.12.59 7 5 12 Boys and Girls who left school at Christmas to enter employment 57 52 109 Totals 64 57 121 Vacancies outstanding at 31.12.59 90 151 241 The number of vacancies is a little deceptive since the Christmas leavers had still to be placed in work after 31st December, also the choice of work with good training prospects for boys leaving school was not so great as in recent years.

Capacity 12,049 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1959 64,464 Average number per day 214 Maximum number using baths on one day 638 Chiswick Open Air Swimming Pools:- Large Pool Area 7,500 sq.ft. Capacity 33,750 c. ft. Small Pool Area 3,500 sq.ft. Capacity 18,375 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1959 152,621 Average number per day 1,024 Maximum number using baths on one day 4,554 The source of the water in the swimming baths is the mains supply of the Metropolitan Water Board. In both the indoor bath and the outdoor pools the water goes through a continuous filtration process, the rate of change-over being about once every three hours in the indoor bath and about once every ten hours in the open air pools, though this latter rate is speeded up during periods of heavy use of the pools. Topping up to allow for loss by evaporation or removal is done several times weekly. Additional purification is carried out by means of intermittent chlorination, the amount of free chloride aimed at being 0.6 parts per million. Water samples are taken two to three times daily throughout the season for the purposes of chemical analysis and pH estimation. Bacteriological sampling carried out in 1959 showed a complete freedom from all bacteria. During 1959 although there was no chemical or bacteriological fault, the filter in Brentford Bath was renewed because of age and the baths were closed to the public for approximately one month in early summer. The brilliance of the 1959 summer is reflected in the figures for swimming pool attendances, there being an increase of over 30% in Brentford (even although the baths were not available for one month of the summer), and approximately 90% increase in Chiswick. Paddling Pools - Duke's Meadows:- Area (2 pools each 60' x 60') 7,200 sq.ft. Depth 6" to 1' in middle These paddling pools are filled daily from the mains supply and ½ pint of Chloros is added at each filling. They are open from approximately 1st April to 30th September each year, according to weather condition. Other Facilities in the Borough for Open Air Recreation Privately owned open spaces and sports grounds 111.71 acres Council owned open spaces and sports grounds leased to private clubs etc. 67.94 „ School playing fields 50.50 " Gunnersbury Park (owned jointly by Acton, Brentford & Chiswick and Ealing Councils) 186.00 " -11- Public Baths and Washhouses Brentford: In Clifden Road, Brentford, the Council maintains premises containing 21 slipper baths, 14 for men, and 7 for women. The total number using the baths during 1959 was 21,350 persons. Chiswick:- In Belmont Road, Chiswick, the Council maintains premises containing 31 slipper baths, 22 for men, and 9 for women. In addition, 2 hip baths are available particularly for the use of elderly persons. The total number using the baths during 1959 was 42,460 persons. In these premises are also 30 washing compartments comprising 30 coppers, a rinsing section, 30 drying horses, hot air drying compartments and 2 mangling machines. Ratepayers are entitled to use these washing facilities at a small charge of 6d per hour, and during 1959, 1,708 persons took advantage of the service. -12- VITAL STATISTICS, 1959 Live Births Total Male Female Legitimate 739 389 350 Birth Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 14.25 Illegitimate 73 42 31 TOTAL 812 431 381 Stillbirths Total Male Female Legitimate 11 6 5 Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) Births - 14.56 Illegitimate 1 1 - TOTAL 12 7 5 Deaths Total Male Female 600 314 286 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 10.53 Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis 1 Rate per 1,000 total Other Puerperal Causes - (live and still) Births - 1.21 Deaths of Infants under 1 Year of Age Total Male Female Legitimate 21 11 10 Illegitimate 1 - 1 TOTAL 22 11 11 -13- Deaths and Death Rate There was a fall in the death rate, the figure of 10.53 comparing with one of 11.22 for the previous year. The lowest death rate ever recorded in the Borough was 10.16 in 1953. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. In 1959, this factor is 1.0 and so the corrected death rate is the same as the crude death rate i.e. 10.53. The corrected rate for Middlesex County was 11.4, and the rate for England and Wales was 11.6, so the figure for Brentford and Chiswick was well below both the County and the National rates. Death Rate of all infants per 1,000 live births 27.09 Deaths from Measles (all ages) Nil Deaths from Whooping Cough (all ages) Nil Deaths from Diarrhoea or Gastro-Enteritis (under 2 years) Nil Deaths from Cancer (all ages) 121 Deaths from Tuberculosis (all ages) 2 Table I gives a list of Causes of Death as classified according to the International system agreed by the World Health Organisation and in operation since November, 1949. The principal causes of death were:- 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 Circulatory Disease (including coronary disease) 201 222 215 224 206 205 Heart Disease 76 99 82 91 96 98 Cancer 121 127 131 150 136 159 It will be seen that the three principal causes of death all show reduced figures in 1959. Although the total reduction in the number of deaths from Cancer was not great, the distribution of these deaths was interesting as there was a reduction of 16 male deaths but an increase of 10 female deaths. Deaths from lung cancer (male and female) have been falling, these totalled 34 (30 male 4 female) in 1957, 33 (29 male 4 female) in 1958, and 26 (25 male 1 female) in 1959. As the increase in this disease has been causing much concern nationally, it is interesting to note the improvement in the local figures. The distribution of cancer deaths in sites and ages is shown below.

This occurred in hospital. There were 2 deaths from tuberculosis in 1959, as compared with 7 in 1958. This is the lowest number of tuberculous deaths ever recorded in one year.

The ages of these cases were:- Males: 18, 18, 22, 31, 53, 82 Females: 50, 61, 80, 81 Two of these died as a result of accidents within the Borough. In all, 6 persons, including residents of other places, died as a result of road accidents occurring in Brentford and Chiswick, 2 motor cyclists, 2 motor vehicle -15- passengers, and 2 pedestrians. No child died on the roads of the Borough during 1959. Birth Rate The Birth Rate rose from 14.0 in 1958 to 14.25 in 1959. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This, then gives a comparative birth rate of 13.54 compared with 16.5 for England and Wales as a whole. INFANT MORTALITY During 1959 the number of live births recorded was 812, 739 legitimate and 73 illegitimate. There were 12 still-births, 7 male and 5 female. There were 22 deaths of infants under 1 year of age (as compared with 14 in 1958), giving an infant mortality rate of 27.09 for 1959. The local figure compares with an infant mortality rate of 22.0 for England and Wales, and is the highest recorded for a number of years, the last year in which it was greater being 1951. The graph on page 17 shows the progress of Infant Mortality since the beginning of the century. The number of premature infants born in 1959 was 54, including premature stillbirths. Of the 51 premature infants born alive, 3 were born at home, (all of these survived to the end of one month), 48 were born in hospital, of whom 43 survived to the end of one month. The percentage of premature infants to total births (live and still) is 6.6. The following figures show the percentages of premature infants to total births (live and still) since 1950. 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 3.3 4.5 5.6 4.9 6.0 6.9 6.4 8.4 7.3 6.6 Causes of infants deaths are shown in Table II on page 66. MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY Deaths from Puerperal Causes:- Puerperal Sepsis 1 Other Causes Nil This maternal death occurred on the 14th day after confinement. The patient was delivered in Hospital by Caesarean section, and died there after a further operation. During the year, 70 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified as compared with 58 in 1958. Four cases occurred after home confinement, 66 were notified from Chiswick Maternity Hospital. 12 of the cases were residents of the Borough. One death of a resident of the Borough took place in a hospital in another area and was attributed to this cause. The definition of puerperal pyrexia for notification purposes is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after child-birth or miscarriage". -16- GRAPH "A" GRAPH SHOWING INFANTILE MORTALITY RATES DURING THE PERIOD 1900 - 1959 -17- PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES CONTROL OF VERMIN AND SCABIES By the courtesy of the School Medical Officer particulars regarding the cleanliness surveys in schools have been obtained, and are as follows:- Number of children examined:- Primary Schools 6,585 Secondary Modern Schools 3,396 9,981 Number of children requiring treatment 77 Number of children in respect of whom cleansing notices were issued 60 Number of children cleansed by Local Health Authority 42 Although there appears to be a smaller number of infested cases, this may only be because of a considerable drop in the total number of children examined, and indeed there is an increase in the number of compulsory cleansings, which means that 42 children were severely infested and possibly not for the first time. The fact that adult and adolescent relatives of schoolchildren can act as reservoirs of infestation is often the reason for the recurrent need for treatment of individual children. There are no statutory powers to enforce the inspection of adult contacts. By arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health of Hammersmith, persons requiring cleansing because of infestation with scabies or vermin, can be treated at the Hammersmith Cleansing Station. During 1959, 13 persons were referred for cleansing, all for scabies. INFECTIOUS DISEASE In the year 1959 there was an increase in the incidence of infectious disease. This was due mainly to a rise in the scarlet fever notifications. Measles The following figures of measles notifications show the fluctuations of this disease during the past ten years. 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 269 863 413 810 47 659 107 773 330 328 Poliomyelitis Two notifications of poliomyelitis were received during the year, and both cases were confirmed as paralytic poliomyelitis. -18- Poliomyelitis Statistics since 1949 Confirmed cases Died Still making progress Condition stationary Fully recovered 1949 4 - - 1 3 1950 9 - - 3* 6 1951 - - - - - 1952 9 2 - 2# 5 1953 6 1 - - 5 1954 3 - - 1 2 1955 5 - - 3# 2 1956 2 - - - 2 1957 2 - - 1 1 1958 2 - 1 - 1 1959 2 - 1 - 1 *1 now left district #2 now left district It can be seen from these figures that of 44 confirmed cases of paralytic poliomyelitis occurring during the past 11 years, 28 have made a complete recovery with full power and normal movement of all muscles. The Scheme for inoculation against poliomyelitis inaugurated by Middlesex County Health Department in 1956, continued during 1959. Details of the year's work are as follows:- No. of persons who received two injections during the year Persons Children Expectant G.Ps and Ambulance Hospital born born Mothers families personnel staff 1933-42 1943-58 2,106 2,111 326 11 7 1 Details are given below of persons who received a third injection during 1959. They have already been recorded as having two injections. Persons Children Expectant G.P's and Ambulance Hospital born born Mothers families personnel staff 1933-42 1943-58 357 4,237 236 9 3 1 By the end of the year 8,335 children under 16 had obtained two injections. Puerperal Pyrexia The number of notifications of puerperal pyrexia rose from 58 in 1958 to 70 in 1959. There was no severe infection, these puerperal pyrexia cases were mild and mostly notified under the statutory requirement to notify any temperature rise to over 100° after confinement in the immediate post-natal period. -19- Smallpox During the year no cases of smallpox occurred in the Borough, nor were there any contacts of confirmed cases. Notification of smallpox contacts is always received from Port or Airport authorities as soon as, or before they enter the district. Vaccination against Smallpox The following information regarding vaccination against smallpox carried out in the Borough during 1959 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer. Number of persons who during the year were:- Age groups Total Under 1 l 2-4 5-14 15 & over vaccinated for first time 465 22 11 10 17 525 re-vaccinated - - 1 11 74 86 Total 465 22 12 21 91 611 Total number of first vaccinations:- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 298 373 548 487 438 418 430 531 525 There was a slight drop in the total number of first vaccinations during 1959, and the really important figure, i.e. first vaccinations of infants under one year old, remained at the same level as last year. Taking the figure of the number of infants born during the year as a basis, the percentage vaccinated in the first year of life was 57.3 in 1959. This compares with 57.3% in 1958, 42.3% in 1957, 43.7% in 1956, 47.5% in 1955, 50% in 1954 and 55% in 1953. Scarlet Fever There was a further considerable rise in the number of cases of scarlet fever notified and confirmed as such, the figures being 91 in 1959 as compared with 44 in 1958 and 24 in 1957. 21 of these cases were admitted to hospital. This disease, which was being regarded by many as practically eliminated, seems again to be on the increase and is by no means to be considered as free from danger, since virulence increases with the passage from one stricken case to another, and there is no immunisation procedure that is effective. Also the over use of penicillin and the anti-bacterial fungi may be creating bacterial resistance in streptococci as has been the case with the anti-tuberculous drugs. Scarlet Fever still merits great watchfulness and good isolation of contacts. In five instances a second case occurred in the household in which a previous case had been notified. Of the school children affected, the majority were scattered throughout the Borough and also throughout the year, but three schools, one in Brentford and two in Chiswick, had a relatively high proportion of the cases. There was however, no concentration either in time or in classes to indicate the need for large scale carrier investigation. -20- One case in April occurred in a child living in a Children s Home in Chiswick, which necessitated a good deal of investigation and tracing of contacts, but no second case occurred. Twenty-two throat swabs taken in connection with this investigation proved negative for infection. A case in September occurred in a Day Nursery and investigations were made and visits paid by the Area Medical Officer. The staff of the Nursery had throat swabs taken which proved negative for infection and no second case occurred. Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria occurred during the year. The last confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough occurred in 1948. Information concerning immunisation against diphtheria in the Borough during 1959 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer, and is as follows:- Number of children who Age Total Under 1 l 2-4 5-14 completed a full course of primary immunisation 439 146 24 12 621 received reinforeing injections - - 1 14 15 Number of children at 31.12.59 who had completed a course of diphtheria immunisation at any time before that date (i.e. at any time since 1.1.45). Age at 31.12.59 i.e. born in year Under 1 1959 1-4 1958-55 5-9 1953-49 10-14 1948-44 Total under 15 Last complete course of injections (whether primary or booster) A. 1955 - 59 217 1,943 2,427 2,249 6,836 B. 1954 or earlier - - 448 1,189 1,637 There was a most satisfactory increase in the number of children receiving a full course of immunisation against diphtheria during the year. Whooping Cough 41 cases of whooping cough occurred in 1959. This figure was greater than in the previous year, but there was no sign of outbreak. Immunisation against whooping cough is fairly general now, the inoculation being carried out either simultaneously with that for immunisation against diphtheria, or in series alternating with anti-diphtheria inoculation. The fact that such an increase occurred, however, must be observed and noted. No deaths occurred from this disease during 1959. -21- Food Poisoning Twenty-three notifications of food poisoning were received during the year. The organism identified in one of these cases was Shigella Sonnei and in three the organism identified was Salmonella Typhi-murium. One case notified as dysentery was subsequently confirmed as food poisoning-Salmonella Typhi-murium. A complaint was received from a resident that her granddaughter had been made ill by eating a sandwich of chicken and lettuce in a London cafe. Analysis of the sandwich, we were informed from the local Medical Officer of Health, yielded Clostridium Welchii - a food poisoning organism. It was impossible to persuade the parents of the child to provide faeces specimens for testing, so no clear follow-up was obtained. The child had recovered quickly from the mild stomach upset. A man who worked in Chiswick, but did not live in the Borough, developed food poisoning after attending a Works party in Marylebone. He was one of over 100 guests affected. The organism responsible for his illness was Salmonella Typhi-murium. No spread of this infection occurred. Dysentery Ten persons were notified as suffering from dysentery, the organism in seven cases being Shigella Sonnei and in one Shigella Plexner. One case was subsequently confirmed as food poisoning-Salmonella Typhi-murium. The tenth case, amoebic dysentery, was notified in November and was a boy in care at a Children's Hostel in Brentford. The only possible source of infection was a South Coast Holiday Camp at which the boy had stayed, but although he had symptoms of gastro-enteritis after attending this camp, amoebae were not formed until his later attack, by which time the camp had broken up and staff contacts were impossible to trace. Investigation of contacts at the Children's Hostel gave negative results, so no spread of infection had occurred. One case notified as food poisoning was subsequently confirmed as sonne dysentery. Influenza There was a considerable incidence of influenza in the early part of the year, with complications of bronchitis and pneumonia, causing the hospital admission rate to rise steeply in the first weeks of January. Five deaths were attributed to influenza, and the general death rate from respiratory diseases was slightly greater than in the previous year. Typhoid Fever A case of this disease occurred in the Borough in 1959. The patient was an air hostess just returned from Jamaica and having been before that in China. Contact tracing was somewhat difficult in this case because of the itinerant nature of the profession of the patient and her friends, but no second case occurred. Tuberculosis The number of notifications of tuberculosis in 1959 was 73 as compared with 76 in the previous year, the pulmonary cases amounting to 70 and the non-pulmonary to 3. The number of deaths from this disease was two (the lowest ever recorded in the Borough) as compared with seven in 1958, four in 1957, six in 1956, seven in 1955 and four in 1954. -22- The figure of 73 notifications includes 38 inward transfers i.e. cases notified because they had removed into the borough but who had previously contracted the disease elsewhere. This leaves a total of 35 new cases of tuberculosis occurring within the borough compared with the figure of 50 new cases in 1958. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis as well as prevention and after care are provided by the Hounslow Chest Clinic, and home visiting is carried out by Health Visitors attached to this Clinic. They are also responsible for the examination of contacts and for the B.C.G. inoculation for the prevention of tuberculosis. B.C.G. inoculation is now offered to all the Mantoux negative, i.e. susceptible contacts of newly discovered tuberculosis cases; 76 residing in this Borough were inoculated during 1959. A prominent part in the treatment is played by domiciliary chemo-therapy (i.e. treatment with suitable drugs or injections given at home) on the recommendation of the Chest Physician, with the aid of the Home Nurses (formerly District Nurses) provided by the Middlesex County Council. Apart from institutional treatment provided by the local Hospital Management Committees of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in General Hospitals and in Chest Hospitals, there is also a Middlesex County Council Hostel for chronic ambulant male tuberculous patients. Facilities for convalescence, rehabilitation and training are provided by the Middlesex County Council and the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. The social side of the treatment and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis is dealt with by the Welfare Department of the Hounslow Chest Clinic. Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial During 1959, the Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial which commenced in 1950 and has been commented on yearly in the Annual Report, continued in Brentford and Chiswick. In September, 1959, the Second Progress Report of the investigation was published. It shows that B.C.G. vaccination confers a very substantial protection against tuberculosis which persists for a least 7½ years after being given. Vaccination of school children will contribute very substantially, therefore, to the reduction of tuberculosis in adolescents and young adults. This assessment of the potentialities of B.C.G. vaccine has been made possible by the close co-operation of the many local health authorities throughout the country. The work has involved the home visiting and X-raying of large numbers of participants of whom 191 belonged to this Borough. In 1959, the Medical Research Council X-ray Unit visited Brentford Health Centre and 168 of the original 191 were invited to attend. The number who attended for X-ray was 101. In view of the duration of the investigation, the proportion of participants who continued to attend for X-ray is highly satisfactory. It is expected that the Trial will continue in its present form until August, 1960, and the final visit to Brentford will be paid beginning Tuesday, 26th April, 1960. At this visit it is hoped to X-ray as many as possible of the participants still living in the area. -23- Investigation of New Tuberculosis in the Adolescent On this subject there is nothing to add. During 1959, no further reviews of volunteers under this scheme, started in 1953 for the investigation of the high incidence of tuberculosis among young adults, were carried out. B.C.G. Vaccination As a result of the findings from the tuberculosis vaccinations clinical trial that a degree of protection could be afforded by the vaccination of school children with B.C.G., a scheme was inaugurated in the County of Middlesex for the tuberculin testing and, if necessary, vaccination of school children at the age of 13. During 1959, 251 children were invited to take part in the scheme, 218 consents were received. These children were tuberculin tested, and those found to be positive, indicating a previous infection with tuberculosis of a minor or major degree at some period in their lives, were referred to the Chest Clinic for thorough investigation. 28 positives were so referred. B.C.G, vaccination was carried out on 100 children. No contacts of cases of tuberculosis were referred to the Chest Clinic. All tests and vaccinations during 1959 under this scheme were carried out by the Tuberculosis Unit of the Medical Research Council. HOUSING CONDITIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1959 The housing conditions of 57 of the 73 cases of tuberculosis were found to be as follows: - 56 patients lived in sufficiently satisfactory housing accommodation, 32 in flats, 12 in houses, 12 in lodgings or furnished rooms. One patient lived in overcrowded housing conditions, a house let in rooms, but the room overcrowding could be overcome by re-arrangement of the other occupants of the dwelling. The housing particulars of 15 cases were not obtainable either because of removal of patients to other districts or because of resistance of patients to home visiting. Six new notifications came from homes already returning one or more cases of tuberculosis. 38 cases were inward transfers from other districts and, therefore, had not developed their illness while resident in Brentford and Chiswick. The position regarding cases living in unsatisfactory or overcrowded conditions, outstanding from previous years, is as follows: - Year Cases No. where Conditions improved 1958 4 3 1954 1 - 1953 5 3 Mass X-ray During 1959, the mobile Mass X-ray unit made one short visit to the Borough to a small factory. 142 people were X-rayed there and no case of active tuberculosis was found. 24 It is now possible to send persons desirous of availing themselves of the facility, to a static Mass X-ray Unit at West Middlesex Hospital without an appointment on any day of the week, to have an X-ray of the chest. This is a very valuable addition to the armaments of preventive medicine and is made use of by many who need reassurance because of vague suspicions of contact. It is particularly useful to the Public Health Department for the obtaining of quick reports on candidates for employment on the Borough Council staff. 25 GRAPH "Bn GRAPH OF CASES NOTIFIED AND DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE PERIOD 1939 - 1959 26 FOOD CONTROL Routine work on the improvement of hygienic conditions and of methods of food handling continued throughout the year. There is no doubt that year by year a great improvement can be seen in shops and catering establishments in the methods of display of food for sale, and the limitation of handling. The general public is becoming more sensitive to these matters and when trade is seen to come from the less hygienic to the more hygienic establishment, this is a much more powerful incentive to the trader than all the propaganda which this Department can put over. Word of mouth recommendation is still the best publicity and recently I have overheard customers in shops explaining to others that the reason they used such and such a store was because "everything is kept covered" or "the girls look so clean there". This is an interesting new development since formerly quality of goods, price or civility of staff were the usual reasons given for preference of one shop to another. Although there are plenty of food premises which still need much visiting and attention, many of the local traders go far beyond the requirements of the Pood and Drugs Act in their sanitary provisions. Mobile traders are required to provide themselves with suitable washing facilities under the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, and their vehicles require to be checked from time to time. NUMBER AND TYPE OF FOOD PREMISES IN THE BOROUGH Bakers and Confectioners 17 Butchers 41 Club Canteens 16 Confectioners (Sweets) 100 Cafes, Restaurants, Dining Rooms and Snack Bars 71 Factory and Staff Canteens 51 Fishmongers 14 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 54 Grocers and Provisions and General Stores 117 Ice Cream Manufacturers 3 Public Houses and Off Licences 78 School Canteens 18 Total 580 ICE CREAM The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 1959 Throughout the year routine visits were paid to three ice cream manufacturing premises situated within the Borough for the purpose of taking samples of ice cream, ice cream lollies, etc. for analysis. Periodic checks of the recording and indicating thermometers on the manufacturing apparatus were made and these were at all times found to satisfy the requirements of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations. 27 Sampling During the year 77 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and the results obtained are as under:- Grade Ice Cream Ice Lollies Cream Lollies Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Doubtful Unsat isfactory Satisfactory Doubtful Unsat isfactory I 7 - - 2 - - - - - II 25 1 - - - - 2 - - III _ 7 _ _ _ _ _ 1 _ IV - - 31 - - - - - 1 Totals 32 8 31 2 - - 2 1 1 In addition, one sample of 1iquid vanilla essence was taken and found to be satisfactory, The above table has been compiled from results graded according to the following provisional grades set up by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, in relation to ice cream testing - Grade Classification Bacterial Count I Below 500 II 500-20,000 III 20,000 - 100,000 IV If count is over 100,000 and/or Faecal Coli present In the area served by Ealing Public Health Laboratory, the bacteriological count which is carried out and the results of which are tabulated here, is much more sensitive than the chemical tests used elsewhere. Although these chemical tests are sufficient for statutory requirements, the fact that Dr. Hughes of the Ealing Laboratory prefers the stricter control, is something for which the Borough citizens can be grateful, as manufacturers of ice cream who have factories in other areas or who send out their products sometimes find that ice cream passed elsewhere as suitable for consumption because of the results of the chemical test, are in a less happy position here because the bacteriological findings lead to investigations and requests for improvement of equipment or hygienic method. Registration of Premises Ice Cream The total number of premises registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Section 16, Food & Drugs Act, 1955, at the end of the year was as under:- Sale only 143 Manufacture and Sale 3 Storage only 1 Total 147 28 Preserved Foods The total number of premises registered in connection with the manufactur and/or preparation of preserved foods under Section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act 1955, at the end of the year was as under: - Sausage manufacture 11 Sausages and pickled meat 29 Cooking of ham and other meats 4 Total 44 69 of these registered premises were visited during the year. FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955 1,260 contraventions of the above-named Regulations have been found and 1,108 remedied from the date these Regulations came into operation up to the end of 1959. Details of these contraventions are as follows:- Contravention Found Remedied Articles/Equipment not kept clean 18 15 Articles/Equipment not in good order 45 33 Containers not protected from contamination 10 10 Food so placed as to involve risk of contamination 44 43 Food pliaced within 18n of ground and not adequately protected 10 8 Personal cleanliness not observed 13 3 Inadequate trapping of drain inlets 1 2 Water Closets not kept clean and in efficient order 52 50 Insufficient lighting and ventilation to water closets 14 10 Absence of 'Wash your hands' notices in water closets 77 74 Absence of suitable and sufficient wash-hand basins 112 89 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over wash-hand basins 103 83 Absence of soap, nail brushes, clean towels, etc. near wash-hand basins 79 67 Absence of or inadequate first aid materials 71 61 Absence of accommodation for clothing not worn during working hours 47 44 Absence of suitable and sufficient sinks for the washing of food and equipment 17 14 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over sink 27 23 Absence of soap, clean cloths etc. at sink 8 7 Absence of suitable and sufficient lighting in food rooms 17 15 Absence of suitable and sufficient ventilation in food rooms 29 20 Walls,floors, ceilings etc. not kept clean 94 91 Walls,floors, ceilings etc. not kept in good order 153 144 Covered receptacle for refuse not provided 40 38 Accumulations of refuse etc. 45 42 Specified foods not stored at prescribed temperature 1 1 Inadequate or defective drainage 67 60 Absence of proper storage of food 4 4 Animals on premises 5 5 Rat proofing required 44 39 Miscellaneous (beetles etc.) 13 13 Totals 1,260 1,108 No prosecutions were undertaken for contravention of these Regulations. 29 CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS 136 visits were made to catering establishments during the year and in 59 cases it was necessary to give written or verbal intimation that work was required. FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year, 25 cases concerning food alleged to be unsound were received in the Department. 16 cases were substantiated, the details of which are as follows*-.Complaint Action tak en Insects in bottle of orange drink Warning letter Insect in bread roll Warning letter Mouldy skinless sausages Warning letter Foreign matter in bread Warning letter Decomposed breast of chicken Court action - £10 fine and £5.5.Od. costs Mouldy pork pie Court action - £25 fine and £5.5.0d. costs Foreign matter in loaf of bread Warning letter Decomposed cut chicken portions Court action - £10 fine in each Decomposed cut chicken portions case and £5.5.0d. total costs Mouldy chocolate cup cake Warning letter Mouldy plum pudding Court action - £5 fine Condition of milk bottle Warning letter Condition of bottle of milk Warning letter Foreign matter in loaf of bread Warning letter Foreign body in piece of bread roll Warning letter Piece of glass in portion of bread Warning letter FOOD SAMPLING By the courtesy of the Chief Officer, Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, the following details of food sampling within the Borough are available; - Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 65 _ Butter 7 - Cakes 4 - Coffee 3 - Cream 5 - Drugs 9 - Fish and Fish Products 12 - Fruit, Fresh and Canned 6 - Ice Cream 26 - Liver 5 - Margarine 4 - Meat and Meat Products 23 - Preserves 6 - Spirits 7 - Vinegar and Non-Brewed Condiment 13 2 Miscellaneous 13 - Totals 208 2 30 The total number of samples taken was less than during the previous year i.e. 210 in 1959 compared with 241 in 1958. The number Qf unsatisfactory samples decreased from 18 in 1958 to 2 in 1959. The following are the details from the Chief Officer's report on the 2 unsatisfactory samples and the action taken - Vinegar and Non-Brented Condiment Non-brewed condiment, purported to be vinegar, was sold by a firm of greengrocers who were prosecuted for this offence. Vinegar is a natural product of the double fermentation of saccharine liquors and contains secondary products known as enzymes which confer upon vinegar its superior flavour and aroma. The artificial product is inferior both in taste and flavour and consists of a solution of acetic acid. Both products must contain at least 4 per cent of acetic acid. In this case the imitation product sold was also deficient in acetic acid to the extent of at least 21 per cent. A fine of £10. 0s. Od. was imposed with £5. 13s. Od. costs. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953 The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts is to ensure compliance with the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926. These Orders apply to the marking of the country of origin on imported foodstuffs, principally meat, apples, tomatoes, dried fruits, bacon, ham, poultry, butter and honey, upon sale and exposure for sale. Inspections were made at 106 premises of 291 displays of these foodstuffs, and no infringements were noted. Labelling of Food Order, 1953 This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address, or with the registered trade mark of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any), and in the case of a compounded food, with the names of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. Furthermore it controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 279 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 63 different premises to verify compliance with these Regulations. False and Misleading Descriptions Food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false and misleading statements and descriptions. No serious infringements were disclosed. Corrective action taken within the whole area of the County has equal effect within each County district, and work under this heading is combined with inspections made under the terms of the Merchandise Marks Acts and the Labelling of Food Order. A number of firms have labelled tins of Instant Coffee as "100% Pure Coffee". This product consists of the instantly soluble solids of coffee obtained by a process of dehydration. The insoluble portion of the bean is omitted. Representations have been made to have the description amended so that the product is not claimed to be whole coffee. Action has also been taken in connection with slimming claims as a result of taking lemon juice drinks. There is no clinical proof that the consumption of lemon juice will reduce weight, and the firms concerned have been requested to indicate that the drink is merely one suitable for inclusion in a slimming diet. 31 Other examples where corrective action was sought are set out as f611ows:- The percentage fat content marking on Continental Cheeses when set out as a percentage "I.D.M.changed to a comprehensible statement of "Pat on the dry matter". A Continental biscuit marked as "Cheese Pilled", which contained a filling only 20 per cent cheese. Such descriptions of Continental soft cheeses as "Super-Creme", "TripleCreme" and "Cream" etc. amended to indicate the true nature of the product, i.e. whole-milk cheese, cheese spread etc. Rice puddings marked as "Creamed Rice", fruit "syrups" labelled as fruit "juices", a "Seedless Pig Bar" which was found to contain crushed seeds, and cheese spreads described as "processed cheese". The claim that a particular breakfast cereal has twice as much honey as any other cereal was challenged. Some extravagant claims in respect of medical remedies were challenged and the advertisements withdrawn. Special Designated Milks During 1959, 3 samples of designated milks were taken, and compliance with statutory requirements was satisfactorily maintained. MEAT AND OTHER FOODS There are now no slaughterhouses operating in Brentford and Chiswick. FOOD CONDEMNED DURING THE YEAR 1959 Pruit and Vegetables 5 tons Meat and Bacon 1¼ tons Perishable Goods 4 cwts Tinned Goods 6,543 tins Unsound food is disposed of by incineration, tipping or for animal feeding. MILK During 1959, the following licences were issued under the Regulations mentioned - Milk (Special Designation)(Pasteurised & Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. Dealer's Licences 67 Supplementary Licences 18 Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1954. Dealer" s Licences 22 Supplementary Licences 9 BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 5 32 BRENTFORD MARKET Brentford Market is a large wholesale market for the sale of fruit, vegetables and flowers. It covers an area of approximately 11 acres and is under the control of the Borough Council. The Corporation employs a staff of 17 at the market and there are 450 holdings with 150 tenants. On busy days roughly 1,500 vehicles pass through the market. Modern sanitary conveniences are provided on the West side of the market and free washing facilities are available at this and other conveniences situated in the market. The Public Health Inspectors pay frequent visits to the market to confirm the maintenance of good sanitation and the Corporation employ the services of a firm of pest exterminators who pay visits to the market every six weeks to ensure that it is kept free from rodent infestation. Situated in the market are also wholesalers who deal in groceries, tinned foods, etc., and in this connection the Public Health Inspectors visit for the condemnation of such goods as are reckoned to be unfit for human consumption. -33- HEALTH EDUCATION Work on Health Education of the public continued throughout the year. Posters, handbills, window stickers and counter cards particularly designed to emphasise safety in the home and food hygiene, were distributed and leaflets on various health subjects were displayed on Public Library counters and in the Council Offices for free issue to anyone who cared to pick them up. As part ofaCivic Week Exhibition held in the Town Hall in July, a Public Health Department stand was erected, draped and equipped, and manned by members of the staff of the Department, who gave much of their spare time freely for this purpose. Exhibits on many health subjects were on display, the main emphasis being on Rodent Control, Atmospheric Pollution, Pood Hygiene and methods of Pood Contamination, and Unfit Housing which linked up with the exhibits on Housing Redevelopment in the Borough Engineer's section of the Exhibition. Although the number of people who came to the Town Hall to see the exhibition was not very great, those who attended were able to ask for and obtain information on matters of Public Health from the Departmental representative on the stand, and all this was useful Health Education. In order to help those people who needed information on suitable appliances and suitable fuel for dwellings due to be included in the first Smoke Control Area in the Borough, the North Thames Gas Board and the Coal Utilisation Council sent their display vans into the Borough for a period, in which various types of smokeless fire could be seen burning. Many of the general public would first visit these vans and then come to the Department for further advice and information. In addition, an old-fashioned fire in the Departmental offices was replaced by an approved standard type grate with gas ignition, so that enquirers could be shown the operation of such a fire and could estimate for themselves how it would compare in comfort and appearance with their existing methods of heating. This grate was also useful for comparing the suitability of the various old and new types of smokeless fuel which would be available for purchase once the Smoke Control Areas were defined and declared. 34 WELFARE OLD PEOPLE During 1959, 33 cases of old people in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. No patient was found to be in such conditions as to require statutory action under the National Assistance Act. Details of the 33 cases are as follows:- Removed to hospital 6 Removed to Old People1 s Homes 3 Left District 2 Remained at home:- (a) meals on wheels provided 6 (b) with Home Help 2 (c) awaiting admission to a Home 1 (d) housing repairs carried out and/or cleanliness improved 1 (e) no help required 7 (f) all help refused 3 Died at home 2 During the year a total of 333 aged persons or aged chronic sick persons in the Borough received help from the Home Help Service, and the Home Nurses dealt with 533 old people out of a total of 832 cases. These figures compare with 306 aged persons receiving help from the Home Help Service in 1958 and 586 old persons being visited by the Nurses out of a total of 959 cases. Information supplied by the County Welfare Officer shows that during the year 30 old people from the Borough were admitted to Old People's Homes through the County Welfare Department, including three persons previously brought to our notice in 1958. Thfe County Council has the duty, under the National Assistance Act, 1948 of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them, and it does this by admission to its own Homes or by meeting the cost of maintenance in Homes administered by registered Voluntary Organisations. The County Council* s Welfare Department is responsible for the County Homes and one such Home is situated in the Borough. Chiropody A service was maintained throughout the year by the Middlesex County. Council whereby old people could have their foot defects treated at reduced cost or free of charge Figures of the numbers taking advantage of this Service can be found on page 64. Old Folks Friendship Club This is a specially built club house opened in April, 1955, for the use as a social and recreational centre of old age pensioners living in Brentford and 35 Chiswick. The club is open Monday to Friday from 1-5 p.m. and there is an organiser in attendance. The old people are enrolled as members at their first attendance, membership costs only one penny per week, and there are 250 names on the register. The members can visit every day, if they wish, for rest room or reading room facilities, or just to meet their friends and talk, but many social occasions are provided for them in the way of concerts, whist drives, etc. A television set is installed in the lounge, and a radiogram in the concert hall. Light refreshments are available. This club also arranges summer outings (of which there were three in 1959) and an annual Christmas party. In 1959 a free invitation for a theatre visit was accepted by a large number of members and there were some additional facilities for entertainment at a cheap price arranged during the Christmas season. Through this club the members are also able to obtain information about the special services at reduced rates which are available within the Borough for them, such as laundry, shoe repairs and hairdressing, and they can be given advice on any difficulties that occur in their private lives. Members living alone are encouraged to make use of the S.O.S. card scheme, and have the card ready and completed with personal details for window display should an emergency occur. This is the only club premises open daily for the use of old age pensioners but there are other clubs meeting in different parts of the Borough once a week to which mobile old age pensioners become attached as members, for social and recreational purposes. Brentford Old Folks Social Club This club meets every Wednesday 1.30 p.m. - 5 p.m. and has 150 members. The meetings are social with periodic visiting entertainers. There are 3 or 4 summer outings, a free tea once per month and two annual parties. Old Age Pensions Association (Brentford Branch) This association has a membership of 65 with an average attendance of about 50 at each weekly meeting which is of a social nature. Two free outings per year, annual tea and a Christmas dinner are held. Old Age Pensions Association (Chiswick Branch) This association has a membership of 140, and meets weekly for social purposes with guest entertainers. A free annual outing and Christmas Tea Party are held. Other Societies Several of the societies whose functions are classified under WelfareGeneral contribute to a very considerable extent to the Welfare of the Elderly, i.e. the British Red Cross Association, the St.John Ambulance Brigade, the Blind Club, the Club for the Hard of Hearing, the Chiswick Mission (which maintains two houses in Chiswick in which aged persons can rent rooms at a nominal figure i.e. 8/- to 10/- per week inclusive of gas and electricity for cooking and lighting and whose Superintendent does much visiting amongst old people) and the two Philanthropic Societies. Slipper Baths Under the scheme for the provision at the reduced rates (2d. per bath) of slipper baths for old people at the Public Baths Establishments, 2,697 baths were taken in Chiswick and 1,005 in Brentford. The figure for Chiswick was slightly greater but that for Brentford increased by nearly 40% over the figure in 1958. 36 Meals on Wheels The provision of a hot dinner once a day for an old person living alone may make all the difference between health and malnutrition. The new meals service operated by the Brentford and Chiswick Welfare Organisation which is subsidised by Brentford and Chiswick Borough Council, developed rapidly during 1959. For most of the year in order to keep down the waiting list for this service, the Meals Van, originally planned to convey 40 - 50 meals a day, was actually carrying round 55 - 65. This meant that the meals were delivered over a somewhat protracted lunch hour as the delivery required three hours of fast continuous service, and was also making excessively heavy demands on the very willing driver and helper. It was early realised that a second van would be required, and by the end of the year it was hoped that this double service would be available early in 1960. 150 elderly persons obtained meals from this service during 1959, and 12,898 meals were delivered during the year. In addition to this meals service, the Invalid Meals for London continued to supply certain people in the Borough with daily meals throughout the year. Laundry for the Incontinent Aged The scheme for the provision of laundry facilities for the incontinent aged, started in the autumn of 1956, was carried on throughout the year. Old people in need of this service were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff from various sources, then arrangements were made for the Department's van to call each week to collect the soiled linen, deliver it to Spring Grove Laundry, and to transport the clean linen back again to the home of the old person. No charge was made for the service but for each case a certificate was submitted to the Public Health Committee. During the year eleven old persons had been recommended for, and obtained this service. Home Safety The North Thames Gas Board who in 1956 offered a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone, continued to arrange for inspections during the year. The reason for this was in order to reduce the risk of gas poisoning, a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer was to include free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances. GENERAL The District Superintendent of the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the Divisional Director of the British Red Cross Society have kindly supplied information concerning their welfare work in the Borough. St. John Ambulance Brigade There are 4 Divisions of St. John Ambulance Brigade in this Borough.

This Division covers duties at the Brentford Football Ground, at various Sports Meetings and cricket matches. They supply an Instructor for First Aid and organise St. John Ambulance Association classes for the local Civil Defence Corps and they also instruct in First Aid certain of the local Scout troops. They send attendants to Old People's gatherings and outings. Transport by motor ambulance is provided for several members of the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship to their monthly social gatherings. Members of this Division attended to 120 cases whilst on public duty and 600 cases off duty.

In addition, there is a flourishing Junior Red Cross Unit at Chiswick, some of whose members help at the local hospitals. 38 WELFARE OF THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED The County Council is responsible, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, for the provision of welfare services for the blind and partially-sighted. There are resident in the Borough 96 blind and 32 partially-sighted persons. 14 of these are in full-time employment; 1 is in a Workshop for the Blind and 3 are Home Workers, receiving augmentation and supplementation of earnings from the County Council. The remainder are not available for, or are not capable of, training or employment, owing to age or infirmity or for some other reason. There are also 5 partially-sighted and 6 blind children under the age of 16 years, 7 of whom are at Special Schools. In addition 1 blind person and 1 partially-sighted person between the ages of 16 and 20 are receiving further education and 2 blind persons are in training. The County Council provides a Home Teaching service for the visitation of blind and partially-sighted people in their own homes, the object of which is to enable partially-sighted and blind people to lead as full and active lives as their handicap allows. The duties of the Home Teachers include advising blind and partially-sighted persons on all problems relating to their welfare and of all the available social services, assisting them in overcoming the effects of their disabilities, giving instruction in Braille and Moon systems of raised type, in handcrafts, and, where appropriate, in the deaf-blind manual alphabet. A handcraft class is held fortnightly at Christ Church Hall, Turnhajn Green. A County Council Old Time Dancing Class for the Blind is held weekly in Ealing and a number of blind residents in the Borough attend. The County Council works in close co-operation with Voluntary Organisations, including (a) The Middlesex Association for the Blind, who maintain a Holiday Home at Littlehampton, two Residential Homes for the Blind and assist individual necessitous blind persons and (b) The Social Club for the Blind which meets fortnightly at Christ Church Hall. This Club is maintained and managed by a voluntary Committee. Attendance ranges from 30 to 45 at each meeting. The meeting is a social gathering with occasional talks, and more usually entertainment. A Christmas dinner, a Spring Buffet Supper, and a Summer Excursion to the sea are arranged. Members are sent for holidays at reduced prices to two caravans at Lancing, Sussex provided by public subscription from the citizens of Brentford and Chiswick and maintained by Middlesex County Council. The British Wireless for the Blind Fund supplies wireless sets to registered blind persons through the County Council which maintains all sets for blind and partially-sighted persons. Other services provided directly by the County Council or through a Registered agency, include facilities for the placement of blind persons in employment, courses of residential rehabilitation, training courses for mothers with babies, the supply of embossed literature, special equipment and handcraft materials, assistance in the disposal of handcrafts, and assisted holidays for those in need. WELFARE OF HANDICAPPED PERSONS OTHER THAN BLIND Schemes for the welfare of handicapped persons other than blind and partially sighted are operated by the County Council's Welfare Department under the National Assistance Act, 1948; these cover the deaf and dumb and hard of hearing, and other persons who are substantially and permanently handicapped by crippling diseases or congenital deformity. 39 The County Council's Welfare Department has provided two Welfare Visitors for persons in the Borough who are suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps other than those already mentioned and they work under the direction of the Area Welfare Officer. They visit such persons in their own homes with a view to assisting them to obtain from statutory or voluntary sources (or both) facilities, appliances, etc., which may benefit them. The help afforded may for example enable the disabled person to take part in social activities, choral classes, dancing classes, attend handcraft classes, obtain aneeded holiday, or by provision of ramps for mechanical chairs, handrails, lifting hoists and the like, give a previously non-existent measure of mobility to a person who was chair-bound or house-bound. Where the circumstances require it adaptations to houses, including the provision of downstairs toilet facilities, may be undertaken. Advice and guidance regarding personal problems are given, and membership of a voluntary organisation catering for a particular handicap is facilitated. A Homework Organiser has been appointed and some handicapped persons who are unable to obtain employment in open industry but who are suitable for a certain amount of light work are provided with this on a part-time basis at a Work Centre or at home. Services to the deaf and dumb and the hard of hearing are provided by appropriate voluntary organisations, to whom the County Council makes grants in aid. The Brentford and Chiswick Group of the Middlesex and Surrey League for the Hard of Hearing, meets every Friday evening at Chiswick Library and Brentford Baths annexe alternately. The attendance is 12 - 15 members weekly. There are social meetings, talks and discussions, outings and visits to other groups in the County. The Club has elected a Welfare Officer to visit sick and housebound members. A Club for the Physically Handicapped is maintained by Chiswick Mission (a Branch of The Shaftesbury Society). The disablements are various and transport is arranged by the Rotary Club for those who cannot travel easily. The Club meets once a month for social purposes, the membership is 20 and the average attendance 15. The Multiple Sclerosis Society maintains a Branch, known as the West London Branch, which has members from this Borough. Social meetings, entertainments, and the arrangement of, and help with, holidays for members is carried out. WELFARE - RELIEF OF DISTRESS Brentford Philanthropic Society and Chiswick Philanthropic Society are charitable associations which exist to give help to any in need who are as yet outside of the many statutory provisions for Welfare. A request for help is followed by a visit from a representative of the Society and gifts of coal, extra comforts, special foods, or help with payment for holidays are some of the many provisions which have been made. The Brentford Society also provided in 1959, a free holiday for 80 old age pensioners and distributed a cash gift of 7/6 to old folk at Christmas and the Chiswick Society took 81 elderly residents to the seaside for the day and gave a cash gift of 15/- at Christmas to 170 needy elderly people. Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Services briefly referred to in this Report should apply to the Area Welfare Officer, Mr. J.F. Cronk, at the Local County Offices, Great West Road, Brentford. 40 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION During 1959, there were two stations for the measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere by the volumetric method. The sites were respectively Brentford Baths and a room on the second floor of a building adjacent to the Town Hall. In addition, two deposit gauges, one at the Metropolitan Water Board Works, Kew Bridge, and the other in Chiswick House Grounds, were used for the measurement of grit deposits from the atmosphere. Each month reports of recordings and other relevant particulars were submitted to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, for comparison with the rest of the country, and assistance was available from the officers of the Fuel Research Station when special problems arose concerning readings of results or the breakdown of equipment. flulletins from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research were received regularly and studied in the Public Health Department so that results could be compared with those in other areas. A brief summary of the year' s recordings is to be found in tables XII and XIII at the end of the book, and in graphs "C" and "E" which have been prepared from these figures. Graph "D" shows the monthly rise and fall in the pollution figures for Brentford and Chiswick, also Leeds, Central London and Lerwick. These latter places have been chosen in order to illustrate the varying amounts of pollution from a virtually smokeless atmosphere, i.e. Lerwick to an industrial area, i.e. Leeds. During the year, 123 visits or observations were made in connection with cases in which it was alleged or suspected that atmospheric pollution might be taking place. Work was carried out where necessary, and advice on stoking methods given occasionally. An interesting observation from the figures for smoke and stilphur dioxide measured by the volumetric method at the two sites already mentioned is that consistently, throughout the year, the figures for Chiswick were worse than those for Brentford. The deposit gauge figures however are variable, and unfortunately, not complete, but although the Brentford deposit gauge is in direct line windward of the Brentford Gas Works, yet at the latter end of the year, the Chiswick findings, from the middle of an open space, are again worse. If there is no error in these figures, they suggest that pollution is coming across the river into Chiswick. It will be interesting to note the effect of the operation of a Smoke Control Area, as the Chiswick deposit gauge (in Chiswick House Grounds) is within the area of the first one. Clean Air Act, 1956 During the year under review the Council made an Order establishing a Smoke Control Area. The area chosen was in Chiswick and comprised of 300 acres and bounded by Park Road (east side), from the junction of the Cromwell Road Extension to Burlington Lane and thence from Burlington Lane eastward on the north side of the Southern Region Railway line to the River Thames boundary thence northwards to the northern boundary of Edensor Gardens, along the south side of Corney Road, across Burlington Lane, along the northern perimeter of Chiswick House Grounds to the junction with the Cromwell Road Extension. The Order was subsequently confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and was due to come into operation on 1st May, 1960. During the year the Council also submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government its proposals for creating further Smoke Control Areas in the next five years. These proposals were submitted in accordance with Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular 5/5-9. 41 The second area to be surveyed extends from south of the railway line from Barnes Bridge to the railway line north of Thames Road railway bridge and consists of approximately 288 acres. Situated in this area, which immediately adjoins the No. 1 Area, are some 1,150 domestic premises, 20 commercial and industrial properties and 11 miscellaneous buildings. 582 visits and re-visits were made during the year in connection with Smoke Control Areas. Brentford Gas Works In July, 1959, the Council asked for a further report on the emission of smoke and grit from the above named Works. Observations were kept by the Public Health Inspectors and in August, 1959, the Alkali etc. Works Inspector of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government visited the Works. The following report was submitted to the Council - "At the present time only three quarters of the retorts, which carbonise coal, are in operation, and the make of gas is less than 40% of the Winter load. The charging schedule of the retorts in operation has been carried out at regular intervals throughout the day and night. In addition, further enclosure of the high level coke hoppers has been carried out with the object of reducing escape of grit, and a second crane is soon to be installed to minimise the unloading of coal to the elevated coke bunkers. Prom the observations kept by the Public Health Inspectors, the amount of emission both early in the morning and during the day time, does not appear to have been excessive. With regard to the suggestion that smoke is emitted during the night time, it may well be that the white plume of steam from the quenching towers, could be mistaken in the darker hours for smoke." -42- GRAPH "C" VARIATION IN AVERAGE MONTHLY CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE IN BRENTFORD AND CHISWICK DURING 1959 43 GRAPH "D" COMPARISON OF CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AT BRENTFORD, CHISWICK, CENTRAL LONDON, LEEDS AND LERWICK 44 GRAPH "E" Monthly Deposits of Water Soluble and Water Insoluble Matter in Brentford and Chiswick during 1959 45 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Inspections The total number of inspections and re-inspections made during the year was 5,516 and the following is a summary of these inspections. Inspections Re- inspections Atmospheric Pollution Stations 313 1 Accumulations of refuse 86 120 Complaints-condition of house 402 974 Caravans, house-boats, etc 6 17 Catering Establishments 32 104 Drainage works 155 323 Factories-"With mechanical power 37 17 Factories-without mechanical power 4 - Food premises (excluding catering establishments) 61 173 Food premises-inspection of unsound food 184 36 Houses-Housing Acts 408 361 Houses-Re-housing - - Houses-Overcrowding 48 28 Ice Cream Vendors 32 1 Infectious disease 313 49 Milk Vendors 22 6 Offensive odours 27 14 Outworkers 29 - Rats and Mice 115 81 Shop-shops Act inspections 133 12 Smoke observations 101 22 Vermin, insect pests etc 90 27 Miscellaneous 210 22 OldPeople (including laundry service) 310 10 3,118 2,398 There was a great increase in the number of inspections and re-inspections required during the year, 521 and 373 respectively. The major increases were in housing inspections - for evidence of unfitness, infectious disease visits and the tracing of contacts of infectious cases, Shops Act inspections, and visits to Old People in need. It will be realised that the classification of a visit under one heading is arbitrary so that, for example, a visit paid for the purpose of confirming that due attention is being paid to the requirements of the Shops Act is likely to be used by the Inspector at the same time for the checking of sanitation, the hygienic handling of food, and the giving of Health Education. Action taken other than Housing Act, 1957 Cautionary or Intimation Notices served 311 Statutory Notices issued (under Public Health Acts) 49 Number of summonses served 7 46 The following list shows the number of defects and other nuisances remedied during the year as a result of notices served:- Brickwork, repaired 3 Choked drains, unstopped 34 Chimney stacks and flues, repaired and made good 2 Ceilings, repaired and made good 72 Doors and Frames, repaired 22 Dustbins, supplied 9 Dampness in walls, remedied 146 Fresh air inlets and interceptor caps etc., provided 49 Firegrates, cooking stoves, repaired or renewed 11 Floors, joists and staircases, repaired or renewed 55 Gutterings, repaired or renewed or cleaned out 20 Inspection covers and frames renewed 23 Leaky roofs and skylights repaired 43 Plaster to walls, repaired and made good 76 Rainwater pipes, repaired or renewed 19 Soil pipe ventilators, repaired or renewed 18 Sinks replaced 10 Seats to W.C.s repaired or renewed 29 Water waste preventors, repaired or renewed 26 Walls and ceilings, cleansed or redecorated 7 Waste pipes, repaired or renewed 20 Window frames, sash cords, sills, repaired or renewed 160 W.C.

Enquiries - Outstanding Sanitary Notices During the year 1,310 letters were received from other Departments enquiring whether there were any outstanding sanitary notices with respect to certain properties in the district. The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. SCHOOL SANITATION In previous Annual Reports reference has been made to the sanitary facilities provided for schools in the borough. During the year under review, improved sanitation has been provided in two of the schools of the borough, details of which are as follows - Chiswick County Grammar Boys" School - Completion of provision of washrooms and changing rooms in the new extension. 30 new washbasins installed. Belmont School - Provision of one additional washbasin in school meals canteen. WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICES The whole of the district is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board mains. There is one well still in use in the Borough at Green" s Boathouse, Riverside Lands. This well is used for washing purposes only, drinking water is obtained direct from mains. The mains water supply is satisfactory both in quality and quantity and reports of the bacteriological and chemical analyses carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board are issued from time to time. The Board also supplies each month a report on the state of purity of the water supply, at its sources and after chlorination. REFUSE COLLECTION Refuse is collected once per week from each house in the Borough and is disposed of by collecting freighters to a Controlled Tip outside the Borough. 48 HOUSING RENT ACT, 1957 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (1) Number of applications for certificates 7 (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates - (3) Number of decisions to issue certificates 7 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 6 (b) in respect of all defects 1 (4) Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 5 (5) Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule - (6) Number of Certificates issued 1 Applications for Cancellation of Certificates (7) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 4 (8) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 1 (9) Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants, objection - (10) Certificates cancelled by Local Authority 1 HOUSING (FINANCIAL PROVISIONS) ACT, 1958 HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959 Number of Grants for Improvements and Conversions 45 HOUSING ACT 1957 Considerable work was carried out during the year in connection with the large programme of clearance of unfit houses in the Borough with the re-housing of the occupants, with the demolition of the properties and the redevelopment of the cleared areas.

These 4 houses were certified by the Medical Officer of Health as being unfit for human habitation and that the best method of dealing with same was for them to be demolished. The Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed the Council's action on the 18th November, 1959.

It should be noted that the Borough Council's figures include a number of dwellings on the Syon Estate, Isleworth, which is in the adjoining Borough of Heston and Isleworth. Conversion of Council Houses In December, 1957, a plan was prepared for the conversion of 10 semidetached houses and 16 end houses in larger blocks in Lionel Road, and 6 houses in Whitestile Road. The scheme was for the conversion of these 32 premises into flats to double the amount of housing accommodation available on these sites. In 1959, fifteen more of these conversions were completed, five having been done during the previous year. In addition, two other properties, purchased by the Council, were similarly converted into two flats each. Overcrowding Thirty cases of statutory overcrowding were brought to the notice of the Department and were considered by the Housing Committee during 1959. It will be seen from the Housing Statistics on page 56 that twelve cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year. Overcrowding is relieved in various ways, by private arrangements made by the families concerned, by Council re-housing, or by Council nomination under the Industrial Selection Scheme for housing in New Towns. DISINFECTION Premises disinfected Ordinary notifiable diseases 60 Tuberculosis 2 Cancer 3 Premises treated for vermin 40 Premises treated for other pests (wasps, moths, ants and beetles) 22 Routine disinfection of blankets, bedding etc. were carried out on the premises in the above table as required. In addition, certain articles of clothing, 7 parcels of clothing destined for countries abroad, and when necessary, books for both public and private libraries, were disinfected on the Public Health Department premises. In 1959, anew disinfector of the chemical vaporizer type was purchased by the Council for the Department and installed on the premises. This machine is capable of dealing with the majority of the items which require to be disinfected or disinfested other than large articles such as interior sprung mattresses or furniture. An arrangement is in force whereby the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee undertakes to carry out emergency disinfection of smallpoxinfected clothing and bedding on demand. 57 MISCELLANEOUS RODENT CONTROL During the year 3,303 primary visits and re-visits were made by the Rodent Operatives to premises in the district in connection with rodent disinfestation. The number of premises where treatment was carried out is as follows: - Private Houses 371 Factories 23 Shops 22 Schools 10 None of these infestations were severe enough to be classed as major infestations. In addition to the above, a maintenance treatment to the sewers was carried out during April, 1959, and 31 manholes were found to be infested. The work of Rodent Control is carried out under the supervision of the Chief Public Health Inspector by two Rodent Operatives who have the assistance of a labourer during such time as the sewers are being treated. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act for the regulation of the sale of pet animals requires all premises in which animals are sold for pets to be licenced by the local authority. Two licences were issued during the year. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Three premises in the Borough are registered for the purpose of the above Act, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 2 thereof. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Seven establishments were inspected under this heading and all were found to be satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Purpose No, of Licences Massage only - Chiropody only 3 Massage and Chiropody - Massage, Chiropody and Electrical Treatment Massage and Electrical Treatment 2 Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 2 FREE WASHING FACILITIES IN PUBLIC CONVENIENCES Facilities for free hand washing are available in the Kew Bridge both "Ladies" and "Men "s", High Road "Men"s" and Turnham Green "Ladies" Public Conveniences, paper towels and liquid soap in tilting dispensers being available in each. In addition a wash hand basin is provided in the "Ladies" convenience in Linden Gardens. During the year 1959, 10,500 paper towels were issued and, in addition, those who preferred linen hand towels and tablet soap were able to hire these at a cost of 3d. In the same conveniences 5,193 of these towels were also used. 58 There are no free washing facilities available at the Edensor Road "Ladies" and Men"s" nor at the Turnham Green "Men" s" conveniences. In one other convenience in the Borough - Market Place "Men's and Ladies", free washing facilities are not available as there is no longer an attendant but it is still kept open weekdays and Sundays from 7.0 a.m. to 8.0 p.m. pending demolition. This convenience is planned to be demolished in connection with the plan for the redevelopment of the High Street (east of the Courthouse). RIVER POLLUTION Reports continued to be received every three months from the Officers of Middlesex County Council regarding the condition of the River Brent. Samples were taken at points along the stream from Wembley to Brentford High Street; the two sampling points in the Borough being at Gallows Bridge and Brentford High Street. The results of sampling in 1959 were not good, there is evidence of increasing pollution from the higher reaches, and also the amount of oil being permitted to enter the river is visibly increasing. There seems little doubt that the increasing substitution of mechanical tugs for horses and the increasing number of oil driven barges is having a very harmful effect on the River. No action was required to be taken against persons using the River Brent for unauthorised discharge of sewage or trade effluents during the year. STREET TRADING Certain prescribed areas in the district were allocated for street trading purposes, and were frequently visited to ensure that they were being maintained in good condition and in accordance with the Bye-laws. Visits were also paid to the premises of street hawkers who deal in foodstuffs. CANAL BOATS Number of boats on register:- Motor propelled boats 89 Other boats 406 MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF COUNCIL STAFF During 1959, 44 medical examinations of candidates for Council employment and one special examination for retirement on grounds of permanent ill-health were carried out. 59 NUCLEAR RADIATION No particular difficulty arose during the year with regard to radioactivity. Reports are now being sent regularly from the Metropolitan Water Board, as part of their information on the state of the water supply of London and its environs, concerning the sampling being done by their officers of the radiation content of the water going into supply. In these reports it is always stated that current information has been obtained from the Atomic Energy Authority on the radiation state of the outfalls from those nuclear reactors situated near the River Thames. 60 HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee Brentford Hospital, Chiswick Maternity Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Clayponds Wing (formerly Clayponds Hospital) are situated within the Borough and are administered by the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee under the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946.
