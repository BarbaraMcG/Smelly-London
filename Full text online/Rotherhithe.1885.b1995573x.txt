Leases o? houses completed upon the Estate have been granted as follows, viz.:—No. 13, Redriff-terrace, Plaistow-road, to Mr. Frederick John Ovenden, for 81 years from 24th December, 1884, at a rental of £4 10s. per annum; No. 8, RedrifF-terrace, to Mr. George Major Cripps, for 81 years from 24th December, 1884, at a rental of £4 15s. per annum; No. 12, RcdrifF-terrace, to Mr. Sidney Richard Suffield, for 81 years from 24th December, 1884, at a rental of £4 10s. per annum; No. 4, RedrifFterrace, to Mr. Frank Hamshere, for 81 years from 24th December, 1884, at a rental of £4 4s. per annum. On the 3rd November, 1885, the Vestry, upon the report of the Charity Estates Committee, who had visited the Plaistow Charity Estate, passed resolutions as follows, viz.:— "Resolved, that the Vestry lease to Mr. William Stotesbury, not only the house and land (No. 13, RedrifF-terrace, Plaistow) coloured red and green in the plan produced, but also the strip on the south side marked on the said plan " Old Ditch filled in," and also that the Surveyor be instructed to colour the said strip green, on the said plan." "Resolved, that the Vestry require that the boundary line on the south side of the Estate at Plaistow be set out the whole length at 3 feet from the outside of the Hedge on the site of the old ditch, and as far as possible, according to the plan of the Estate dated 1817, and notices be served upon the owners of the adjoining property, requiring I hem to set back the fences where they encroach upon the Charity Estate. The Committee having reported they had inspected the boundary on the north side ol the Plaistow Estate, and that they considered the fences of the houses on the adjoining estate had been set out at a fair line, a space being left between the fences and the old hedge there, it was "Resolved that the same be approved." Baths and Wash-houses. At a meeting of the Vestry held on the 3rd November, 1885, Messrs. Ralph Westall Walker and 1 homas William Clarke were re-elected Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, to carry out the provisions of the Baths and Wash-houses Acts in this parish, in conjunction with Messrs. Francis John Bisley, John Bulmer, Edward James Talbot, Samuel Brownfield, and Lawrence Stevens. At the same meeting of the Vestry, Messrs. Henry Lovell Bartlett and George Mabbs were re-elected Auditors of the accounts of the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses for the ensuing year. 21 Improvements. The Metropolitan Hoard of Works having formed a Wicket Gate entrance to Southwark Park from Dilston-grove, the Vestry found, that in order to obtain a communication therefrom through to Abbeyfield-road (urged by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood), it was requisite to make a passage-way on the site of one of the houses in the said road; negotiations were thereupon entered into with the Freeholder (Mrs. Carr Gomm,) and with the Leaseholders of the house, No. 09, Abbeyfield-road, when arrangements were made for the purchase of the property bv the Vestrv, upon the following terms, viz.:— For the Freehold of the site £120 0 0 For the Leasehold Interest £400 0 0 Total £520 0 0 The Metropolitan Board of Works, on the application of the Vestry, agreed to contribute the sum of £260 towards the cost of the purchase of the said premises, and to lend the Vestry on Mortgage the sum of £250 on further account of such cost, to be repaid by thirty consequtive annual instalments. The purchase of the property was then completed, the house No. 69 Abbeyfield-road taken down and a passage-way carried out on the site. The said passage way was formally opened to the public by John Tolhurst Esq., at a Special Meeting of the Vestry and Parishioners held on the spot, on the 5th September, 1885. A Memorial from certain ratepayers of this parish in favour of setting back the "Hoval Oak" p.h., and two or three adjoining shops at the junction of Union lload and Deptford Lower Road, having been received by the Vestry, in September, 1885, the Vestry forwarded the Memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works. In December, 1885, a reply was received from that Board, stating that, although the setting back of the buildings referred to would doubtless be an improvement, the advantages of it would be purely local, and it is therefore one which should be undertaken by the Vestry, and not by the Board at the cost of the Metropolis at large. The Vestry caused a letter to be addressed to the Metropolitan Board of Works as follow3, viz.:— The Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Suhkey. Offices—Deptford Lower Road, S.E. 15th December, 1885. Sir, I am directed by the Vestry to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., with reference to the suggested improvement, by setting back the buildings at the junction of Union-road and Deptford Lower-road, and stating that the Metropolitan Board of Works regard the matter as one of purely local interest, and therefore to be undertaken by the Vestry and not by the Board at the 22 cost of the Metropolis at large. I am to state that the Vestry regret the Board should have arrived at this decision, inasmuch as they consider that in order to render the improvements carried out under the Acts of 1877 and 1882 perfect, and to open a direct communication between London Bridge and Woolwich, as originallv contemplated it is necessary that the roadway at this corner should be widened. The Vestry therefore trust that in this view of the matter, the Metropolitan Board of Works will reconsider their determination, and accede to the request of the Memorialists. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, To the Clerk, Clerk to the Vestry. The Metropolitan Board of Works. To which the following reply was received: Metropolitan Board of Works, Spring Gardens, S.W. 10th March, 1886. Sir, The Board has had under consideration your letter of 15th December last, expressing the regret of the Vestry of Rotherhithe at the Board's decision, that the setting back of the buildings at the junction of Union-road and Deptford Lower-road, is not an improvement which should be carried out at the cost of the Metropolis at large, and asking the Board for the reasons stated in the letter to reconsider its determination. In reply, I have been directed to state for the information of the Vestry, that the Board having again given its best attention to the matter, is unable to depart from its previous decision, that the improvement is not one which should be carried out at the cost of the Metropolis at large. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) J. E. WAKEFIELD, 1 o the Clerk of Clerk to the Board. The Vestry of Rotherhithe. In November, 1885, the Vestrv presented a Memorial to the Metropolitan Board ol Works, as follows:— To the Honourable the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the County of Surrey. Sheweth, That your Memorialists are of opinion that increased means of communication between the South Eastern and North Eastern districts of the Metrop. oil are urgently required and that such communication should be by means of a low level free Bridge, to be ericted across the River Iliames, either in continuation of the Deptford Lower-road in your Memorialists' parish, or at some other point not far distant therefrom. v 23 That your Memorialists disapprove of the proposal to construct a Tunnel under the Thames, at an angle from the Commercial-road to this parish, believing1 that the requirements of the Eastern and South Eastern portions of the Metropolis would not thereby be satisfactorily provided for, but that such Tunnel would he very inconvenient for the passage of the heavy timber traffic from the Surrey Commercial Docks to the opposite side of the river. Your Memorialists therefore pray that your Honourable Board will be pleased to take into your favourable consideration the propriety of constructing a low-level Bridge over the River Thames, either in continuation of the Deptford Lower-road, or at such other point within your Memorialists' parish as your Honourable Board may consider more suitable, and Your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. Sealed by order of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, (Seal of Vestry) this 27th November, 1885. (Signed) JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. The Memorial was referred by the Metropolitan Board of Works to their Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration. In June, 1885, on the application of the Remembrancer of the Corporation of the City of London, the Vestry presented a Petition to the House of Lords in support of the London Tower Bridge Bill, and appointed the following gentlemen to give evidence before the Committee of the House of Lords in favour of the scheme, viz.: Messrs. John Bulmer, Robert Foottit, Francis John Bisley, Henry Hayward and Ralph Westall Walker. Miscellaneous. A communication dated 5th June, 1885, was received from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works, stating that the Board had approved a plan submitted by Messrs. Stock, Page and Stock for the formation of a new road out of Bracton-road, Rotherhithe, to be named "Eugenia Road," S.E. (in continuation) upon the usual conditions. In September, 1885, the Vestry in cooperation with the Vestry of St. Pancras and other Vestrids and District Boards in the Metropolis, appointed delegates to attend a conference of the representatives of the Metropolitan Local Boards, on the subject of the Management and Expenditure of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, viz.: Messrs. Henry Hayward, Francis John Bisley and Lawrence Stevens, those gentlemen attended a conference of the delegates at the Mansion House, London, on the 19th October, 1885, and reported to the Vestry that a resolution had been passed at the meeting as follows, viz.: "That in the opinion of this meeting, the evidence taken by the Local (Jovern"ment Board Inspectors, with reference to the expenditure, &c., at the Eastern "(Homerton) Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, discloses a lack of efficient "control over the affairs of the Hospital, a loose and careless mode of conducting the 24 "the business of the establishment and an extravagant outlay of public moneys, and "necessitates a searching enquiry, not only into the management and expenditure of "this Hospital, but also the other establishments of the Hoard, and the affairs of the "Board generallv; and that it is expedient such enquiry should be conducted by a "Parliamentary Committee or a Royal Commission. The Vestrv resolved to support the said resolution of the delegates for an enquiry into the matters referred to therein. The Report of the Special Committee of the City of London proposing the division of the Metropolis into Ten Municipalities, of which the City of London would form one for the Local Government thereof, having been fully considered by the Vestry at a Special Meeting held on the 8th December, 1885, a resolution was passed as follows, viz.:— "Resolved, that this Vestry approve of the general principle of the scheme "promoted by the Corporation of the City of London, for the Local Government of "the Metropolis, but are of opinion that the areas of the proposed Municipalities "should be extended, so as to diminish the number as far as possible." A copy of the resolution was forwarded to the Corporation of the City of London. In January, 1886, the Vestry having had under consideration a communication received from the Metropolitan Board of Works, to the effect, that the Board proposed to introduce into Parliament a Bill to Regulate the Stacking of Firewood in the Metropolis, and in connection therewith were desirous of obtaining information with regard to the places at which firewood is stacked in different parts of London, and asking the Vestry to instruct their Surveyor to furnish the Board with information as to the dimensions of the larger stacks of firewood in their district, and the nearness of any such stacks to adjacent dwelling houses or other buildings, a resolution was passed as follows, viz.:— "Resolved that this Vestrv do not approve of the Bill brought in by the Metro"politan Board of Works for the safe keeping of firewood within the limits of the "Metropolis, believing that it will have the effect of curtailing the business of firewood "merchants, and of driving the store yards out of the Metropolis, thus depriving an "exceedingly numerous, and very poor and deserving class of people of their only "means ol livelihood, and causing them to become chargeable to the parish, and that "the Vestry do petition the House of Commons against the said Bill." A copv of the resolution was sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works; copies of the resolution were also sent to the several Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis with a request that they would co-operate with the Vestrv in opposing the Bill. The Metropolitan Board of Works ultimately withdrew the said Bill from Parliament. 25 In April, 1886, the Vestry presented a Petition to the House of Commons through Colonel C. E. Hamilton, M.P., for the Rotherhithe Division of the Borough of Southwark, praying that the law should be amended so as to confer power on Local Authorities to rate the ground rents of London for all Municipal and Local purposes, so that local burdens may be fairly divided between Owners and Occupiers. By the formal orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works the houses in the following streets have been re-numbered, viz.:—Nelson-street, Debnams-road, and Forsyth-street. The Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. Under the provisions of the above Act, the total assessment of properties in the oarish of Rotherhithe at the quinquennial valuation in 1885, is as follows, viz.:— Gross Value. Rateable Value. £254,387 0s. 0d. £205,250 0s. 0d. / , APPENDIX No. 1. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, During the year, March 25th, 1885, to March 25th, 1880. Gentlemen, The bases upon which the calculations embodied in the following report are founded, are first, the number of inhabitants in my last report, and secondly, the natural increase which has been registered from week to week. I speak of natural increase, for it is not in my power to ascertain the increase due to the greater accommodation from the building that has been going on during the period of this report. This could only be got at by a fresh census. As I have not that basis to go upon, and as 1 would rather not make a guess as to what it might be, it will be more reasonable, though perhaps it may not be absolutely correct, to proceed upon the first method of calculation. Of course, this mode of proceedure is open to one serious objection, that is, it is not a mathematically correct basis, but it will only show an approximation to the total number of persons living in the parish. First then ; the total number of inhabitants in the parish, on March 25th, 1885, was 40,343. Since then the entire natural increase has been— Males. Females. Totals. In first quarter 78 68 146 In second quarter 89 111 200 In third quarter 99 76 175 In fourth quarter 66 36 102 Total natural increase 332 291 623 This raises the number of inhabitants in the parish approximately to 40,966. The number of births registered is:— Males. Females. Totals. In hrst quarter 176 139 315 In second quarter 188 192 380 In third quarter 222 185 407 In fourth quarter 189 151 340 1 he number of deaths registered is :— Males. Females. Totals In first quarter 98 71 169 In second quarter 98 82 180 In third quarter 125 107 232 In fourth quarter 122 116 238 The birth rate per thousand per annum is 36.2. The death rate per thousand per annum is 17.9. 27 Zymotic Diseases. The deaths due to the principal Zymotic diseases, with rate per thousand per anniim:— Tvphus fever none Typhoid fever 7 .175 Scarlet fever 8 .198 Measles 15 .37 Diptheria 1 .025 Diarrhoea ... 28 .69 Small-pox ... 7 .175 Whooping-cough 13 .32 Diseases of Respiratory Organs. The number of deaths from these diseases, which unfortunately, I have not been able satisfactorily to classify into their distinct orders, has been 334, giving a death rate of 8.27 per thousand per annum. Inquests. During the twelve months fifty-four inquests have been held. Uncertified Deaths. Three deaths only have not been certified. These were infants who lived but a few hours. Bake Houses. These houses were visited by your Medical and Sanitary Officers. Many of them were found in very fair condition. To some of the proprietors, suggestions were made in order to secure greater cleanliness. Slaugter-houses and Cow-sheds Upon the application for renewal of the licenses for these places they were visited by your officers. Most of them were found in a satisfactory condition, or undergoing such repairs as would render them so. Water Supply. Not to enter minutely into the reports which have been received rom the Local Government Board relative to this matter, I may state generally, that the condition of the water supplied has been satisfactory. Houses in Cow Lane. During the year, the unsanitary condition of certain dwellings in Cow Lane, which had undergone alterations, occupied the attention of the Medical Officer in conjunction with the Vestry Clerk. The then owner, not having complied with the requirements of the Vestry, although he had given a verbal and written promise to do so, was obliged by a magistrate s order to close them. Thev were condemned as not fulfilling the needs of healthy habitations. 28 Railway Arches. In November, 1835. and February, 1886, your officer's attention was directed to the unhealthy condition of certain of the railway arches in the parish, and an offensive effluvium emanating from some works on a plot of land held from the S.E. R.Co. It is only necessary for me to remind you of the rather lengthy correspondence which took place between me and the medical adviser of the Co., who in the instance now spoken of, was the first to call attention to the matter. No good came of it. I regret that the condition of the places remains very much as it was prior to the discussion of the affair, and it appears likely to remain in abeyance until the hot season calls forth what I now begin to look upon as an annual summer complaint, or until something more serious than complaint arises. The Railway Co., have shown themselves either unwilling or afraid to set earnestly to work to get rid of the nuisances upon their own premises. I beg therefore most sincerely and anxiously to direct the attention of the Railway Co. to the fact, that the land on both sides of their lines is being covered with houses, and yet they allow these offensive and injurious manufactures to be carried on, not only to the detriment of the health of their own men and to the annoyance of their passengers, but also to the risk of the surrounding inhabitants. In the judgement of many eminent health officers, the best method of testing the health of any district, is by taking the zymotic diseases as a criterion, since these diseases in a great measure point to the localities which are badly drained, overcrowded, illventilated and filthy, and where the inhabitants mostly are poor, insufficiently nourished, or else indifferent as to the conditions requisite to good health, under which they live. There has been no special epidemic in any one particular locality, which has indicated a worse plague-spot than usual in our parish. The cases ot various kinds oi fever, small-pox, measles and diarrhoea have been sporadic rather than epidemic—that is, these cases have been scattered over the parish as isolated cases, rather than as taking whole streets, alleys, or courts. But even in these distinct cases, much aid might be afforded the Medical and Sanitary Officers, by an earlv notification of them from the medical attendant; and I think no undue interference, or officious display ot power would be shown, if your officers could by any means induce the medical practitioners to help them in this matter, which they deem of such vast importance to the health of every parishioner. We desire to render help as to matters of disinfecting and purifying, by which, if life be not absolutely saved in the cases attacked, the help might at least be useful in checking the spread of these direful complaints. e theiefore make what we deem a humane appeal to the practitioners to help us in these infectious cases, by notifying to the Sanitary or Medical Officer, at the Public mces, Lower Road, the occurrence ol cases wherein useful aid may be rendered, by oisinlection of house, or room, or bedding, or clothing, or by any other means. I am, Gentlemen, Truly yours, J. SHAW. Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX No. 2. VESTRYMEN, AUDITORS, AND OFFICERS OF THE PARISH OF ROTHERHITHE, SURREY.
