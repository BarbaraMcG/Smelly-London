Gentlemen, We beg to present the following report upon the state of the Poole and Ravensbourne rivers:— Our first sample of water was taken from a tributary of the Poole just where it is crossed by the bridge in the Beckenham Road. The clear water had a distinct taste and smell of sewage, and the bed of the river was covered with black sewage mud. The stream was traced upwards for some distance along several meadows, but throughout was contaminated largely with sewage. Having noticed the second branch of the Poole at the Penge end of the Beckenham Road, which presented a similar appearance to the first, we proceeded to the Green Lanes, and examined the mouth of the culvert there discharging into this second branch: it was pouring out an amount of sewage apparently fifteen or twenty times greater than that of the stream water. There was an abundance of solid lumps of excrement floating about at the junction. We took our second sample of water from the Poole River just before it passes under the bridge in Southend Lane. The bed of the stream was lined with sewage mud, and the water had all the appearance of liquid sewage. We next examined a third branch of the Poole, close to the Crystal Palace Company's gas works at Sydenham, and running almost at right angles to them. This water smelt strongly of sewage, but did not show any evidence of contamination with gas refuse. We next proceeded along the course of the Poole to its outfall into the Ravensbourne. The River Poole throughout the latter part of its extent, where it runs more or less parallel to the railway, was in a most offensive condition, evolving bubbles of gas from decomposition, and emitting a stench which could be recognized for a considerable distance. We took our third sample of water from the River Ravensbourne, where it passes under the Railway Bridge, a little above the point at which it receives the outflow of the Poole. The Ravensbourne was here pellucid, tasteless, and inodorous. We took our fourth sample from the Ravensbourne at about 100 yards below its junction with the Poole. The very tortuous character of the Ravensbourne at this part of its course served to produce a complete mingling of the two streams. The admixture of the Poole water effected a great deterioration in the appearance of the Ravensbourne, which, however, became less marked as we proceeded downwards. Our fifth sample was taken from the Ravensbourne immediately below Catford Mill and Railway Station. All five samples of water were obtained from the surfaces of the respective streams, with the least possible disturbance of mud. After filtration through fine paper they yielded the following results:— Grains per Imperial Gallon. Total. Mineral. Organic. Ammonia. I. Poole at Beckenham Road Bridge 30.70 26.80 3.90 1.46 II. Poole at Southend Lane Bridge 38.60 33.60 5.00 1.88 III. Ravensbourne in meadow at Railway Bridge 22.00 20.40 1.60 0.00 IV. Ravensbourne after junction of Poole 23.80 21.75 2.05 0.28 V. Ravensbourne beyond Catford Mill 23.60 21.60 2.00 — The amount of ammonia may be taken to represent the degree of contamination with animal organic matter. From our observations and experiments we draw the following conclusions:— The Poole water, as shown by its appearance and the results of its analysis, is almost entirely liquid sewage; whilst the Ravensbourne, prior to the outflow of the Poole, 11 ?ems to be an unobjectionable stream. The examination of the mixed stream shows tat the pure Ravensbourne water is contaminated with about 1/8 of its bulk of Poole ?wage, whereby it is, of course, rendered quite unsuitable to serve as a source of water appty- The actual addition to the impurity of the Ravensbourne water by the influx of the ?oole sewage, though seemingly not very great, is, nevertheless, most important from ?s highly objectionable character. The additional half grain of animal organic matter ?er gallon, contributed to the Ravensbourne by the Poole, is of much more consequence ? a sanitary point of view than the grain and a half of vegetable organic matter ?riginally existing in it. The bad effects produced by the influx of the Poole sewage doubtless became less ?atense lower down the Ravensbourne—the organic matter being gradually altered by ?xidation; but the water at Catford Mill, though less turbid than that higher up, was ?ound to manifest much the same chemical characters, so far as regards its dissolved ?onstituents.

Five deaths have taken place from all causes in Blackheath; fourteen in Lewisham; two in the Union Workhouse; eight in Sydenham; two in Penge; one in the North Surrey District School, Penge; one in the Waterman's Asylum, Penge; one in the Royal Naval Asylum, Penge. Two deaths have taken place in the district from inflammation of the breathing organs. Three also from pulmonary consumption. Three deaths have taken place from epidemic diseases, viz.—one from hooping cough in Home's Dale, Lewisham, and two from diptheria, of which one took place in Lewisham Park, and one in Silver Street, Lewisham. A death took place from natural decay at the age of 90, in Camden Cottages, Blackheath, and one at the age of 89 in Lewisham. Besides these, four deaths took place between the ages of 70 and 80. The deaths of eleven children under 5 years of age are registered. A groom died from an accident at the Crystal Palace Station. Of epidemic diseases, hooping cough is still rather prevalent. The completion of the iron sewer under the Anerly Canal, suggests to my mind the great importance of using some means by deodorization and filtration or direct drainage, to relieve the Ravensbourne of the additional amount of poisonous filth which will be thrown into it when the Norwood Sewage is added to that of Penge. 13 I present to you a complaint put into my hands by a Committee of the Board of Management of the North Surrey School, relating to an offensive nuisance resulting ?om the overflow of cesspools into the ditch bounding the school property. I wish also to direct your attention to the importance of affording some means to the ?habitants of Ravensbourne Park, of draining their premises, by the construction of a ?wer. The offensive state of parts of the Park from want of drainage is already efore you. The premises known as Eliza Place, Forest Vale, Sydenham, inhabited by Miss Croxon ?nd another, arc offensive and prejudicial to health, from an old cesspool left in ?raining the premises.

The average mortality for the past six years shows a slight increase for this month. Hooping cough has been the most prevalent and the most fatal of the zymotic class of diseases. A fatal case of typhus fever occurred at Lady Well, and a rapidly fatal case of sore throat (not registered as malignant), also occurred in Exchequer Place, Lewisham. Nine deaths have occurred from zymotic disease, namely— Lewisham— May 1. Female, 25 years, typhus, Lady Well. „ 4. Male, 20 years, cynanche tonsillaris, Exchequer Place. Blackheath— April 29. Female, 3 years, hooping cough, Essex Place. 14 Sydenham— May 2. Male, 4 months, hooping cough, Sydenham. „ 5. Male, 1 year, ditto, Sydenham. ,, 6. Male, 4 years, ditto, Sydenham. „ 7. Male, 2 years, fever, Sydenham. ,, 16. Female, 11 months, hooping cough, Forest Hill. ,, 18. Female, 7 weeks, ditto, Forest Vale. Seven persons have died of consumption, and six from inflammation of the lungs. Several cases of opthalmia have occurred at the North Surrey School. A low form of fever is prevalent in Lewisham, and I have to call your attention ?? the great want of water supply in Lewisham, most especially in Loampit Yale; ?? point which I brought under your notice more than twelve months ago. No drainag?? can be complete without a sufficient supply of water, and I believe further, that the fever which is now affecting many persons in a great measure depends upon the ba?? quality of the water; I have, therefore, again to request your order that a supply may be obtainable in every house. The river, upon which many persons in its neighbourhood solely depend for their water supply, has been drained off whilst repairs are being carried on, and the remaining water and mud have been very offensive and unwholesome In Price's Buildings and the new houses at the back, a pump, hitherto supposed to have been supplied by a spring, appears to have been supplied by drainage from the river; at all events it has recently become in some way contaminated, and several persons have become affected with fever and diarrhoea, in consequence of drinking this water. At the Lodge, in Ravensbourne Park, two cases of typhoid fever have occurred; the water of the pump well was found to be contaminated, and the supply was accordingly cut off. It is of great importance to supply all these localities with good water. At 2, Sandwell Place, the drains have been stopped up, and from their being carried under the house, have been productive of serious inconvenience. A sewer in Willow Road, Sydenham (at the back of Mr. Plumley's premises) has been burst for a month past, and has become a most offensive nuisance; it requires immediate attention. The offensive state of the ditch near the Anerly Station still requires attention. The drainage also of the "City of London Tavern" requires carrying into the sewer now immediately in front of it; at present it runs into the open ditch. The house No. 4, Carlton Villas, Sydenham Park, is in a most offensive state from open communication with the sewer, and requires immediate attention.

The health of the district, as evidenced by the tables of mortality, has assumed a very favourable aspect. The average number of deaths during a corresponding period in the last six years has amounted to 31.2; whereas during the past month, the mortality has not exceeded twenty-four. Thirty-eight deaths were registered in June of last year. The typhoid fever mentioned in my last report, "as prevalent in parts of Lewisham," has nearly subsided. Hooping cough has been, and still is, prevalent in all parts of the dirtrict. Opthalmia has been prevalent at the North Surrey Industrial School, but has moderated in severity. Seven deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, namely— 2nd June. Scarlet fever, Granville Park, Blackheath. 24th May. Typhoid fever, Price's Buildings, Lewisham. 28th „ Hooping cough, Silver Street, Lewisham. 27th „ Diarrhoea, Rushey Green, Lewisham. 7th June. Hooping cough, Osborne Cottages, Lewisham. 6th „ Fever, Dartmouth Road, Sydenham. 18th „ Hooping cough, Perry Vale, Sydenham. The drainage of Wells Terrace, Wells Road, Sydenham, requires attention; the backs of the houses, which are offensive and unwholesome, require proper closets and water supply; such works might be carried out with the existing means of drainage in Wells Road. The new shops erected near the Anerly Station of the Croydon Railway appear to be carrying their drains into the old piece of canal under which a sewer has just been placed; this will tend again to contaminate the water, which has been diminished in quantity for the supply of the brickyard adjoining.

The mortality thus registered is much below that of the last six years ; the average mortality being represented by twenty-seven. Three deaths only have been registered from epidemic disease, namely— June 28th. Hooping cough, Ravensbourne Park, Lewisham. July 4th. Diptheria, Eastdown Park, Lewisham. „ 9th. Typhus, Union Workhouse. The latter being a case brought from Bell Green, Sydenham, some weeks back. Several cases of smallpox have occurred in Raglan Street, Sydenham, caught from a patient sent home into that locality with the disease. A washerwoman in whose house cases occurred, communicated it to a family in Park End, by means of linen entrusted to her to wash. Hooping cough is prevalent, but not to the same extent; scarlatina is also prevalent in a small degree. The opthalmia mentioned in my last report as being endemic at the North Surrey School has materially abated. Your attention is also directed to Mr. Whomes's houses in Silver Street, Lewisham, the inhabitants of which are suffering from want of drainage and water supply ; No. 11, is in a dangerously filthy state. Also to a large quantity of manure stored at Mr. Holford's, next to the Castle Inn, which is complained of as being an offensive nuisance; such store should not be allowed in immediate proximity to dwelling houses. Wells Terrace, Wells Road, Sydenham, requires immediate attention; very offensive privies exist there, and have been before brought under your notice. It appears to me that these ought to be drained into the existing sewer. The analysis of the water of the Ravensbourne River is in progress, but it would be more satisfactory to take the opportunity of selecting some samples when the river is less diluted with rainfall than it has been for some weeks.

Four persons have died from epidemic disease, namely— 30th July. Diptheria, Church Grove, Lewisham. 22nd „ Diarrhoea, Spencer Place, Blackheath. 6th Aug. Small pox, Raglan Place, Sydenham. 15th „ Diarrhoea, Bell Green, Sydenham. Six persons have died from consumption, and two from inflammation of the lungs. A man aged about 50 was found dead on the 11th inst., apparently from want and exposure. A master mariner, aged 65, died suddenly on 23rd of July, in a first-class carriage on the Crystal Palace Railway. No fresh case of smallpox has occurred. Summer diarrhoea from chills, and indigestible food, is prevalent in the whole district. With reference to the contamination of the Ravensbourne water, as explained in a recent report, I believe from extensive observation, that no plan of drainage would be successful which did not entirely absorb the Poole river, and remove it from the Ravensbourne. The sources of polution are, many of them, far removed from this district, and are so numerous and extensive, that in my opinion, no other plan can be successful. The inhabitants living near the course of this stream and its polluted tributaries, all complain bitterly, and not without cause, as its foul smell must be a ceaseless source of illness. In pursuance of the direction of the Board, I have again visited the Rushey Green district; the nuisances complained of consist of various kinds, which I have enquired into. A great many pigs are kept in this neighbourhood, indeed, in a portion of the district, a pigsty seems to exist at the back of almost every cottage; some are kept in a moderately clean condition, others are very filthy and offensive, and require removal or repeated inspection; the aggregate smell from these nuisances is very offensive. In the "Rising Sun" yard some offensive manure was lying, which should not be allowed to accumulate in an inhabited locality. Pigs are also kept here, but the styes were being lime-washed and cleansed. At Mr. Jones's manufactory I examined some coppers containing offensive material, left after melting down some damaged lard, salvage bought from the site of the fire at London Bridge. It was in melting this substance (always in the night), that the injurious smells complained of by the neighbours originated. This will, 1 am assured, not be repeated again. Pigs are also kept here, but in a very clean condition. Complaints have been received of the offensive state of the ditch or open sewer in Perry Vale. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. 18 METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer.

The mortality of the district has been for the past four weeks considerably below the average. The number of deaths has been twenty-six; the average, without taking into consideration the great increase of inhabitants, would be 35 1-Gth. Epidemic disease has not been generally prevalent, but six deaths have taken place from this class of disease, namely— In Lewisham— 26th Aug. Diarrhoea, Silk Mills. 4th Sept. Diptheria, Rushcy Green 10th ,, Diarrhoea, Rushey Green. In Blackheath— 25th Aug. Scarlet fever, Lamb's Buildings. 25th ,, Diarrhoea, Queen Street. In Sydenham— 15th Sept. Diptheria, Hanover Street. In Penge— 18th Sept. Typhoid fever. Several cases of diptheria have been reported at Rushcv Green, in the block of houses between the " Rising Sun " and the Driftway ; and the medical men in attendance apprehended the further extension of the disease. The houses in which these cases have taken place are dirty and without ventilation, and with a deficient supply of light. The inhabitants of such houses arc necessarily in a favourable state for the reception of disease. None of these houses have water laid on over the closets, and the inhabitants (with two or three exceptions, where there are pumps upon the premises), have to fetch water 19 from some little distance, and in every case have to throw water down to clcanse the closet pans; in these cases drainage is useless, because inaffective. The drains have not been properly flushed, and from the small quantity of rain which has fallen for the last few months, the drain traps are unstopped, and to the leakage of drain gas affecting those morbidly disposed, is to be attributed the occurrence of the disease. The number of pigs also kept in that locality was noted in my last report. Appended is a note from Mr. Beale, of Lower Sydenham, in consequence of which, on the 12th inst. I examined the nuisance complained of. A stream of offensive sewage was running in the ditch at the bottom of the meadow, some 300 yards from the house ; a pond into which the stream empties itself, is full of black semi-solid sewage (in fact a large open cesspool), out of which the stream overflows into the adjoining properties. By reference to my report for May, 1860, you will observe that I pointed out to you what would take place if the sewage were allowed to run in this direction ; it has now become a most offensive nuisance. A gully near Forest Hill Station is every offensive, and requires trapping. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality arc appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

The death returns during four weeks ending 20th October, 1860, being twentyfive. The returns during five weeks ending upon the 26th of this month, being forty eight. An increase has taken place in the number of deaths referred to the zymotic class of disease (that class in which sanitary measures can be successfully employed in the way of prevention), ten deaths being registered from this class of disease; whereas in 1860, only one death was referred to this class. Thus in Blackheath— 26th Sept. Female, 89, diarrhoea, The Pitts. 20 1st Oct. Female, 69, diarrhoea, Dartmouth Row. 24th „ Female, 35, fever, Bath place. 1st „ Female, 69, diarrhoea, Dartmouth Row. In Lewisham— 23rd Sept. Female, 5 weeks, diarrhoea, Lewis Grove. 18th Oct. Female, 2 months, diarrhoea, Rushey Green. 22nd „ Female, 19, fever, Lewisham. In Sydenham— 19th Sept. Female, 18 weeks, diarrhoea, Bell Green. 30th ,, Female, 87, diarrhoea, Bell Green. In Penge— 3rd Oct. Male, 8 years, diptheria, Penge. The mortality from all causes has been principally at the extremes of infancy and old age. Thus, fourteen deaths have occurred in those under 1 year; eight deaths in those between 60 and 70; five deaths in those between 70 and 80; and seven deaths in those between 80 and 90 years of age. An instance of the danger of neglecting sanitary precautions has occurred in the house of Mr. Croxon, Forest Yale. I have reported several times to the Board the offensive odours in this house. The house was let furnished to a family consisting of five adults and five children. The servants have been frequently attacked with sickness and febrile symptoms. The gentleman of the house had a severe attack of diptheritic sore throat; the lady of the house had a dangerous attack of typhoid fever; after this, as the house was unfit for occupation, I recommended that as soon as the patients could be removed with safety, they should go to the sea-coast, and immediately upon their arrival at Eastbourne, the children were attacked with measles. Several offensive untrapped gully holes exist in Dartmouth Park, and require attention. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

Seven deaths have taken place from zymotic disease, namely— In Blackheath— 24th Oct. Fever, Bath Place. In Lewisham— 18th Nov. Scarlet fever, Southend. Sydenham— 31st Oct. Typhus fever, Wells Road, 6th Nov. Typhoid fever, Kirkdale. 12th „ Scarlet fever, West Kent Park. 16th ,, Results of smallpox, Raglan Street. In Penge— 27th Oct. Hooping cough, Penge. Five deaths have taken place from consumption of the lungs. Two deaths from inflammation of the lungs. No particular epidemic disease is very prevalent, but cases of scarlet fever and of hooping cough exist in the district At Blackheath considerable inconvenience has arisen from the ground having been raised, by the accumulation of a quantity of earth (from the foundations of Mr. Glenton's houses), in front of the entrance to Russell Square. In consequence of this, during the recent rainfall, all the houses here, as well as the back premises of some of the houses in Tranquil Yale, have been flooded, and it is requisite to have proper drainage supplied as early as possible. Mr. Samuel's cow-yard is not kept sufficiently clean, and the adjoining houses are still without any water closet of any kind. In Sydenham the unpleasant smell from pigs kept in Willow Road is much complained of by the inhabitants of the houses in the park ; I have several times brought this under your notice by the request both of the owners and tenants of the abovenamed houses. In Dartmouth Park, near Forest Hill Church, two most offensive gullies require trapping. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

The mortality of the district has been less than that of last year, when forty-four deaths were recorded, and considerably less than the average number, which, without including increase of population, has been for the last six years, thirty-six. The health of the district has suffered from the rapid and considerable changes of temperature, which have occurred during the month ; catarrhs and sore throats have been prevalent as well as hooping cough and scarlatina. A second instance of the occurrence of endemic zymotic disease, manifestly occasioned by imperfect drainage, has made its appearance in a new semi-detached house in Havensbourne Park, Lewisham, in which the drains were untrapped (the escaping sulphuretted hydrogen blacking the water pipes which were painted with white lead, which substance always indicates the presence of this poisonous gas), and to which no air shaft was supplied to relieve the sewer of its foul gases. Of six inhabitants of this house, two servants were dangerously affected with typhoid fever, the master and mistress of the house were affected, the former with prostrating diarrhoea, the latter with dangerous typhoid diarrhoea, and the infant with an alarming attack of diarrhoea; so that out of six residents, five risked their lives from exposure to the poison. The inhabitants of the adjoining house were also suffering to a less degree from the same cause, and in the first case I directed the family to be moved from the house until the drains were put into complete order. Since my last report the offensive gullies complained of in Dartmouth Park, have been trapped, but two large additional air shafts have been placed in the road, which send forth a most disgusting effluvium, which is to be detected for a considerable distance ; such air shafts if necessary, should be supplied with charcoal boxes at their outlet, to destroy their poisonous emanations. Three deaths only have occurred from zymotic disease, namely— In Blackheath— 22nd Nov. Female, 20 months, hooping cough, Spencer place. In Sydenham— 30th Nov. Female, 6 months, diarrhoea, Orchard Place. In Lewisham— 11th Dec. Female, 3 years, scarlet fever, Regent Street. Of the deaths in the district, five have taken place under 5 years of age; three above the age of 60 years; six above the age of 70 years; five above the age of 80 years; and one above the age of 90 years.

This number is above the average number for the month. The sudden alternations of temperature have told with fatal effect upon the young and aged. Thus, of the above number, twenty-one have been those of children under 5 years of age, whilst thirteen have been amongst those whose ages ranged from GO to 95 years. Six deaths have been occasioned by zymotic disease, namely— 28th Dec. Scarlet fever, Eliot Place, Blackheath. 6th Jan. Hooping cough, King Street, Blackheath. 25th Dec. Fever, Hexamer Place, Lewisham. 1st Jan. Hooping cough, Loampit Dale, Lewisham. 2nd Jan Croup, Woodlands, Lewisham. 7th Jan. Scarlet fever, Peak Hill, Lewisham. A child died in King Street, Lewisham, from injuries received from his clothes catching fire. A servant in Lower Sydenham was burnt to death, from her clothes having accidentally caught fire. Influenza and other catarrhal affections, attended with great depression of the circulation and nervous system, have been very prevalent. Scarlatina has also been prevalent. Since my last report, another severe case of typhoid fever, arising from the dangerous non-sanitary state of a house in Ravensbourne Park, has occurred, and the young man is still in considerable danger. I wish to call your attention to the unsatisfactory state of the drainage of Ravensbourne Park. The drains from the house in which so much sickness has arisen (as mentioned to you in my last report), have been trapped, and a ventilating shaft constructed (at the expense of the tenant) ; but the outlet of the drain is several feet below the sewer into which it discharges, and which, moreover, is of a smaller calibre, and therefore an elongated cesspool remains, which must eventually be blocked up. The water supplied from the pump-well to this house, contains 111.48 grains of total impurity, of which 19.6 are organic, no doubt derived from the surface drainage of the meadow in which it is situated. The muddy state of the roads and footpaths is much complained of in Sydenham, and will not be improved unless the road scrapings arc more frequently removed. They lie about for a considerable time, and have not only the effect of spoiling the roads, thus being a source of expense, but they are from their wetness a source of sickness. A mud cart should be supplied by the contractors. The offensive effluvium from the large air shafts from the sewer near the church, in Dartmouth Park, is much complained of. The swampy state of Willow Road, Sydenham, is also complained of, and must be a source of sickness. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

Forty-eight births, and fifty-nine deaths, have been registered in the district The number of deaths is the largest I have had to report to you, and is considerably above the average; and for the first time since I have held the appointment of officer of health, is in excess of the births. This is particularly observable in Penge, where two births and twelve deaths have been recorded. Twelve deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, namely— In Blackheath— Female, 3 months, scarlet fever, Paragon Mews. Female, 2 months, scarlet fever, Paragon Mews. Male, 3 months, scarlet fever, Paragon Mews. Female, 7 months, malignant scarlet fever, Dartmouth Terrace. In Lewisham— Female, 1 year, diptheria, Southend. Female, 13 years, diptheria, Southend. Male, 5 months, measles, Regent Street. In Sydenham— Female, 2 months, hooping cough, West Kent Park. Female, 4 weeks, hooping cough, West Kent Park. Male, 4 months, hooping cough, Hamburg Place. Female, 29 years, typhus fever, Peak Hill. In Penge— Female, 10 years, scarlet fever, North Surrey District School. Although not all included in the Registrar's returns for this week, I am informed that five deaths have taken place from malignant diptheria in one family at Southend, resident at the Tiger's Head Inn; and that several more cases have occurred in this neighbourhood. It is about eighteen months ago that an epidemic of typhoid fever occurred in this same locality, which affected upwards of fifty persons. I have examined the locality in which the above mentioned cases of diptheria have occurred (the Tiger's Head Inn), and find that the house is dilapidated, and has a close smell about it. It is situated upon the brink of the river Ravensbourne, and a private sewer opens into the river close to the house. The river is also offensive from sewage contained in it. Paragon Mews I have before brought under your notice; three deaths have occurred there from scarlet fever. Peak Hill, Sydenham, is without drainage; a case of typhus fever has occurred here. West Kent Park is damp, and insufficiently drained, both as to surface drainage and sewage, and abounds in cesspools. I have already brought under your notice the bad state of the roads at the back of the Forester Inn, and Willow Road, Sydenham. Suffice it to say, that they are 25 extremely dangerous to passengers, and from their damp, miry state, they tend to make the neighbourhood unhealthy. A new street, leading from Hindsley's Place, Sydenham, to the Forest Hill Schools 'Chaplin Street), is unmade and undrained, although most of the houses on each side of the street are inhabited. The offensive drainage from a portion of Laurie Park, running at the back of Messrs. Beale's and Danson's, is still unaltered and very offensive, and requires a remedy. The drainage running from the Wells Road, &c., in an open ditch through the grounds of Messrs. Schwartz and Mayow Adams, and at the back of the Dolphin Inn and Mr. Ogilvie's, Lower Sydenham, is very offensive, and should be covered in. A house occupied by Mr. Standen, Russell Street, has its drain blocked up, and is without water supply. Scarlet fever is prevalent in the district, and a few cases of this disease have occurred in the North Surrey District School at Anerly. Hooping cough is also prevalent in a minor degree.

The number of deaths, although above the average, is less than that registered for the same month in 1860, when sixty-two deaths occurred. Eleven deaths have taken place from zymotic disease. Thus in Blackheath— 12th Mar. Malignant scarlet fever, Tranquil Vale, In Lewisham— 25th Feb.

In Penge— Scarlatina, North Surrey School. In Union Workhouse— 19th Mar. Diarrhoea, Union Workhouse. Three deaths from diptheria are registered as having occurred at Southend; these were mentioned in my last report, since which I have examined some water obtained from the Ravensbourne at this locality, and which many of the inhabitants use for domestic purposes; I find that it is largely contaminated with vegetable and animal organic matter, and after standing for a few days becomes decomposed and very offensive. I consider this a dangerous supply for domestic purposes, and to have been a cause of the disease which has afflicted so many of the inhabitants of that district. It is important that water should be obtained from a less contaminated source, for which purpose wells might be sunk in the district, and no doubt a good supply obtained. Scarlatina has affected several of the children in the North Surrey School. Two cases of hooping cough are also under treatment there. The children affected with these diseases have been isolated, so as, as far as possible, to prevent the spread of the disorder. Notwithstanding that a few cases of scarlatina have occurred, I think that the district as a whole is very healthy, and contrasts very favourably with the neigbourhoods round London. In a neighbouring parish, fever is prevalent and very fatal. I have received a communication from the Committee of the Forest Hill Schools, relative to the state of Chaplin Street (immediately opposite the school-house), a subject which I alluded to in my last report. This road, as well as that at the back of the Forester Inn, are in such a state of filth and decomposition from refuse vegetable matter thrown upon the surface, that they are dangerous to the health of the neighbouring inhabitants. The boundary ditch between the footpath and the North Surrey Schools has been and is most offensive from the sewage poured into it from two or three houses above, and the evil is increasing in intensity. About 100 yards of drain pipe from these houses into the drain at Ancrly park, would relieve this nuisance. This is particularly desirable at a time when an epidemic is affecting some of the children of the adjacent school. The Board of Management of the School have particularly requested me to urge this upon your attention. The inhabitants of Raglan Street (Sydenham), are suffering from the open ditch at one end, and the undrained land with sewage on its surface; the Poor Law Medical Officer represents the place as particularly unhealthy. The roads in Hanover Street and Silver Street, Lewisham, arc very filthy, and require attention. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.
