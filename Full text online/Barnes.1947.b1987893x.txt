Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report on the health of the Borough during the year 1947. Although I present this report, the Medical Officer of Health during most of the period under review was in fact Dr. R. C. Webster, who resigned his appointment as Medical Officer of Health upon obtaining an appointment with another authority. He left the service of the Barnes Borough Council on the 9th October, 1947. In view of the prospective changes anticipated under the National Health Service Act, the post was not filled but I was appointed Acting Medical Officer of Health pending some more definite knowledge of the re-organisation of Health Services under the new Act. This will be the last report of a complete year's work of the Health Department under conditions existing before the introduction of the National Health Service Act. The maternity and child welfare services, the infectious diseases hospital and the ambulance service will all pass out of the jurisdiction of the Barnes Borough Council, and only the work of the Sanitary Inspectors, the control of infectious diseases and one or more small services will remain. The work of the Public Health Department has been well performed throughout the years, no less as a result of the efficiency of the staff but also because of the personal interest of the members of the Council. Together the local knowledge and interest of the Council and staff has resulted in a progressive health service whereby the needs of the public have been well served over a period of many years. Change is inevitable, but nevertheless it is a sad moment when the pride taken in local work well done and locally appraised is no more. At the time of writing, the future of many of the members of the staff in the new Health Service is obscure, but among those who have been transferred already to the County are the three Health Visitors, Miss M. Parnell, Miss J. McNish and Miss O. L. Wilson. It is only fitting that some reference should be made to 5 these three officers, who together have a total of 62 years' service in the Borough. It would be impossible to estimate how many mothers and children during these years have benefited by their im sensational but highly important efforts. Although their work has been accepted as a matter of course, there is no doubt that the interest, commonsense, help and advice given by them has been of vital importance to the proper functioning of the maternity and child welfare work in the Borough. A great deal of the work performed by them cannot be appreciated if considered statistically only. Much is advisory and is dependent upon their sympathetic appreciation of the difficulties of mothers. In all these ways the Council has been excellently served by the three officers now transferred to the County Council. No review of the work of this department before the transfer of many of its members to the Surrey County Council would be complete without a reference to our Chief Clerk—Mr. R. E. Forrest —who, during his 20 years' service in the Public Health Department, has done much valuable work for this authority. For myself, I should like to express my appreciation of his everwilling help and unfailing loyalty, and also to all the other members of the existing staff, at this moment when the department is breaking up. Their conscientious and good work has been a considerable factor in the efficient functioning of the department. One other member of the Public Health Department with many years' service will be retiring before the preparation of another Report—Mr. Charles S. Perchard, Chief Sanitary Inspector and Housing Manager. Coming to Barnes in 1918, he has taken in his stride many changes in legislation; the development of the area from a comparatively small urban district to its present size; and a world war with all its fresh problems and day-to-day extemporisations. Latterly, as Housing Manager, he has been called upon to deal with the unenviable problem of re-housing. Throughout the years he has proved himself a conscientious and good local government officer and from my own experience of his help I would like to take this opportunity of thanking him for his continued assistance and advice. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROSETTA HILL, October, 1947. Acting Medical Officer of Health. 6 BOROUGH OF BARNES. REPORT OF THE ACTING MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1947. PREFACE. In accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 170/47, the Annual Report for 1947 has been prepared on the same lines as previous years and consists of two parts, a preface in which reference is made to items of special interest and an appendix in which is tabulated the statistics relating to the health of the district. OFFICES. In October, 1947, the new Municipal Offices in Sheen Lane having been completed, the two parts into which the Public Health Department had been split by force of circumstance were again united under one roof. For the purposes of administration the reunion of the department was most satisfactory and the centralisation of the offices of all departments in one building of great advantage, both to the public and to the staff. STAFF. Mr. J. G. Plant, a temporary Sanitary Inspector, died on the 25th February, 1947, and Mr. G. G. Gardiner resigned and left on the 7th December upon obtaining an appointment with another local authority. Consequently, two further District Sanitary Inspectors were appointed to fill the vacancies thus caused—Mr. F. A. Sadler, commencing on the nth November, 1947, and Mr. E J. Silvester on the 8th December, 1947. Mr. A. A. Brown, Assistant Housing Manager, resigned his appointment and left on the 31st July. Pending fuller consideration of the possibility of separating the Housing Section from the Public Health Department and forming a separate department, it was decided not to fill this vacancy for the time being. In the meantime, it was decided to appoint Mr. G. E. Tydeman, a General Division Clerk in the department, as a Temporary Investigations Officer for re-housing purposes. Several changes in the clerical staff occurred during the year. Miss Morcom left on the 1st March and was replaced by Mr. H. W. Giles, who commenced duties on the 31st March; Miss P. A. Healey left on the 23rd August and was replaced by Mrs. P. M. Oakley, who commenced duties on the 27th October; Miss M. E. Wright, 7 clerk for School Medical purposes, left on the 30th November and the vacancy remained unfilled at the end of the year. Mr. D. A. Massam, a temporary junior, left on the 30th August, and Mrs. Alsford, a part-time shorthand typist, left on the 21st January and were not replaced. In October, 1947, the question of temporary staff was considered by the Council and it was decided to place Miss J. Campbell on the permanent establishment, and to retain Miss J. Dupille in a temporary capacity until the 1st November, 1948, when the matter would be again reviewed. Miss D. N. Callund resigned her appointment as Matron of Sheen Gate Gardens Day Nursery and left on the 6th February, 1947. Mrs. S. O. Brown was appointed to fill the vacancy and commenced duties on 24th March. SANITARY INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. The position with respect to the work of the Sanitary Inspectors eased somewhat during the year with the appointment of an additional Inspector to bring the staff up to establishment. More time was devoted to the inspection of food preparation premises and similar food visits. It is only recently, with improved facilities for repairs and extensions, that it has been practicable for necessary work to be required in order to bring such premises up to the standard envisaged at the time of the passing of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. A lot remains to be done in this direction, particularly with regard to the habits and conduct of employees in the food handling processes. With regard to the general work of the Sanitary Inspectors, housing conditions have taken up a large proportion of the time of the staff. Although the restrictions on building activity have been eased considerably, there is still a large amount of leeway to make up in the matter of dilapidations, a good proportion, of course, being due to war damage. The economic position of property owners, and the higher cost of building work have repercussions on the standard of repair and maintenance. Many owners, finding that mounting costs tend to make liabilities of their assets are reluctant to comply with notices, and extra persuasion and effort is called for, with the resultant increase in re-visits, interviews, correspondence, etc. RODENT CONTROL. In accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Rodent Control Division), the task of controlling rodent infestation in the sewers was commenced. A "test" baiting 8 of 10 per cent. of all the manholes on the foul sewers in the borough was undertaken. This showed that the Mortlake and East Sheen sections were lightly infested, whilst the sewers in the Barnes section were found to be almost free. Arrangements have been made for regular testing and maintenance treatments to be carried out at six-monthly intervals. Rodent infestations on private property were investigated and appropriate action taken. The existing law relating to Rodent Control is due for alteration, when the present arrangements will no doubt be revised. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and in quantity. Samples are taken regularly and frequently by the Metropolitan Water Board. There has been no evidence of either plumbo-solvency or of any form of contamination. The whole of the dwellings in the borough are supplied from public water mains direct to house. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The incidence of infectious diseases in the Borough during the year was, in general, low, although measles was epidemic during the first eight months of the year. It is pleasing to be able to say that although there were 437 cases of this disease notified, no death occurred. During August and September four sporadic cases of poliomyelitis and one case of polioencephalitis occurred. In addition to the five cases notified, one death from poliomyelitis was assigned to the Borough. This was a child of five years who had died in November in a London general hospital, diagnosis being made after death as the result of a Coroner's post mortem examination. Of the four cases of poliomyelitis, three were admitted to hospital and one was nursed at home. In two instances paralysis resulted, in one case extensive, and the other slight. The number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified during 1947 was the highest since 1914. Of some note is the fact that 10 per cent. of these were over 65 years of age, which, so far as this Borough is concerned, is an unusual incidence for that age group. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. The routine propaganda to encourage parents to have their children immunised against Diphtheria continued throughout the year. The percentage of children in the Borough under five years of age who have been immunised at the Borough Immunisation Clinic by the 31st December, 1947, is 48 per cent., 1,403 of the estimated population of 2,930. To these numbers should be added 9 10 per cent. for immunisations carried out privately or in other areas—a percentage obtained as a result of the house-to-house enquiry made by health visitors in 1943. This would mean that a better estimate of the percentage of children under five years immunised is 53 per cent. It should also be borne in mind that of the children under five years of age, until recently the group under one year could not commence to receive injections until at least 11 months of age. Thus, in practice, the number under five years immunised relates almost entirely to children aged one year and under five. Consequently, making allowance for the fact that few children under one year can complete immunisation before they are 12 months of age, to get a truer picture of the position it would be better to ignore the group under one year of age. If this is done, the percentage of children immunised over one but under five years of age is 65 per cent. Of the 3,860 children aged five years and under 14 years of age. 2,437 have been immunised at the Borough Clinic—a percentage of 63 per cent. If the estimated allowance for private immunisation, etc., is added, the percentage of such children estimated to be immunised in Barnes is 69 per cent. PROTECTION AGAINST WHOOPING COUGH. The Council's scheme for the free inoculation of children against whooping cough continues in operation. The number of children attending for inoculation against whooping cough continued without diminution during 1947. HOME HELPS SERVICE. The Home Help Service has continued throughout the year to cater for an obvious need. It has worked very satisfactorily and at the end of the year there were seven whole-time and three parttime helps employed in this work. All the Home Helps have worked well and there have been many expressions of appreciation of their assistance. CLEANSING STATION. The Barnes Cleansing Station continued to serve a necessary purpose throughout the year. There has been no alteration in the arrangements to combat infestation which were enumerated in detail in the Annual Report for 1944. In no case during the vear was it found necessary to take statutory action. BOROUGH ACCIDENT AND GENERAL PURPOSES AMBULANCE SERVICE. Details of the number of journeys made and the types of cases dealt with by the Borough Ambulances are given in Table 19. 10 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. Reference to the statistics relating to the Health Visitors shows a decrease in the number of home visits they were able to make during the year. This was partly due to an increased number of ante-natal clinics, previously reported as being necessary and established in 1946, which reduced the time available for home visiting, and partly to the illness of one of the Health Visitors, who was away ill for two months. Her absence not only resulted in the loss of visits which she herself would have carried out, but also the loss of time available to the other two Health Visitors as a result of them having to be present at the two or three clinics weekly which she would otherwise have attended. So far as the clinics are concerned, it is interesting to note that in 1938, 146 expectant mothers attended the ante-natal clinic and made a total number of attendances of 348. In 1947, 511, or threeand-a-half times as many attended, and made 2,017 attendances, or nearly six times as many as in 1938, an average attendance per session of 20 in 1947, contrasted with seven in 1938. It is obvious from these figures that despite the fact that additional ante-natal clinics were established in 1946, unless the clinics are to be overcrowded, additional clinics are really necessary. In 1938, 692 children made 7,352 attendances, a weekly average, of 142; in 1947, 1,401 children made 10,920 attendances, a weekly average of 213, or an increase of exactly 50 per cent, on the 1938 attendances. From these figures it will be seen that the clinics are more than well used. With the increase of work resulting from new duties introduced in recent years, it has become increasingly obvious that the number of Health Visitors in this Borough could quite well have been increased in order to cope with the additional work at the clinics and to increase the available home visiting time. Owing to the war and the shortage of Health Visitors, the possibility of obtaining an additional Health Visitor has been remote. Now that the County are taking over the Health Visiting staff, no doubt the necessity to employ at least an additional Health Visitor for this part of the division will be borne in mind. During the year, leaflets setting out all the maternity and child welfare provisions and information likely to be of use to expectant mothers and mothers of children were prepared by the department, printed in the form of a leaflet and distributed with the kind cooperation of the Ministry of Food through the local Food Office and, of course, by the staff of the Public Health Department. This dissemination of information proved to be of considerable use to the mothers and expectant mothers in the Borough and has brought to their notice information of services available of which they might otherwise have been ignorant.
