Lammas Rights. Metropolitan Asylums Board Wharf The Solicitor having reported that the Metropolitan Asylums Board had enquired whether in the event of Lammas Rights being sustained the Vestry would accept compensation in respect of their property, the Vestry, on the 30th March, 1892, resolved that the Board be informed that the Vestry would accept compensation. The Solicitor having on the 3rd August, 1892, reported hereon, as follows:- FULHAM VESTRY ats. HARWOOD. I have carefully perused and considered the letters from Mr. Sherry, of the 14th ult., and from Messrs. Last and Sons of the 22nd ult., and I am of opinion that the compensation mentioned in both those letters is not such as your Committee would be justified in recommending the Vestry to consider, as the actions have been defended, for the purpose of acquiring open spaces for the use of the public, and I think the County Council and others of the public might well complain if the Vestry were to receive mere compensation for the loss of their rights in lieu of those open spaces. I think, however, that your Committee might well recommend to the Vestry to agree to an Order of the Court as proposed by Mr. Sherry, provided that if the Vestry are successful in the actions, and if Lammas Rights be established, then the Arbitrators are to award to the Vestry, by way of compensation for the enclosure proposed to be made, such a sum as will enable the Vestry to purchase, in an equally convenient place within the parish, a plot of ground prescribed as an open space for ever, equal in area to the plot of ground to be enclosed, and also for 16 the Arbitrators to award such further sum as they may think fit, in respect of the loss to the Vestry incurred by reason of the enclosure of the said plot dividing the Lammas Lands into two parts. when it was resolved that the letters of Mr. Sherry, and Messrs. Last & Sons, together with the report of the Solicitor, be printed and circulated amongst the members of the Vestry, and a copy sent to the London County Council, on the 28th September, 1892, the Solicitor was instructed (1) to prepare a precis of the whole matter in respect to Lammas Rights, showing the present position of the Vestry, for submission to the London County Council; (2) to inform the London County Council that the Vestry renew their offer to subscribe £1000 towards the costs of the proceedings, upon condition that the Council take the case up; (3) to inform Mr. Sherry and Messrs. Last and Sons that the Vestry have approached the London County Council with reference to the conduct of the case re Lammas Rights, and feel that they cannot enter into negociations pending their reply. Mr. Sherry, Solicitor to the Plaintiffs, on the 14th July, 1892, served Mr. Blanco White, the Vestry's Solicitor, with notice of trial of action, and on the 21st December, 1892, the Law and Parliamentary Committee reported to the Vestry that they had appointed a SubCommittee to confer with the Solicitor and report with reference to the case Vestry ats Harwood, which Sub-Committee reported on the 1st February, 1893, as follows:— VESTRY ats. HARWOOD. Your Committee having been requested by the Solicitor to give directions as to the employment of professional searchers, to examine the old Court Rolls of the Manor of Fulham and the Parliamentary Records, appointed a Sub-Committee (whose appointment was confirmed by the Vestry on the 21st December, 1892), who report that having investigated the evidence already obtained by the Solicitor and the pleadings of the action, directed the Solicitor not to employ professional searchers, but to proceed with the obtaining of the evidence, and to prepare a case for the advice of Mr. Elton, Q.C., Mr. Casson, and Mr. Macaskie. The Sub-Committee further reported that they had the advantage of a consultation with the Counsel named, who advised them that, while there is every probability of the existence of Lammas Rights being established over the Town Meadows, in an action properly brought, yet in the present action, they considered the Vestry must fail, as they did not hold within the parish the qualifications necessary to entitle them to the exercise of these rights. The Sub-Committee were further advised that by consenting to judgment in the present actions, they would not hereafter, assuming that they acquire a proper qualification, be barred from establishing the existence of Lammas Rights. 17 Your Committee, therefore, recommend that the Vestry do instruct the Solicitor to consent on their behalf to judgement in the several actions brought against them in the terms asked in the respective statements of claim. That the question of Lammas Rights be further referred to your Committee to consider and report: This case came on for hearing in the Royal Courts of Justice, before Mr. Justice Kekewick, on the 17th, 22nd and 23rd February, 1893, when the Vestry were represented by Mr. Marten, Q.C., and Mr. Macaakie of Counsel, instructed by Mr. T. Blanco White, and Harwood's Trustees were represented by Mr. Warmington, Q.C., M.P., and Mr. Swinfen Lady, instructed by Mr. Sherry, when, after hearing the evidence of a large number of witnesses and the arguments of Counsel on both sides, the learned Judge gave his verdict against the Vestry, with 40s. damages, and costs, on High Court scale, to be taxed. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 1st March, 1893, the following report from the Solicitor was read:— HAKWOOD v. THE VESTRY. On Friday, the 17th February last, Mr. Marten, Q.C., and Mr. Macaskie moved the Court on behalf of the Vestry, that the Vestry being advised that they were not at the time of the trespass alleged in the Statement of Claim the owners or occupiers within the Manor of Fulham of any commonable lands upon which commonable beasts, levant and couchant, could be, an injunction might be granted restraining them, their servants or agents, from wrongfully entering upon the plaintiff's land in the Statement of Claim mentioned, or from wrongfully pulling down or damaging any fences thereon, or from wrongfully depasturing any horses, cows or other animals upon such lands, or any part thereof, with costs to be taxed. The Court ordered that the Vestry by their Counsel admitting that notwithstanding the allegations in the Statement of Defence, they were not at the time of the acts of trespass complained of by the plaintiffs seised of any lands, the seisin whereof might justify such alleged acts of trespass, and that the acts complained of by the plaintiff were done in respect of such a seisin then alleged, the action to proceed to trial on the question of damages only, and that the counter-claim pleaded by the Vestry be withdrawn. On Wednesday, the 22nd February last, the action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Kekewick, and after hearing the evidence submitted by Mr. Warmington, Q.C., and Mr. Swinfen Eady on behalf of the plaintiffs, and Mr. Marten, Q.C., and Mr. Macaskie on behalf of the Vestry, directed the Vestry to pay the sum of Forty Shillings damages, with costs to be taxed.

At the meeting of the Vestry on the 30th March, 1892, It was Resolved :— "That it be referred to the Sanitary Committee to consider and report in reference to the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health," and on the 13th April, 1892, that Committee reported That, as twenty members of the Vestry had requested the Clerk to place on the Agenda for the next Vestry Meeting, notice as to the re-appointment of the present Medical Officer of Health, they had adjourned the question of the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health until further instructions have been received from the Vestry. 24 And at the same meeting it was Resolved :— (1) That notice is hereby given to the Vestrymen of the Parish of Fulham under article 8 of "The Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891," this 13th day April, 1892, at one of the ordinary meetings of the said Vestry, that on the 27th day of April, 1892, at the next ordinary meeting of the Vestry, the proposed re-appointment of Dr. J. Edwin Cooney, D.P.H., as Medical Officer of Health for Fulham, under the aforesaid Order, will be made on the same terms of appointment as now existing, viz.:— at a salary of £400 a year, and the said Officer to give such time as is necessary to perform the duties of the office. The re-appointment to take effect on the termination of the present appointment on 8th June, 1892. (2) That the Clerk be instructed to place the foregoing proposed re-appointment on the Agenda Paper, for the Vestry Meeting on the 27th April, 1892, and that such business to be taken at 8 p.m. or as soon after as possible. On the 27th April, 1892, it was Besolved :— "That Dr. J. Edwin Cooney, D.P.H. be re-appointed as Medical Officer of Health for Fulham, under "The Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891," on the same terms of appointment as now existing, viz.:—at a salary of £400 a year, and the said Officer to give such time as is necessary to perform the duties of the office. The re-appointment to take effect on the termination of the present appointment on 8th June, 1892. And the Clerk was instructed to submit this resolution to the Local Government Board, together with the Vestry's resolution of the 13th April, 1892. On the 24th May, 1892, the Clerk read letter from the Local Government Board, drawing attention to their letters of the 14th and 29th April, 1891, and stating that they were still strongly of opinion that having regard to the increasing population of the Parish, it was very desirable that the Medical Officer of Health should be required to devote his whole time to the discharge of his duties, and requesting the Vestry to give the matter their careful re-consideration, the question being of greater importance as the Officer appointed would hold the office permanently, when It was Resolved :— That the Local Government Board be informed in reply to their letter of 19th inst., that the Vestry of Fulham have already on two occasions—of which resolutions have been recently forwarded to the Board—considered the Board's letters dated 14th and 29th April, 1891, (written before the appointment of the present Medical Officer of Health) and the advisability of appointing a Medical Officer of Health to devote his whole time to the discharge of his duties, and acting on the Local Govern- 25 went Board's request, they have again given the matter their careful consideration, and have resolved to abide by their previous decision in re-appointing Dr. J. E. Cooney the present Medical Officer of Health, at the same salary as before; he to devote so much of his time as may be necessary to the proper performance of his duties. The Vestry are aware that the present Medical Officer of Health cannot now be appointed for a limited period, and are convinced that with Dr. Cooney as Medical Officer of Health, the public health work of the Parish, as evidenced by the work done by him, and his annual and several special reports, would be well performed without his being required to devote his whole time to his duties. The Vestry are of opinion that if it be necessary to appoint a whole-time Medical Officer of Health at the present time, according to the rate of increase of population in Fulham, it will be necessary to appoint an additional Medical Officer of Health, with whole time, every nine years. Should the Vestry in the future find that the duties appertaining to the office of Medical Officer of Health are not being satisfactorily carried out on account of sufficient time not being devoted to the performance of the duties or other cause, they will not hesitate to make a change in the duties of such officer, Art. 12 of the Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1891, so as to require him to devote his whole time to the duties of this office, and in the event of his not acquiescing thereon, to determine his appointment. But the Vestry are of opinion that the time has not yet arrived for them to require their Medical Officer of Health to devote his whole time to the duties of the office. At the meeting of the Vestry of the 22nd June, 1892, It was Resolved:— That, having considered letter from the Local Government Board enclosing copy of letter from Mr. T. Weatherley, with reference to the re-appointment of Medical Officer of Health, the Clerk be instructed to forward extracts from the minutes of the Vestry in reference to the re-appointment of Medical Officer of Health to the Local Government Board, and further, that the Local Government Board be informed that the Vestry in no way agree with the observations of Mr. T. Weatherley, and do hereby confirm the resolution of the Vestry of May 24th, 1892, the view therein expressed being the result of most careful and deliberate consideration of the Vestry for some time past. On the 3rd August, 1892, the Clerk read a letter from the Local Government Board, in which they stated, that while they regretted that the Vestry had not seen fit to appoint a person to devote his 26 whole time to the duties of the office, they had decided to offer no further objections to the proposed arrangements, and accordingly consented to the re-appointment of Dr. Cooney, and approved of the payment to him of a salary at the rate of £400 per annum for his services. On the 9th November, 1892, the Law and ParliamenPark Road. tary Committee reported as follows, viz.:— That having considered a reference made to us by the Sanitary Committee with regard to a letter of complaint re houses 30 to 40 Moore Park Road, which this Committee were requested to investigate, we report and recommend:— That the authorship of the letter having been acknowledged by the Medical Officer of Health, the Vestry do accept the ample apology made by him for it, and further state that the Medical Officer of Health agreed to tender a written apology to Mr. Warne in the matter. After a very long discussion it was ultimately decided to appoint a Committee of the whole Vestry, to enquire into the whole of the proceedings concerning the Medical Officer of Health. On 23rd November, 1892, the Special Committee reported:— That the Vestry find that the removal of Dr. J. Edwin Cooney from the office of Medical Officer of Health of this Parish, is necessary, in the general interests of the district and because of his misconduct, that he is hereby requested to resign the office of Medical Officer within a month from this date ; and that in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section 108, sub-section 2, clause "b," representation of the complaints against Dr. Cooney be made to the Local Government Board and their assent be asked as to the course adopted by the Vestry. Provided that the Local Government Board be further informed, that if their Honourable Board are of the opinion that it is more desirable that a public enquiry should be held by them at the Town Hall, Fulham, into the charges against Dr. Cooney, the Vestry would offer no objection to their so doing. Which report after considerable discussion was carried on a division by 37 to 16, and as an original motion by 46 to 1. The Special Committee also presented for adoption by the Vestry, the representation to be made to the Local Government Board, which was approved. 27 On the 13th December 1892, the Clerk read the following letter from the Local Government Board, viz. Whitehall, S.W., 7th December, 1892. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 25th ultimo and the 2nd instant with reference to the proceedings of Dr. J. E. Cooney as Medical Officer of Health for the Parish of Fulham. I am directed to state that the Board think it desirable that, in the first instance, the specific circumstances which have led the Vestry to request the Board to assent to Dr. Cooney's resignation of the above-mentioned office being required, should be stated in a more definite form. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, (Signed) WILL. E. KNOLLYS, W. J. H. Denselow, Esq., Assistant Secretary. Clerk to the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. And it was Resolved:— That the resolution and representation passed by the Vestry on the 23rd November, 1892, be referred to the Solicitor to prepare in a definite form in accordance with the letter from the the Local Government Board. On the 19th December, 1892, the Solicitor presented the ment prepared by him which was sealed and ordered to be forwarded to the Local Government Board. suspension of At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 18th January, 1893. It was moved by Mr. Lawrence and seconded by Mr. G. Williams:— "That having further considered the matter, together with letter from the Local Government Board, asking for the Vestry's observations on a letter from Mr. W. Firth, the tenant of No. 21, Tournay Road, complaining of the inaction of the Vestry and its officials, and having also considered the report of the Medical Officer of Health on the subject, your Committee have given the Solicitor and Clerk instructions as to preparing the Vestry's observations for consideration at an adjourned meeting of this Committee, to be held on Tuesday, the 17th January, at 7 p.m., and recommend that Dr. J. Edwin Cooney be suspended from the office of Medical Officer of Health pending the decision of the Local Government Board. After a long discussion the motion was carried by 32 votes to 24, when a division was claimed when there voted : Forr the motion, 33; against, 26. 28 The motion was therefore declared carried, and on the same date the Vestry adopted a Supplemental Report from the Sanitary Committee, recommending that Inspector Croucher should be censured by the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, and also submitting the Vestry's observations on the letter from the Local Government Board, re 21, Tournay Road. Resignation of. on the 15th February, 1893, the Clerk read the following letter from Dr. J. Edwin Cooney, resigning his position as Medical Officer of Health for Fulham :— Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W. February 10th, 1893. Sir, As you are aware, the Sanitary Authority of Fulham having made certain allegations against me, and without waiting to hear the result of their representations to the Local Government Board, suspended me on the 18th January, 1893, on a frivolous charge, which even the Magistrate, by his action, shewed arose through no fault of mine, and which charge the Local Government Board have apparently considered so unimportant and unnecessary, that I have not even been troubled for my observations on or reply to such. After this unjustifiable action on the part of the Vestry, and after having waited for four weeks without having heard from the Local Government Board, before whom I have so completely defended myself against the previous allegations, there is no course open to me but to place this, my resignation, in the hands of the Vestry, as it would be impossible for me—who have been denied the barest justice by such body—to continue to serve as the Medical Officer of Health of Fulham in the interests of the public. I am, Sir, yours faithfully, (Signed) J. EDWIN COONEY, To the Clerk to the Medical Officer of Health of Fulham. Vestry of Fulham. It was Resolved by 28 votes to 2:— That Dr. J. Edwin Cooney's resignation be accepted by the Vestry, in accordance with the resolution passed by the Vestry on the 23rd day of November, 1892, with charges already formulated and sent to the Local Government Board, but the Vestry entirely disclaim the reasons set forth in the letter of resignation dated 10th February, 1893, and that a copy of such letter be forwarded to the Local Government Board for any observations they may wish to make thereon. 29 On the 1st March 1893, the Clerk read a letter from the Local Government Board as follows, viz. : Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. Sir 21st February, 1893. I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your tetter of the 16th, instant, and, in reply, to state that as Mr J. E Cooney has resigned his appointment as Medical Officer of Health for the Parish of Fulham, it does not appear to the Board necessary for them to offer any comments on his letter of the 10th instant. The Board request that the particulars of the appointment of a successor to Mr. Cooney in the above mentioned Office, may be communicated to them in one of the enclosed forms. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. J. H. Denselow, Esq., WILL. E. KNOLLEYS, Clerk to the Vestry of the Assistant Secretary. Parish of Fulham. TOWN HALL. Lettings.

Metropolis Management Rates. 25th March, 1893. We have this day examined the accounts of the Churchwardens and Oversoers, for the year ending 25th March, 1893. We find the balance due to the Overseers to be £200 14s. 10¼d., and note that the amount to bo collected for the last half-year was £42,807 2s. 10½d., but there was only a collectable amount of £463 8s. 10-½d. outstanding at the close of the Rates. We consider the manner in which the Rooks have been presented to us for Audit by Mr. Robinson, have most considerable diminished the duties devolving upon us, and we would further take the opportunity of expressing our appreciation of the most efficient manner in which Mr. Robinson carries out the duties of his office.

(Signed) A. G. Spells, Henry T. Harbison, William Darbyshire, . Auditors of Accounts for the Parish of Fulham. 39 40 Chemical Laboratory, 43 and 44, Holborn Viaduct, E.C., London, June 24th, 1893. To the Chairman and Members of the Fulham Vestry. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my report, as Analyst to the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, for the year ended on March 31st, 1893. During the year, one hundred and one samples of Food and Drugs were received by me for analysis. Of these samples, thirty-one were obtained by Mr. Inspector A. A. Croucher, thirty by Mr. Inspector W. H. Grrigg, and forty by Mr. Inspector C. B. Jones. The Surveyor to the Vestry, Mr. J. P. Norrington, A.M.I.C.E., also submitted to me for analysis one sample of white lead (date of receipt, May 6th, 1892), and two samples of creosote oil (dates, August 9th, 1892, and March 27th, 1893). The total number of samples analysed and reported on was therefore one hundred and four. Taking the population of Fulham, shown by the census of April, 1891, namely 91,(340, the number of samples obtained during the year, for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts, was equivalent to one sample for every 907 persons. The samples of food and drink comprised forty-nine of milk, nine of butter, twenty-four of coffee, two of cocoa, five of pepper, two of vinegar, three of port wine, and one each of gin, Scotch whiskey and Irish whiskey. The only drugs received for analysis were four samples of citrate of magnesia. Below (Table I), is a tabular statement of the numbers of the several articles submitted to analysis during the four quarters of the year:— TABLE I. Article Analysed. During First Quarter.

Remarks. As on the occasion of my report for the year ended on March 31st, 1892, I avail myself of the occasion to name some articles of food and drugs, samples of which might well be submitted to analysis from time to time. Among articles of food, bread, cheese, condensed milk, flour, oatmeal, lard, yeast, confectionery, tinned meats, meat extracts, pickles, sauces, olive oil, mustard, preserves, soda water, beer, rum and brandy; and among drugs, cream of tartar, precipitated sulphur, syrup of squill, syrup of poppies, syrup of senna, rhubarb, glycerine, paregoric, spirit of nitrous ether, compound liquorice powder, antimonial wine, wine of ipecacuanha, saffron, sal volatile, wine of quinine, tincture of quinine, ammoniated tincture of quinine, citrate of iron and quinine, mercury with chalk, Fowler's solution, fluid magnesia, solution of perchloride of iron and rectified spirit, occur to me as articles which might undergo investigation. From the 43 culars given in Tables I and II of this report, it will be seen that no samples were obtained for analysis during the fourth quarter of the year, ending March 31st, 1893; but I believe that arrangements have been made by which samples will in future be more regularly and systematically purchased for analysis. To the desirability of this I ventured to call attention in my report for the previous year. Apart from the punitive effect of the legal proceedings' in cases of proved adulteration, the moral influence of an organised system of periodical collection of samples (of all kinds of foods and drugs in common use) is doubtless distinctly protective to the inhabitants of a parish. And the practice, which is customary in some districts, of sending letters of caution to vendors of samples certified to be of a suspicious character, or of a poor or of an inferior quality, and of articles found to be slightly adulterated for the first time ("first offences"), might with advantage be adopted. The Annual Reports of the Local Government Board show that but little advantage is taken of the clause of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 187"), by which private purchasers are enabled to submit samples to Public Analysts: thus, of the 29,028 samples analysed throughout England and Wales during the year 1891, all but 177 were taken by officers of local authorities. No samples coming under this clause have been submitted to me during the year ending March 31st, 1893. It is satisfactory to observe that the proportion of adulterated to total samples analysed (all articles together) during the year ended on March 31st, 1893, as shown by Table II, is much lower than in the preceding year; but due regard must be had to the circumstance that the total number of samples examined in 1892-93 was very considerably less than in 1891-92. Had the total number for 1892-93 been greater, a very different ratio might have resulted; and the value of the comparison between the two years is thus somewhat discounted. Nevertheless, the figures are clearly indicative of a decided improvement, as regards purity, with respect to several of the articles examined. This applies especially to milk and coffee, of each of which a considerable number of samples received attention ; also, in some degree, to butter, of which, however, fewer samples were analysed. The improvement in the case of coffee was so marked, that reference was made to it in my quarterly report, dated December, 31st, 1892. Further remarks on this subject will be found below. Milk.—Of the forty-nine samples of milk submitted to analysis, three samples were certified to be adulterated, and eight samples were reported to be of poor or inferior quality. The proportions of added water in the samples returned as adulterated were, respectively, 18, 26 and 42 per cent.; and the sample containing 42 per cent. of extraneous water had also been deprived of 42 per cent. of fat. it is probable that some of the samples described as "poor" or inferior were not free from sophistication: but as Public Analysts are compelled, by circumstances beyond their control, to form conclusions 44 from calculations based on very low limits of quality, it is not possible to return samples of this class as adulterated. The addition of water, and removal of fat, continue to be the customary forms of milk adulteration; but other substances than water, such as starch and sugar, are occasionally added ; and the use of one or another preparation of boracic acid, introduced as a preservative, is prevalent; though much difference of opinion exists as to whether boracic acid should or should not be regarded as an adulteration. It is evident that a distinct improvement may be recorded in the quality of the milk vended in the Parish of Fulham, for the year ending March 31st, 1893, as compared with the previous year. This may be explained partly by the greater adequacy of the fines imposed, in most of the cases of food adulteration, particulars of which have been given in Table IV. It may be remeiiiembered that in my report for the year ending 31st March, 1892, attention was drawn to the smallness of the fines so often inflicted, and to the remarks upon this subject in the Report of the Local Government Board. It is pleasant to be able to record that, in at least two cases, the samples of milk submitted to me were above the average in point of quality. Butter.—Only nine samples of butter were subjected to analysis, but it is satisfactory to be in a position to state that all were genuine and of fair quality. As far as a judgment can be based upon this somewhat small number of samples, there is here an improvement as compared with the previous year. Coffee.—Of the twenty-four samples of coffee examined, two were certified to be adulterated with chicory, the quantities of the extraneous ingredient being 10 and 55 parts respectively. These results may be fairly compared with those for the preceding twelve months, during which period twenty-nine samples of coffee were analysed, no less than eight of which were adulterated ; and more than 50 per cent, of chicory was present in most of the adulterated samples. Here, then, is a very marked improvement indeed, the proportion of adulterated to total samples being, for 1892-93, less than one-third of that for 1891-92 (v. Table II : of. Table II, lieport for 1891-92.) Cocoa.—The two samples of cocoa submitted to analysis contained large proportions of added starch and sugar : but proceedings were successful in one instance only (Table IV). Vinegar.—One of the two samples of vinegar was certified to contain an insufficient amount of acetic acid: the quantity present was, in fact, only 2½ per cent., or less than half of the per centage of acetic acid which " vinegar" contains, according to the British Pharmacopoeia. 45 Citrate of Magnesia.-All the samples of this drug were found to contain unduly large propotions of sugar; quantities so great, indeed as to interfere with the effervescent property of the mixturethe samples were therefore considered to be not of the nature, substance and quality of the article demanded by the purchaser. The rest of the samples of food were certified to be genuine, and need not be further referred to. Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875) and Margarine Act (1887) Amendment Bill No. 213). In a separate report dated April 25th, 1893, I have already dealt with the merits and demerits of this Bill, which is a modification of, and in some respects an improvement upon the " Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875) Amendment Bill" (No. 1(58), to which I called the attention of the Vestry in my report, dated June 10th, 1892, for the year ended on March 31st, 1892. In conclusion, I would acknowledge the courtesy uniformly extended to me by all the officials of the Vestry with whom I have been in communication.

LOAN SCHEDULE. During the past year no application for a Loan for Scheduled works was made to the London County Council, but on last year's Schedule the Council has granted Loans to the amount of £2,600, being less than one half of the amount applied for. HAMMERSMITH VESTRY. During the year 1892-93, the total sum of £541 17s. 4d. has been paid to the above Vestry, being for the year's superannuations to retired officials of the late Fulham District Board of Works, and for part maintenance of Hammersmith Road. LOCAL TAXATION RETURNS. Under 23 and 24 Victoria, c. 51, and 40 and 41 Victoria, c. 66, it is enacted that every Vestry, District Board, &c., shall make a return annually of the sums levied or received by or in interest of rates, taxes, &c., and of the expenditure thereof, to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State. Under the above Acts, the Statistical Department of the Local Government Board issue, during the month of July in each year, a form embracing the various heads of receipts and expenditure, and of loans, &c., employed by local authorities. In July, 1892, forms (in duplicate) for the Local Taxation Returns were received by this Vestry, and referred to me to fill up. This was duly done, and on my presenting same to the Finance Committee, they instructed the Clerk to return the form to the Local Government Board. 55 PRECEPTS OF CORPORATE BODIES. The Central Boards issuing precepts on the Vestry were the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London; now the latter only, as the precept of the London County Council the successors of the late Metropolitan Board of Works, is made on the Guardians of Fulham Union, and so becomes chargeable on the Poor Rate instead of the Local Rates, as was formerly the case with the Consolidated Rate. The following statement will show the amounts paid by the Fulham Parish through the late District Board, the Fulhani Vestry, &c., to the Metropolitan Board, over which they had no direct control.

This is chargeable on the General Rate, and is equal to a rate of 10¼d. in the £, the amount being an increase of £390 9s. Od. on the previous year's precept, and allowing for an increase in the rateable value of £25,535, as against the increase last year of £41,144, the Vestry are enabled—in the face of the increase in the amount of the precept, and decrease in the amount of the extra assessments—to decrease the rate by ¼d. in the £ on that of 1891-92.

With reference to the New Streets Accounts, during the nast year, there has been received the sum of £19,747 6s. 2d. on account of Apportionments made The amounts still due by contributors are—on old Roads, transferred to this Vestry by the late District Board of Works, the sum of 4130 11s. 10d. and oJthe to by this v estry during the past six years the sum of £15,075 6s 2d making the total due on New Streets to be £15, 205 18s. 0d.'' " Statements of New Streets Account in detail will be found at the end of the Accounts. Since the incorporation of the Vestry of Fulham, in March, 1886, there have been sealed 236 original apportionments for "New Streets'' Paving and Sewering works, amounting to £129,856 6s. 5d., of this number, eighteen have been declared bad and irrecoverable through sundry causes, by the magistrates, and the apportionments thereon amounting to £11,228 14s. 2d., have been rescinded, and where money had been paid by contributors, it was refunded in full, of this number eight have been re-apportioned, and works proceeded with. Of the 224 good apportionments, the works have been completed in 182 cases, with the result that the estimate was exceeded in 45 cases, necessitating the sealing of additional apportionments to the amount of £2,949 4s. 0d., while in 124 cases the estimate was more than sufficient and allowed a return to be made to the owners of £12,251 3s. 1d., and in the remaining 13 cases, the estimate just covered the actual cost of the works. To show the magnitude of the New Streets work, and that the property of the Fulham Parish is not held by a few individuals, I may mention that the details of the numerous apportionments, &c., necessitated the opening of some 5,000 ledger accounts, entailing a large amount of clerical labour. LABOUR, &c—WAGES ACCOUNT. The Parishioners will form some idea of the rapid development of the Parish by the comparative statement of the Labour Wages Accounts for 1886 and that of 1893. On the 27th day of January, 1886, the Vestry passed the following resolution, on the recommendation of the Works Committee.

We, the undersigned Auditors of the Accounts of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, for the financial year ending 25th March, 1893, hereby certify that we have examined the books of the Vestry, and have compared the vouchers with the cheques, and we find the balance of £ s. d. 10378 7 3 at the Bankers on Current and Deposit Accounts to be correct, and, allowing for the outstanding cheques, amounting to 924 19 2 the balance to be £9453 8 1 We have also examined the Loan Account of the Vestry, and we find that the Loans, including £24200 borrowed during the year amount to £91782 17 4 We note that £15,205 18s. 0d. is due from contributors on New Streets, of which we observe £3,523 0s. 5d. is due on streets completed and that on the whole a large proportion of the amount is due from a few owners, and we think that some strong steps should be taken to get in these outstanding amounts. We see that the Vestry have paid £594 7s. 3d. for disinfecting goods during the past year and we think the time has arrived when the Vestry should build for the parish a disinfecting apparatus, as we are of the opinion that a great saving would result thereby. We have much pleasure in stating that the accounts have been kept in a very satisfactory manner and presented to us much earlier than usual, and must thank Mr. R. H. Meyer the Accountant and other officers of the Vestry for the courteous manner in which they have assisted us during the audit. Signed A. G. Spells, Henry T. Harrison, William Darbydhire, Auditors.

SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR, FOR THE YEAR 1892-93. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of presenting to yon my Seventh Annual Report on the works executed by my department, for the year commencing on the '25th March, 1892, and ending on the 25th March, 1893. As in my former reports, the corresponding figures for the previous years are retained in the tabulated statements. Many of the schedules are placed in the manner adopted last year at the end of the Report. As many of the recommendations in my previous reports have not yet been acted upon, I have again repeated them. Those, therefore, who are acquainted with my previous reports must excuse this repetition, and I again ask their assistance in rendering it unnecessary. AREA OF THE PARISH. The area of the Parish of Fulham is 1700.324 acres Area of Foreshore 56.561 „ Area of Tidal Water 99.614 „ Total 1,856.499 COMPARATIVE TABLE.

The traffic in the district continues to increase enormously. ASPHALTE AND TAB PAYING. Tar paving has been laid around the Recreation Ground and the paths outside in the Crown and Fulham Palace Roads, also in the Rylston Road, the only asphalte required has been for repairs to trenches made by the Gas and Water Companies.

The Vestry, however, on the 14th September, 1892, ordered the matter to stand over for six months. Owing to the increasingly bad state of the road, two efforts were made without success by members of the Vestry to have this resolution rescinded, and in February, 1893, large patches of the wood came up and the holes had to be filled in with macadam. On the 1st of February, 1893, instructions were given for plans and specification to be prepared for paving the Crown Road, from the Police Station to the Fulham Palace Road, and on the 1st March tenders for doing the work were received, the lowest being £1,650. On the 22nd March, the Works Committee passed a recommendation that the portions of Sherbrook and Rylston Roads, much used by omnibuses be wood-paved. At a largely attended meeting of the Association of Incorporated Municipal and County Engineers, held at the Bishop's Meadow, on the 4th March, the following paper was read on the use of Western Australian Woods, Karri and Jarrah for woo paving. 142 Mr. President and Members of the Association of Municipal Engineers and Surveyors, The expenditure on the paving of streets is so considerable, that any information which can be laid before this Association in reference to materials that can be economically used for such work, will no doubt be welcomed. The Vestry of this parish has alone spent £36,542 2s. 6d. on 74,370 square yards of wood paving during the last seven years, and further large sums will have to be spent shortly for new works and repaving. The present practice is to use creosoted deal blocks, costing about 12s. a yard, including 6" of Portland cement concrete underneath, these blocks being on account of their greater durability, cheaper and more sanitary than plain deal blocks. In June, 1889, a trial strip of Jarrah was laid in Lillie Road, 6' 6" wide. This strip is now after 3½ years' wear,½' ¾" and 1" above the plain deal blocks adjoining, although four of the Jarrah blocks show signs of wear or decay to the extent of 3/8", ¾" and 7/8"; also in February, 1892, about 542 square yards of Jarrah wood were laid in Jerdan Place, at the cost of 19s. per square yard. Karri wood (Eucalyptus diversicolor) is abundant in Western Australia, growing in forests intermixed with Jarrah and Red Gum, and can be delivered at our wharf, close to Putney Bridge, in blocks 9" by 3" by 4" deep, at a cost of 185s. per 1,000. This wood does not appear to have been known in this country except to a very few persons until the end of 1892, and it is possible that some of it has already been laid under the name of Jarrah. Jarrah wood (Eucalyptus marginata) also growing as above, can be delivered at our wharf, in blocks 9" by 3" by 4" deep, at a cost of 207s. 6d. per 1,000. This wood has already been considerably used for wood paving for some years in London. The blocks of both these woods at the prices quoted are guaranteed 4" deep, but not precisely 9" long or 3" wide although 1,000 of them would cover a larger area than a 1,000 exactly the size specified. The slight variation is due to imperfect sawing arrangements in Australia. At higher prices they can both be delivered the precise size required. The woods belong to the same class of tree, and appear from the plan of the forests which have been shown to me to grow side by side. Their appearance is very similar, and their similarity would also probably extend to their durability, and to the special immunity from decay which has been claimed on their behalf. As far as the experiments hereafter referred to have extended, one great difference appears to be that Karri sinks in water and Jarrah floats, showing Karri to be denser. Great virtue is claimed for Eucalyptus oil,—prepared from a tree of the same class (Eucalyptus Globulus)—as an antiseptic, and it has occurred to me that perhaps the lasting properties of these woods may be to some extent due to the presence of this oil. 143 The following information is placed in a tabular from for purposes of comprison.

The author calls attention to the extraordinary expansion of the creosoted blocks. No doubt these blocks lost a great deal of creosote during the weeks they remained in a warm room, and perhaps the pressure they had been subjected to in the cylinder during the creosting process in some way accounts for their greater expansion. Considerable feeling appears to exist in Australia as to the relative capabilities of the two woods, Karri and Jarrah, and a Commission on the subject was appointed in 1887, which arrived at the following conclusions:— CONCLUSIONS ARRIVED AT BY THE COMMISSION. 1. It is very certain that the usefulness and durability of both timbers depends very much upon the locality where grown, and the season of the year in which it is felled. The Commission consider that from November to May or June, or when the sap is down, is the best time to undertake this work; this applies equally to Jarrah or Karri. 2. From the lengthened tests and life in works to which Jarrah has been subjected, it appears to be a timber suitable for piles in marine structures. Karri piles, as compared with Jarrah, can scarcely be regarded as having passed the experimental stage ; and the Commission would suggest that a series of experiments be commenced and continued year by year with both timbers under exactly similar conditions, careful inspection being made from time to time, and true records kept. 3. From the evidence appended, it appears that the advantages of Karri over Jarrah are:—That piles can be obtained of greater lengths, straighter, they drive better and resist a heavier strain. For the superstructure of bridges, jetties, &c., or where severe strains or crushing weight has to be considered, Karri, in consequence of its greater strength (see appended Tables), should be preferred and used before Jarrah. 4. It does not appear from the evidence before the Commission that there is much to choose between the two timbers as far as their anti-resisting properties are concerned. 5. From the evidence before the Commission, and the appended Tables of Tests, we are of opinion that Karri is most suitable for works of construction, railways, and public works generally ; but as regards the timber resisting the action of salt water and sea worms in marine works it has yet to be proved. 6. It appears, from structures that have been examined, and from the evidence taken, that, as a general rule, round piles should be used in preference to square, and they should be charred and tarred before being driven.

Joseph Harris, J.P., Inspector of Forests, 145 TEST OP KARRI AND JARRAH AS WOOD PAVING In July, 1888, strips of Karri and Jarrah were laid side by side in the King's Road, in front of Messrs. Ransome's premises. These blocks were all exactly 5" deep, and Messrs. Ransome have kindly shown me samples which have been retained by them The Karri blocks were wide, and the Jarrah 2 7/8" These blocks have been down now 4½ years without being disturbed, and Mr. T. W. Higgens the Surveyor of Chelsea, writes me that the Karri is a quarter of an inch above the Jarrah, and the Jarrah is about three quarters above the yellow deal. On the 14th day of December, 1892, the importers of Karri wrote this Vestry, saying that they would be prepared to guarantee that 4" Karri blocks shall last twice as long as the deal blocks (laid in July, 1885, in the Fulham Road), which are not yet taken up, though in a very bad condition. Judging from the blocks in the King's Road the offer appears a safe one, and in the following Table the duration of Karri wood is calculated at 16 years. The importers also claim that a 3½" wood block is equal to a 4" Jarrah. In a report to my Vestry, dated the 11th day of January, 1893, the following Table and conclusions appeared showing the relative cost of using the woods named Table III.

Karri is cheaper than Jarrah. 2. Table I. shows Karri to be generally superior to Jarrah, and the equal or superior of all the other woods given in the Table. The fact that Lloyd's already class both woods as nearly equal to leak is a strong certificate in their favour. 3. Both woods belong to the same class, and probably possess a natural oil in some degree equivalant in its action to the creosote forced into the deal blocks. 4. The Kings Road experiment shows Karri to be more durable as a paving material than Jarrah, 5 Table II. shows Karri and Jarrah to be both cheaper in the end than creosoted deal, and Karri the cheaper of the two. 146 6. A hard wood road is superior to a soft wood road for sanitary reasons, as it throws off the wet better, and is dryer and cleaner. 7. If the harder woods are used, the disturbance of traffic, &c., caused by repeated relaying and repairs will be reduced to the minimum. The London County Council have already offered to lend money for Jarrah wood paving for seven years to the St. George's Vestry instead of five years, which is the usual term for which loans are granted for wood paving works. If the London Surveyors would combine, no doubt the Council could be induced to lend money for paving with these hard woods for terms of ten or twelve years, which, at present prices, would make the annual cost of hard wood paving much lighter than deal. One objection raised to the hard wood roadways is that they are more slippery than deal. It is admitted that they are cleaner, and as slipperiness is generally the result of dirt, proper scavenging should obviate the complaint. A further objection is that the hard woods wear, as Mr. C. Mason, the Surveyor of the St. Martin's Vestry, describes it in a letter to me, like "ripples on a sea shore." In order to overcome this tendency, the wood paving in Jerdan Place is laid quite close jointed, and I suggest that this tendency can be further overcome by laying the lines of wood diagonally across the road. In conclusion, I suggest that when Surveyors are desirous of obtaining blocks for wood paving, they should obtain alternative prices for Karri and Jarrah. This course will enable them to obtain the benefit of the competition for the supply of these woods. JAMES P. NORRINGTON, A.M.I.C.E., Surveyor to the Vestry of Fulham.

Total 3,345 149 The subject of the cleansing and ventilation of the sewers has received a good deal of attention from the Vestry during the year, and it will be seen that no less a sum than £422 6s. 3d. was spent for water alone for flushing the sewers during the period. Acting on the instructions of the Vestry , on the 8th October, 1892, I prepared a report on the sewers in the district, a copy of which is appended. The report included a table giving the length, depth, size, number of ventilators, distance apart of same, and other particulars, in reference to the sewer in every street in the district. As this is of course very lengthy and can always be referred to at my office, I have not repeated it in this report. The Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. Town Hall, Fulham, October 8th, 1892. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of Fulham. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, REPORT ON THE SEWERS IN THIS DISTRICT. Having been instructed by a resolution of the Vestry, passed on the 3rd of August, 1892, to report on the sewers in the Parish. I beg to point out that, although I propose to condense the report as much as possible, it will necessarily be somewhat lengthy. Many details have also been unavoidably omitted, which can be easily supplied to any committee dealing with the report. I propose first to give some particulars relating to the sewers of Fulham generally, then to supply a detailed descriptive list of all the sewers in the Parish, adding recommendations where desirable. Much of the information, and many of the suggestions in this report have already appeared in former Reports to the Vestry, but as all of these suggestions have not been fully carried out, they are repeated here. area and population. The area of Fulham is 1700.324 acres (exclusive of foreshore and tidal water), and the population is estimated to be at the present time 97,730. ownership of sewers, &c. The sewers belonging to this Vestry discharge into the Western sewer, belonging to the London County Council. is sewer conducts the sewage from Hammersmith through the Fu am a ace Road, Dawes Road, Harwood Road, Imperial Road, and the Gas Company's Works into Chelsea, where it also receives the whole of the sewage of Chelsea, and from a great part of Kensington. 150 It discharges at the Victoria Pumping Station on the Chelsea Embankment, where the whole of the sewage is lifted up 20-ft. by four engines, working eight pumps, into the Low Level Sewer, which follows the course of the Victoria Embankment. These pumps raised 9,322,551,110 gallons of sewage in 1891, the lowest daily record being 14,627,000 gallons, and the highest, 54,795,000. The sewer running through High Street, Church Street, and the King's Road, joining the Western Sewer in Broxholme Road, also belongs.to the London County Council. All other sewers in the district belong to the Vestry, and have been laid either by the Vestry or private persons, and handed over to the Vestry. It will be seen from the above that the Vestry has not full control over the sewers of the district, and I shall shew that their condition is very much dependent on the state of the main Western sewer. level of parish. Surcharging of Sewers. The level of the surface of this Parish is only a few feet above Thames high water mark, consequently this Western sewer, which has to receive the sewage of Fulham and Hammersmith, is itself many feet below high water level, and in times of heavy rain it becomes surcharged to such an extent, that on Sunday, August 28th, 1892, the water from the sewers flooded the cellars of a great number of places in the district to various depths, including the basement of the Town Hall, to a depth of 6 inches (list given hereafter). I am informed that 1.51 inches of rainfall took place on that day, that the worst of the fall occurred at high water, so that the storm overflows could not be opened; and that it occupied 19 hours for the four large engines, previously referred to, at the Victoria Pumping Station, to raise the sewage into the Low Level sewer. This gradual pumping away of the sewage, extending over so long a period, must cause a large deposit in all the sewers of the district. The Vestry will therefore see that this flooding is by far the most important draw-back to the condition of their sewers, besides being one entirely beyond their control. The following letter on the above subject was written to the London County Council on the 28th November, 1891:— letter ON surcharging to london county council. Dear Sir, "I am directed by the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham to ask you to lay the following information before the Main Drainage Committee:— On the 11th November, the Claybrooke Road sewer was surcharged, so that the water rose 3-ft. in the manholes, 151 This was due to the surcharging of the Western sewer, which passes through the Fulham Palace Road and Dawes Road. This sewer was charged to within 13-ft. of the surface of the roadway, or about 8-ft above the crown of the sewer. It was also found that the nearest ventilator in the Fulham Palace Road, to the end of Claybrooke Eoad sewer, was stopped up, so that the ventilator in Claybrooke Road acted as a ventilator to the Fulham Palace Road sewer. Acting under the instructions of the Vestry, I wrote you on 30th July last, calling the attention of the Council to the inadequacy of this Western sewer, and stating that, on the 26th July, the sewer was surcharged to the heigth of 9-ft. 6-ins. above the crown, causing the Colehill Lane sewer, belonging to the Vestry, and situate at a distance of 2,400 feet away, to be surcharged. You replied to that on the 5th October, stating that the "Council's officers did not remember any flooding of houses," and that under existing conditions the capacity of the sewer appears to be sufficient. With respect to the flooding of houses, I beg to inform you that shortly after my appointment in 1886,1 received a complaint of certain basements of the houses in the Broadway, Walham Green, being flooded to a depth of 6-ins.; since that date I have received repeated complaints of these cellars being flooded, and on the 19th July last they were again flooded to about the same level. I have also received complaints of flooding of cellars of houses in Hatfield Street out of Field Road. With respect to the capacity of the sewer, I beg to state that the Western sewer in this District is surcharged at every heavy rainfall. It is manifest that when such surcharging takes place the subsidence of the sewage in the sewers of the District must be very gradual; (I have been informed that it has takes 10 hours to raise the sewage from this Western sewer into the Low Level sewer) and that such gradual subsidence must lead to large deposits of solid matter in the sewers. The statements contained in this letter my Vestry consider indisputable, and it consequently fails to see that the Council can consider either the capacity of the sewers in the Parish, or the pumping power at the Victoria Pumping Station adequate. This Vestry further trusts that your Council will give this matter the serious consideration which its importance merits, especially having regard to the enormous growth of this and neighbouring Parishes." I remain, yours faithfully, JAMES P. NORRINGTON, H. De La Hooke, Esq., Surveyor to the Vestry. Clerk to the Council, * 152 defects of sewers. Change in opinion as to method of construction of Sewers. The other drawbacks are of a less important character, and many are within the control of the Vestry, they may be briefly summed up as occasioned by insufficient ventilation of the sewers belonging to the London County Council, defective construction, damaged sewers, insufficient fall, dead ends, want of ventilation, inadequate flushing, and in this district the use of peat moss litter. As the plans and sections shewing the size, level, and fall of all the sewers in the district have been submitted and approved by the Metropolitan Board, the London County Council and Yestry, nearly all these sewers have been constructed under proper supervision, there are not, therefore, many that can be said to be defectively constructed or to want proper fall, but in former days such things as numerous ventilators, flushing chambers, &c., were not considered necessary; and many of the oldest sewers, such as those belonging to the London County Council, although most carefully constructed, have the least ventilation. As illustrating the change of opinion on these subjects, many engineers, if constructing an entirely new system of sewers, would now adopt the dual or separate system, keeping the rainfall distinct from the sewage. In 1886 I reported on these matters and made the following recommendations:— RECOMMENDATIONS IN 1886. "Fall of Sewers.—That particular attention be paid to the fall of sewers. Manholes and Ventilation of Dead Ends.—That manholes and ventilators be provided at all dead ends, and that they be connected with the nearest adjoining sewer by a 9-in. pipe Steam and Obnoxious Matters.—That steam should not be allowed to be discharged into the sewers, or any obnoxious matter from factories, unless it has been previously specially treated and deodorised. Manholes.—That a 2-ft square manhole cover with a ventilating area of 62 square inches, be placed on all the manholes which are now covered with an iron plate. Surface Ventilators 60 y&rds apart.—That surface ventilators be fixed to all old sewers not more than 60 yards apart. Best Lamps as Ventilators.—That all rest lamps be used as ventilating shafts. Special Shafts.—That special ventilating pipes or shafts be erected wherever practicable. Flushing.—That the present system of flushing be continued; that the owners of courts and other properties be encouraged to have their private drains flushed, and that the Vestry undertake to do the work on payment of a small fee. 153 Catchpits to Ventilators.— That all ventilators be provided with an arrangement to prevent dirt passing through them into the sewers. Flushing Tanks, &c.-That flushing tanks, shafts with fires in them, or connected with factory shafts, shafts with cowls on top, and special deodorizers can be used with great benefit in special cases, and that such special cases be dealt with indi vidually as they arise, The above recommendations have been repeated from time to time, some hundreds of new ventilators have been fixed, special attention has been given to cleansing and flushing, and of course all sewers constructed during the last six years, about 10 miles in length, have been constructed on these lines. In the third special report of the Medical Officer of Health he states that the sewers in the District, constructed during recent years, "are all that can be desired."

All streets in the list of those not yet taken to, can and should be dealt with at the time the street is made up by the Contractors, previous to being taken over by the Vestry. Roads with no sewers in at present are not mentioned in this Report, as the Vestry is in the habit of dealing with these as occasion arises. ANSELM ROAD. The Anselm Road sewer will be extended in the future, when additional ventilation, &c., will be provided. BARCLAY ROAD. Barclay Road sewer is exceedingly well ventilated, but many complaints are received of these ventilators. It joins the Fulham Road close to the junction of the Dawes Road sewer belonging to the London County Council. The Vestry receives numerous complaints of this Dawes Road sewer, which is badly ventilated, and I think the gases from the Dawes Road escape through the Barclay Road ventilators. There is one ventilating shaft in the Barclay Road, and an offer has been made to allow another to be fixed. I recommend this offer being accepted. BROUGHTON ROAD. This sewer is well ventilated, and in good condition, complaints have been received of the ventilators smelling, and I recommend shafts being erected where this occurs. WANDSWORTH BRIDGE ROAD. The construction of a new sewer in the Wandsworth Bridge Road, which is absolutely necessary, will relieve all the sewers in that district. The following report concerning this sewer was entered on the Minutes on the 9th September, 1891. "I beg to report that the sewer to the Wandsworth Bridge Road, which is 3,880-ft. long, with a gradient of 1 in '287, is only a 15-in. pipe. This sewer has running into it at the present time 330-ft. in length of 15-in. pipe, and 4065-ft. in length of 12-in. pipe sewers. "In a few years time about 9,000-ft. of additional sewers will in all probability have to drain into it." "In dry weather this sewer runs quite half full, and in wet weather it is surcharged." "On the 30th day of June last, the water backed up into the sewer being laid in Cresford Road." "Mr. Jones informs me that this sewer was laid with the idea of being only sufficient to take the surface drainage of the roadway." "Taking into consideration the enormous amount discharging into it and the great number of new houses and new streets that will ultimately drain into it, am of opinion that it is necessary to construct a new brick sewer in place of the present 15-in. pipe." 156 "The outfall will be the brick sewer in King's Eoad, 4.ft. 6-in. by 3-ft." " My estimate of the cost of the new sewer is £3,500, and the necessary plans have been commenced." north end road sewer. Many complaints are received of offensive odours arising from the ventilators of this sewer, which brings through the whole length of the North End Road the sewage from a great part of Hammersmith, and joins the Harwood Road at Walham Green:— This sewer is insufficiently ventilated, the present distance apart of ventilators averaging 348-ft., whereas I have always recommended them being placed from 180 to 200-ft. apart. A portion of the sewer is, as the Vestry had pointed out by a section submitted to them in 1888, depressed from the end of Talgarth Eoad to Gibb's Green. The current through this portion in dry weather is at the rate of a mile and a half an hour, which is equal to 2.2 feet per second, and twice as rapid a flow as a 12-in. pipe sewer, ¾ full with a fall of 1 in 100. This part of the sewer has never failed to do its duty, and the flow is sufficient to keep the sewer clear, although there is a deposit of clean grit and sand at the bottom of the depressed portion. I do not propose to rccommend the Vestry to re-construct this portion of the sewer until I have an opportunity of examining it in detail. This can only be done by constructing a flushing chamber and penstock just above the depressed portion, the sewer can then be entered, the condition of it examined, and it can also be cleared periodically. A chamber and penstock can be constructed at a cost of ±'60, and I recommend the work to be carried out at once. Additional ventilators should also be constructed at suitable distances, and shafts erected wherever possible. As this, however, drains two Parishes, the London County Council might be approached with a view of their taking over the control of it as a main sewer, but the work recommended should not be delayed on that account. vernon street. An old barrel drain in Vernon Street which discharges into a 12-in. pipe should be at once taken up and a 12-in. pipe substituted. lettice street. There are six dead ends in this street, each of which should have a manhole and ventilator. farm lane, star lane, & north end road. I recommend that the Eoad Car Company should be requested to provide a grating and catchpit to their drains to prevent the peat 157 moss litter entering these Sewers as this litter is to a large extent responsible for the sewers smelling offensively, and it causes considerable extra trouble and expense in cleansing them eli & mund streets.

There is a ventilating shaft at the junction of this sewer and the North End Road, which should be altered to a manhole to give easier access to the sewer. simultaneous flushing. I again recommend that arrangements be made for householders to flush the drains of their houses simultaneously at 11 o'clock in the morning, also that the County Council be asked to arrange for flushing in Hammersmith the sewers that pass through Fulham. shafts & cowls. I also recommend that wherever upright shafts are fixed cowls be placed upon them, so that the force of the wind will create a current from the sewer and assist ventilation. anemometer. I recommend that I be allowed to purchase an anemometer so as to be enabled to make tests in reference to the ventilation of sewers. new streets. I further recommend that before new streets are apportioned a special examination be made of the sewer, and that any improvements which can be made in the ventilation be made before the street is taken over. conclusion. In conclusion I again strongly recommend that continued efforts be made to induce the London County Council to increase the necessary pumping power, or otherwise to facilitate the discharge o e sewage of the district, also to increase the ventilation or by other means to improve the condition of their Sewers in this distric .

HARRIS REEVES' PROPOSAL Be DEODORIZATION OF SEWAGE, NORTH END ROAD. I have been asked to report on the proposal made by Mr. R. H. Reeves to deodorize the sewage flowing through the North End Road sewer in this district. proposal. His suggestion is to fix in some of the manholes of this sewer a number of automatic apparatus for applying nianganate of soda and sulphuric acid (which, I am informed, is a similar but stronger preparation than Condy's Fluid) to the sewage. experience at frome. The system appears to have been working at Frome for some years in a satisfactory manner, and Mr. Phillip Edinger, the Surveyor to the Frome Local Board, writes—" That we have had them in use several seasons, and at every manhole in which they have been fixed no smell has been complained of from the open gratings; while in other parts of the town we are obliged to close those manholes not having the system in or near them." My first enquiries have been made with a view of ascertaining how far the chemicals adopted by Mr. Reeves would effect the proposed object. reports by metropolitan board. Effect of applied' ion (taring Smallpox Epidemic. For this purpose I called upon Mr. W. J. Dibdin, tho Chemist to the London County Council, who has used the chemicals for many years for a similar object, and I find that they are spoken of in the report to the Sanitary Committee of the Metropolitan Board, dated January, 1886, as having been "applied by the Board to the whole of the metropolitan sewage with successful results, when the epidemic of smallpox occurred in the summer of 1885. The death-rate in 1885 from small-pox was 224 per million. The treatment was continued during 1886 and 1887: deaths from smallpox in 1886, 1 per million ; and in 1887, 2 per million. These chemicals were applied on the main sewers in the various districts and at the outfall. I his report to the Board points out the great benefit which would arise from "a complete system of sewage deodorization within the metropolis." Recommendation to generally adopt system of deodorization. It finally recommends "that the system of deodorization during the summer be arranged for the main sewers on the plan adopted by the Board during the past summer and that Local Boards be requested to adopt a similar system with local sewers." 159 mature of manganate op soda by metropolitan board The Board seems to have been using these chemicals for some time previous to this report in 1886 for I find that in 1884, Mr. W. J. Dibdin reports "that the works for the manufacture of manganate of soda were completed at Crossness and a considerable saving in price effected." experts consulted by board. The Board has consulted, as experts on this subject, Messrs. A Dupre F. A. Abel, William Odling, Alex. W. Williamson, and Sir Henry Roscoe, and all the experiments carried out point to satisfactory results having been obtained from the use of the chemicals in question In December, 1887, Sir Henry Roscoe experimented on the deodorization of the London sewage on a large scale with various chemicals, the results being in favour of manganate of soda. report from engineers' department. The reports by the officers of the engineering department of the London County Council also shew that the use of these chemicals has considerably diminished the number of complaints of the street ventilators. present use by council. Notwithstanding all these experiments and results, this recommendation of the Sanitary Committee to the Board, of January, 1886, does not appear to have been fully acted upon, although the manganate of soda and sulphuric acid has been used by the Board and Council at various periods since that date, and is being used at the present time at Hammersmith, to deodorize the sewage passing through the Dawes Road Sewer, and in a number of other places in London. If the Vestry adopt the chemicals proposed to be used by Mr. Reeves, it has before them the example of the Metropolitan Board and Council; it will also be acting in accordance with the advice of Mr. Dibdin, the Chemist to the Council, who has for many years advocated their use. advantage op application op chemicals before decomposition. It is also manifest that the application of these chemicals to the sewage before it has had time to decompose is a better course to adopt than to wait until it has reached the outfall. Mr. Reeves, in one of his books, points out that otherwise "you allow putrefaction to begin at the extreme end the system, and continue the whole length of the sewers (some seventeen consequently when the sewage decomposed thoroughly at its arrival at the outfall the process of treatment is heavier and more costly." 160 RECOMMENDATION. Having read a great quantity of evidence, and numbers of reports, &c., on this subject, I have come to the conclusion that the application of manganate of soda and sulphuric acid to the sewage at different points in the sewers is a very proper course to adopt, and if applied in sufficient quantities would remove the coustant complaints of the sewer ventilators. REDUCTION OF DEATH RATE I believe a thorough application of it would also tend to reduce the sickness and death-rate from zymotic diseases. DETAILS OF SCHEME. Mr. Reeves claims to have arranged an apparatus which applies these chemicals in the best manner to the sewage, and having seen it at work, it certainly appears to me to fulfil the object he aims at. Having heard that the Vestry receives many complaints of offensive smells arising from the ventilators of the North End Road sewer, he has submitted a sketch plan, shewing a number of positions where he suggests that his apparatus should be fixed in the manholes of this sewer. He thinks that 7 of his large apparatus, and 16 of the smaller ones would effectually deodorize the sewer; he also would require some new manholes to be built at different positions, and it would also be necessary to enlarge or build chambers to some of the existing manholes. COST OF PROPOSED WORK. The total cost of the suggested work would be £535, with an estimated annual outlay for chemicals and attendance of £88. Mr, Reeves has proposed to place all his apparatus in manholes in the North End Road sewer, while I think that many of them could be placed with more advantage in the sewers leading into the North End Road. As complaints are often received of the ventilators in the side roads, I should prefer to receive instructions to prepare a scheme for dealing with the whole system of the drainage leading into the North End Road, which I do not think would be more costly than the scheme of Mr. Reeves. SUGGESTED JOINT ADOPTION WITH HAMMERSMITH. This sewer, as I have already pointed out, drains a very large part of Hammersmith, and I recommend that representations should be made to the Hammersmith Vestry, asking them to treat the sewage flowing from their district into ours in a similar manner. INCREASED ADOPTION OF SYSTEM BY LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. The London County Council might also be asked to treat the whole of their sewers in the district in the same manner as they have been dealing with the Dawes Road. 161 hospital, seagrave road As there is a large Fever Hospital in Seagrave Road, the Sewage of which of course passes through this district, I think that representations should be made to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, asking them to thoroughly deodorize all sewage from the Hospital before it reaches our sewers. STABLES IN DISTRICT I also recommend that the owners of large stables where peat moss litter is used be called upon to use these disinfectants. temperature of atmosphere and sewers. The Vestry should know that it is more imperative to use these chemicals at those times when the temperature of the external atmosphere is higher than the temperature in the sewers. This chiefly occurs during the six hottest months of the year, viz., April May, June, July, August, and September. The temperature in the sewers is found to be very equable throughout the year, and may be taken at 52°. conclusion. It must be understood that the recommendations in this report are in addition to those already made in the preceding report on sewers, as the carrying out of this scheme in its entirety would not affect my previous recommendations, which chiefly have reference to the construction of the sewers. I wish to express here my obligation to Mr. W. J. Dibdin, the Chemist, and many other officers of the London County Council, for much of the information I have utilized in this report. I remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES P. NORRINGTON, A.M.I.C.E., Surveyor to the Vestry. Since my appointment, 170 large ventilating manhole covers have been fixed to the existing sewers in the Parish, exclusive of those fixed to new sewers and streets taken over, and 11 shafts have been carried up the sides or fronts of houses in order to otain additional ventilation to the sewers. During the year, 13 new manholes have been built to existing sewers. DRAINAGE. The proper construction of the drainage of houses, has continued to occupy a great deal of the attention of the Vestry during the year and the supervision of the work has been much increased. The water test is applied to each drain and it is not covered in unless perfectly water-tight. 162 On the 29th July, 1891, the Vestry appointed a sub-committee to consider the existing regulations of the Vestry relating to the drainage of houses, and on the 15th February, 1893, the following regulations were adopted.

NORRINGTON, A.M.I.C.E., Surveyor to the Vestry. Note. Ihe Vestry urge on Builders the desirability of providing and fixing ventilators up the fronts of the houses, and connected to the main drains of the houses between the syphon trap and the sewer. Town Hall, Fulham. February 15th, 1893. 167 I again beg to repeat the recommendations I have made in my previous annual reports, viz.:— 1st. That after the drains of all new houses have been tested, a certificate of their efficiency, signed by the Surveyor to the Vestry, should be given to the Owner before any such house is occupied. 2nd. That it should be an offence for an owner to allow a house to be occupied until he can produce such official certificate. 3rd. That additional Inspectors be appointed so as to enable this work to be carried out. Such a certificate would be of great value to the owner of a property, and a charge should be made for it, so as to cover the cost of the extra staff required to carry out the work, and as a consideration for the increased responsibility thrown on the officials. A list of the plans for the drainage of houses submitted to the Vestry, will be found in Schedule III., at the end of the report. The number of new buildings proposed to be erected in the parish, for which plans have been submitted are given in the following Table. NEW BUILDINGS.

Engineers on the 4th March, 1893, and a full description of the construction of the River Wall, &c, read to the members, A considerable amount of satisfaction was expressed with the construction and appearance of the Wall cromwell road bridge The construction of this Bridge is still being delayed owing to the failure of the London County Council to obtain the sanction of Parliament to the principle of betterment The proposals were to levy a special rate to cover one-third of the cost of the Bridge, the Vestry also to pay one-third, and the London County Council the remaining third If the Bridge is not constructed the injury to the North End of the Parish will be very serious I, therefore, again beg to call the attention of the members of the Vestry to the importance of this improvement LAMMAS LANDS The Vestry unfortunately lost the action which was brought against it for trespass on the land known as Lammas Lands in this Parish The action came on for trial on the 22nd of February last before Justice Kekewich, when the Vestry was directed to pay the sum o 40s damages and taxed costs EXCAVATIONS ON THE SITE OF PROPOSED ROADWAYS On the 8th July, 1892, a builder was fined £5 and 2s-costs for excavating and removing sand gravel an subsoil from Dorncliffe Road contrary to the regulations made by the Vestry under Sec 6, 53 & 54 Vic chap 66 of the Metropolis Management

The Vestrn of the Parish of Sutham, FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE New Streets Surveyor. Being for the year 1892-93. W. SYKES, New Streets Surveyor. VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM, In the County of London. New Streets Surveyor's Department, Town Hall, Walham Green, July, 1893. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Fourth Annual Report on matters connected with my department for the year ending 25th March, 1893. During the year 307 summonses have been issued for amounts due for apportionments; the following of which have been contested:— MORNINGTON AVENUE. This summons was issued to recover the estimated expenses of paving opposite a strip of land in Mornington Avenue. The defendant argued that he had a very short interest in the land in question, and merely used it as a passage to the back part of his premises, and that he was not during the continuance of his interest in the property allowed to make any access to the road in question, the Magistrate made an order for the amount claimed, but expressed his opinion that the claim should be allowed by the Vestry as a flank. NORMAND ROAD. It was contended in this case that the Vestry had charged for paving expenses, and proposed to pave on portions of land that had not been dedicated to the Parish. Evidence was given to shew that the public had had a right of user over the land in question for a considerable period. After a lengthy hearing the Magistrate made an order for half the amount claimed; the defendant dedicating the land inquestion to the Parish. ST. ALBANS TERRACE. These summonses were issued against the occupiers to recover the estimated expenses of paving St. Albans Terrace. The Magistrate 214 dismissed the summons on the ground that it had not been proved in evidence that the judgement of a Court of Competent Jurisdiction had been obtained against the owner prior to the proceedings against the occupier. SALISBURY MEWS. The Magistrate after hearing the evidence in this case, held as a fact, that as Salisbury Mews had only one entrance, and was built over on only two sides of the mews, there being no entrance from the mews to the premises on the other side, but simply a blank wall, it was not in fact a new street within the meaning of the Act, and dismissed the summons. EFFIE MEWS. The Magistrate held in this case that Effie Mews was not a new street within the meaning of the Act, there being no evidence of user on the part of the public, and accordingly dismissed the summons. FILMER ROAD. These summonses were issued to recover the estimated cost of paving Filmer Road, which included a portion of the roadway opposite 6 to 10 011 plan. It was argued that the late District Board of Works had already taken to this portion of the road, and that having done so, the Vestry were not entitled to charge for the portion in question. After hearing the evidence the Magistrate made no order. The Vestry appealed on this decision before the Lord Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Cave, when they dismissed the special case, holding that a Vestry having once taken to a new street, or part of a new street, were afterwards bound to maintain the whole of the new street and any addition thereto longitudinally. GREYHOUND ROAD, SEC. V. It was argued in this case that Greyhound Road was not a new street. Evidence was given as to the widening that had taken place, and the erection of new buildings. The Magistrate after having viewed Greyhound Road, decided that it was a new street, and made the orders for the amounts claimed accordingly. I remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. SYKES. 215 additional apportionments.
