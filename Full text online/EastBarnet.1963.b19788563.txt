Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council NINETIETH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1963 by C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S.(Eng.), L.R.C.P.(Lond.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council together with the ANNUAL REPORT of W. K. PICKUP, M.R.S.H. Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council East Barnet Urban District Council NINETIETH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1963 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my report for the year 1963. Vital Statistics for the year show little worthy of comment except that this was a Measles year which has increased the total notifications very considerably. Also there was an outbreak of Sonne Dysentery, almost entirely limited to one school. As usual, this proved a difficult outbreak to limit despite the co-operation of teachers and parents. No apology is needed for once again taking the question of rehousing of priority cases as the main subject for comment. A year or two ago it began to look as if most of the urgent cases had been satisfactorily dealt with, and that it might be possible to anticipate new housing being available for those cases that inevitably crop up. Unfortunately this has not proved to be the case, and I have to record with regret that it has not been found possible to rehouse as yet any of the nine special cases approved for priority on medical grounds during 1963, and that these names have to be added to the four families still waiting from the previous year. A total of thirteen does not perhaps seem to be all that large, but to be seen in proper perspective it has to be appreciated that only a fraction of those investigated by the Public Health Department are finally selected for the priority list, and that the list covers only those where housing conditions are known to be such as must have a steadily deteriorating effect on the health and welfare of the families concerned. It would indeed seem to be that in this area we have some long way to go before the housing problem is solved, and with an ageing population such centres as Vale Court must become increasingly vital. Page Three Food and Drugs control continues to ensure a high degree of purity in products available for sale on and off shop premises in the district and it is noteworthy that no cases of dirty milk bottles were recorded during the year—the first for many years. There can be no doubt that the time and energy put into the inspection of food premises and sampling is very worth while; although like so much Public Health work it cannot by its very nature attract the commendation that it deserves. Finally my sincere thanks to every member of my staff for another year's work. C. M.

Page Nine Page Ten Page Eleven COMMENTS ON STATISTICS Population The Registrar General's mid-year estimate of the population for 1963 is 41,000, which is an increase of 110 over the previous year. This is normal and is the result of natural increase in population. The number of persons per house has increased very slightly from 3.15 to 3.17. Births The number of live births has increased by 20 as compared with 1962, this being an increase of approximately 3.6 per cent on the year. In consequence of this the birth rate has increased by 0.6 per thousand births. The birth rate of 1963 is the highest for a considerable number of years. The figure for 1962 was the highest since 1958. This figure is considerably below that for England and Wales. There were 30 illegitimate births during the year, which is an increase of 10 over the previous year, and there were no illegitimate still births. This figure is considerably over the average for 10 years of illegitimate births which is 20. However, this figure varies very considerably, the highest in the period on which the average was calculated being 35 and the lowest 9. Mortality The death rate is approximately the same as for 1962, being 10.8 as against 10.9 in 1962. This figure is very close to the average for the past 10 years, which is 10.6. The deaths of infants under one year per thousand live births is 21.8. In 1962 it was 27, 1961 it was 22.4, 1960 it was 20.6. The average for the past ten years being 24.4. Owing to the large variation year by year comparison with previous years has little meaning. However, the figure for the past year is lower than the average for 10 years by 2.6. The number of deaths from Cancer during 1963 was the same as that for 1962, being 78, while the average over the past 10 years was 79. The number of deaths from Lung Cancer in 1963 was 21, and the average over the last 8 years was 19.4. There were no deaths from tuberculosis during the year. There was one death from leukaemia in 1963, which is considerably less than in 1962. when there were 4. Over the past 12 years there have been 31 deaths from leukaemia of which 17 were in the last 4 years. Page Twelve In the last 10 years the causes and numbers of deaths have remained fairly static. However, observations which have been drawn in this report are dealing with a very short period and small numbers, consequently it is not fair to attempt to draw conclusions. INTERNATIONAL VACCINATION CERTIFICATES At the end of 1952 a new form was introduced for International Vaccination Certificates requiring authorisation of the signature of the doctor performing the vaccination or inoculation of persons proceeding overseas. During the year several hundred such certificates were authenticated and marked with the authorised stamp. LABORATORY FACILITIES These facilities are provided by the Central Public Health Laboratory Service. The Service has been of the greatest assistance to the Department through its laboratories at Colindale and at Coppetts Wood Hospital. This assistance, and the close co-operation which has continued for so many years between my Department and the Laboratory Service is gratefully acknowledged. The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Laboratory Service for the Department during 1963— Nose and throat swabs 19 Faeces 838 Sputum 5 Other Human 10 Milk 29 Ice Cream 38 Water 2 INFECTIOUS DISEASES Table IV which shows the new cases of Tuberculosis indicates that there were 9 such cases in 1963. The average of new cases over the last 10 years is 20.2. The incidence of Tuberculosis continues to decrease. This decrease can be easily shown when it is noted that the average for the 10 years immediately prior to 1963 was 33.2. Table I, which gives the number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified in 1963, shows a total of 948 such cases. The diseases which make up the greater number of cases notified are the ailments of childhood and vary greatly year by year. Page Thirteen DYSENTERY During the year there were 105 cases of dysentery practically all occurring at one school. This is a comparatively mild disease, although when a large number of cases occur at one school parents become concerned. In this particular instance arrangements were made for a member of the County Medical Officer's staff to address the parents. SPECIAL HOUSING CASES During 1963, 43 families were referred to the department for special consideration for Council housing accommodation on medical grounds. All the families were visited, and after consideration of the reports received from the Inspector visiting the homes and the medical certificates or letter submitted with applications, 9 of the families were recommended to the Housing Committee as being in need of more suitable accommodation. By the end of the year it had not been possible to rehouse any of these families, although 12 families previously approved were given housing. In the case of an elderly couple, however, accommodation was subsequently offered in property managed by the Lancelot Hasluck Trust. There has once again been a demand for accommodation in Vale Court, Bulwer Road, New Barnet. This particular scheme, which provides homes for 18 elderly women, has proved very successful, and there would appear to be a very urgent need for more accommodation of this type. Once again I would like to record my appreciation of the help given by the Housing Manager and his deputy in dealing with recommended cases. Page Fourteen East Barnet Urban District Council REPORT of the CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1963 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present my twelfth annual report to the Council. The year of 1963 was, as far as the Public Health Department was concerned, very similar to previous years. The total of work dealt with by the department increased slightly mainly due to clean air. The appointment of an additional clerk at the end of 1962 has enabled the clerical work of the department to be kept up to date. As may be seen from Table I there has been a reduction in the number of visits made by the Public Health Inspectors. This was due to the resignation of Mr. J. McCormack in June (and the unfortunate illness of my deputy, Mr. S. Smith, which necessitated his absence from work for approximately two months.) A new Inspector, Mr. W. Shackcloth, has been appointed, but does not take up his duties until January. The various other tables in the report reflect the pattern of the work of the department in more detail. The work carried out under the Housing Acts has practically ceased as the Council's programme has been completed. This was reported in the Annual Report for 1962. Undoubtedly, a small number of houses which should be dealt with under the sections dealing with Demolition Orders and Closing Orders still exists; these houses will be found in due course by routine work. I have added a new heading to the Report, Noise Abatement. The Noise Abatement Act was passed in 1960, and I feel that the number of complaints under the Act will gradually increase as its powers Page Fifteen become widely known. It is. however, a very difficult Act to operate, as it is necessary to prove that a particular noise is a statutory nuisance before any action can be taken. This is, of course, a matter of opinion which will vary very considerably between individuals. The use of a noise level meter to assess the volume of the noise is of some help, but no guidance has been given as yet as to the volume of noise which may constitute a nuisance. In conclusion I would express my thanks to every member of the Public Health Department for their support and work during the year. In particular I must thank Mr. Smith, my deputy, for his efforts and assistance during the year. I also wish to thank all other officers of the Council for their assistance and co-operation. W. K.

The figures are set out under various sub-headings and the figures for 1962 are given for a purpose of comparison. The total number of visits shows a decrease over the previous year by 2,138. This decrease is caused by the fact that the department was under staffed by one public health inspector for approximately half a year. The figures do not show any variation which cannot be accounted for by the above remark, and that due to a normal difference in the amount of work under various headings. Nuisances and Sanitary Defects In this section there has been a decrease of 600 visits. These visits are those made following a complaint by a member of the public and those visits made in following up such complaints to ascertain whether the conditions giving rise to the complaint have been remedied. These visits are closely related to the number of complaints received Every complaint received, including anonymous complaints, means at least one visit. In the case of many of the complaints received the Inspector can only give advice, but where contraventions of the Public Health Act, 1936, or other Acts are concerned the necessary notices for the remedying of the complaint are served on the owner or occupier as the case may be. The number of preliminary notices served during the year shows an increase of one. Table II of the report gives the number of notices served both in 1962 and 1963 and the results of the service of those notices. The relationship between the number of notices and complaints seems to vary widely year by year and is mainly due to the cause of the complaint. Table III which lists the repairs earned out as a result of notices served on owners has remained approximately the same as the previous year. verminous premises No visits were made during the year regarding verminous premises. schools. brooks and streams, hairdressers and barbers' premises These are routine inspections and do not vary by any extent year by year. Page Twenty-one FOULING OF FOOTWAYS BY DOGS A number of complaints have been received during the year concerning the fouling of footways by dogs. In all cases the complaints were investigated, but usually the complainants are not prepared to give evidence against neighbours or other nearby residents. Posters drawing attention to the provisions of the by-law concerning this matter were exhibited in the areas from which the complaints were received. National Assistance Act, 1948 — Section 50 burial of the dead Under the above Act the Council may make arrangements for the funeral of persons dying where no provisions have or can be made privately. No cases were dealt with under this section during 1963. SHOPS ACT Routine inspections of shops under this Act have continued and no serious contraventions have been observed during the year. Some of these inspections have to be made outside office hours and on Sundays in order to ascertain that the closing hours and the provisions regarding Sunday trading are being observed. FACTORIES Routine visits to factories and outworkers for the purpose of the Factories Act were made during the year and a total of 172 inspections were made. Two contraventions of the Act were found during the year. Notices were served on the occupiers, which resulted in the necessary works being carried out to make the premises comply with the Act. INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND FOOD POISONING The number of visits made under this heading during the year is 395. This figure shows an increase of 150 on the previous year due to an outbreak of Sonne Dysentery. Page Twenty-two FOOD HYGIENE During the year 1,846 visits were made to various premises in the district where food is handled. Some types of premises require more frequent visits than others by reason of the type of business carried on, and this fact is reflected in the figures for restaurants, snack bars, and butchers' shops. The improvement in food hygiene noted in my last two reports has continued during the year, though it has been necessary to give the occasional warning concerning such unhygienic practices as licking the fingers before picking up wrapping paper and the blowing of bags to open them. A number of shops have continued to display notices requesting customers to refrain from smoking whilst in the shop, and I would like to see this practice become universal in food shops. Shopkeepers continue to ask for notices, supplied free of charge by the department, requesting the public not to take dogs into food shops. It was noticeable that when these were first made available shopkeepers were hesitant to display them fearing, it is presumed, that they might give offence to dog-loving customers, but during the past two or three years it has become obvious that the large majority of owners of food shops are only too ready to display them. MILK SUPPLY One application was received for a Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licence under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. Under these Regulations licences issued now remain in force for a period of five years instead of annually as heretofore and supplementary licences are no longer necessary. FOOD AND DRUGS The following table shows the various types of food and drugs sampled during the year: No. of samples Butter 1 Cheese Flaps 1 Chicken Fillets 1 Coffee 1 Condensed Milk 1 Chow Mein 1 Page Twenty-three Dairy Cream 3 Evaporated Milk 2 Fish Paste 1 Ground Almonds Herb Tea 1 Instant Mashed Potato 1 Lard 1 Lemon Curd 1 Marzipan 1 Milk 14 Milk, Channel Islands and South Devon 12 Mince 1 Mixed Fruit 1 Mixed Herbs 2 Orange Squash 1 Pork Luncheon Meat 2 Sal-Volatile 3 Sausages, cooked 1 Sausages, Pork 2 58 Of the above mentioned samples two were reported as being unsatisfactory viz: one sample of Pork Sausages, and one sample of Spirit of Sal-Volatile. pork sausages A sample of pork sausages was found to contain preservative within the permitted limit but no declaration was made at the time of sale of its presence. This provision of the Preservatives in Food Regulations 1962 is normally complied with by the exhibiting of a easily readable notice in a conspicuous place in the shop but unfortunately such notices are often mislaid by shopkeepers. A warning letter was sent in this instance. spirit of sal-volatile In this particular sample the full ammonia was considerably below the minimum figure required by the British Pharmaceutical Codex and should have been described as "Spirit of Sal-Volatile B.P.C," and not " B.P." Page Twenty-four It was a prepacked sample and enquiries of the manufacturing chemists revealed that this particular sample of spirit had been bottled some ten years ago. Enquiries then made of the chemist selling the sample showed that it was part of some stock he had bought from a business that had closed down. A letter was sent pointing out the importance of carefully examining all goods containing volatiles and the remainder of the stock was voluntarily destroyed. A sample of sausages cooked in batter was submitted for analysis following a complaint that the batter had turned pink. The sample consisted of a sausage " toad in the hole " cooked in a large metal baking dish. Examination showed that the sausages were of a bright pink colour and areas of the batter where the sausages had been in contact also showed traces of pink colouration. The analysis showed that the colouration was due to the presence of artificial colouring matter in the sausages and the colouring matter was identified as one of those which is permitted to be used in food stuffs by the Colouring Matter in Food Regulations, 1957. On cooking, some of the colour had migrated from the sausages to the adjacent batter, giving it an unusual pink hue. milk bottles For the first time I am able to report that no complaints were received during the year concerning dirty milk bottles. ice cream One application was received for the registration of premises for the sale of ice cream. The premises and equipment being satisfactory the application was granted. Thirty-eight samples of ice cream were obtained and submitted for bacteriological examination. All the samples were reported Provisional Grade 1. This is the fifth successive year that I have been able to report all the samples of ice cream taken during the year as being Grade 1. There are no premises manufacturing ice cream for sale in the district. All ice cream is obtained from large wholesale firms. HOUSING There were at the beginning of 1963 three confirmed clearance areas affecting eight houses which had not been demolished and clearance area, East Barnet Road No. 3, containing three houses which had not Page Twenty-five been confirmed at the end of 1962. The area, East Barnet Road No. 3, was confirmed by the Ministry during 1963. None of these areas had been demolished by the end of the year. During the period under review the Medical Officer of Health did not represent to the Council any new clearance areas Demolition Orders and Closing Orders At the beginning of 1963 there were six houses on which demolition orders had been made but the houses not demolished and sixteen houses on which closing orders were in force. The houses on which demolition orders were outstanding were as follows: 20, 22, 43 Lancaster Road, New Barnet. 1 Hexham Road, New Barnet. 23 Victoria Road, New Barnet. 9 Edward Grove, New Barnet. The premises on which closing orders were operative being: 51a, 90, 96, 101 East Barnet Road, New Barnet. 55 Lyonsdown Road, New Barnet. 7 Victoria Road, New Barnet. 123, 125, 127 Brunswick Park Road, New Southgate, N.ll. 12, 16, 18 Victoria Avenue, New Barnet. 3 Dury Road, Hadley, Barnet. 57 Somerset Road, New Barnet. 120, 131 Lancaster Road, New Barnet. There was also at this time one premises being 46a East Barnet Road, New Barnet, on which the owner had given an undertaking to carry out the necessary repairs. During 1963, 43 Lancaster Road, 23 Victoria Road, 123, 125, 127 Brunswick Park Road and 55 Lyonsdown Road were demolished. The work of reconstruction under section 24 of the Housing Act, 1957. which was in progress on 1 Hexham Road and 9 Edward Grove was completed and the demolition orders on the premises were revoked. The closing orders on 3 Dury Road and 57 Somerset Road were determined. The other orders and the undertaking being still operative. There were no demolition orders or closing orders made during the year. The houses Nos. 11 and 13 Lancaster Road which were in a clearance area which was not confirmed by the Minister were being repaired at the end of the year. The owner of these premises had practically to reconstruct parts of the premises in order to make them comply with the Housing Acts. Page Twenty-six As may be seen by Table III a considerable amount of work of repair was carried out by owners after the service of statutory and intimation notices. Three notices under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1957, were served in 1962. The owners of the premises concerned did not comply with the notices and in consequence the Council had to carry out the work in default. The work required by one of these notices was completed in December whilst the work required by the other two was in progress at the end of the year. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT, 1960 With the coming into operation of this Act "noise or vibration which is a nuisance " is added to the list of Statutory Nuisances for which action can be taken under Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. It should, however, be noted that in the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business it is a defence to prove that the best practicable means of preventing or counteracting the noise or vibration have been adopted. Not only may the Council take action but any three occupiers of premises who are affected by a noise may make complaint, as to a noise nuisance, to a justice of the peace, for action directly by the Court. During the year complaints were received in respect of two premises. In the first instance readings were taken on a portable sound level meter and compared with readings obtained in various parts of the district. The noise in this particular case emanated from a factory smelting metal and making die castings and appeared to increase so far as the complainants were concerned following the demolition of a terrace of cottage property following action taken by the Council under the Housing Act. That part of the factory housing the furnaces was rebuilt during the year and a wooden fence erected along the boundary. Subsequent readings taken on the sound level meter at the same points as when the complaints were first received showed a general drop of approximately four decibels. The Noise Abatement Act defines no standard as to the noise level which may be considered as a nuisance but the British Building Research Station have issued a simplified method of assessing noise level readings in order to give some indication as to the level which would cause serious complaints. This method, being the only one available, was used for assessing whether or not the noise levels in the roads adjoining the factory were sufficiently high to be considered a nuisance. After consideration of all the factors involved it was considered that the level of noise in this particular instance was not sufficient Page Twenty-seven to be classified as a nuisance. The management of the factory were very concerned that complaints should have been received and have indicated their willingness to take all reasonable and practical measures to reduce the noise. A change from the present oil fired furnaces to the use of gas as a fuel for smelting would probably solve the problem of noise and it is to be hoped that it will be possible to make this change in the not too distant future. In the case of the second complaint residents in flats over a roundthe-clock self-service launderette complained of noise and fumes from the washing and drying machines. After taking readings with a sound level meter the owner of the launderette was met on the site and showed considerable co-operation in assisting to reduce the noise. This matter is still being dealt with consequently a final report cannot be made. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 During the year 1963 the Council continued with its programme under the Act. At the end of 1962 there were three smoke control areas operative which made 2,891 domestic dwellings subject to Smoke Control Orders and a fourth area was awaiting the approval of the Ministry. This order was approved without modification and immediately the approval was received the necessary forms and explanatory memoranda were sent to all owners and occupiers in the area covered by the Order. The Order became operative on 1st October, 1963, and the number of applications received for approval of works under the Act was about 60% of the number of houses estimated to require works of adaptation. This, however, has been a feature of the areas which are now operative, and very few contraventions of the Orders have been noted. The usual procedure when a contravention is found is to visit the premises and to write the offender a letter pointing out the offence. This has usually had the desired effect and up to the present no case has arisen in which it has been ncessary to take legal action. Since the Act came into force and the Council decided to institute a programme which will make the whole of the Urban District smokeless in a period of twelve years the general attitude of the public has been one of co-operation. This co-operation has undoubtedly made the work of the Department much easier and if it had not been forthcoming would have resulted in a complete breakdown of the programme for the District. At the end of 1963 the area of the District which is the subject of Smoke Control Orders is the area bounded by Longmore Avenue from the railway bridge, East Barnet Road to Cat Hill, Cat Hill to Park Road, then northwards along Park Road and northeasterly along Page Twenty-eight Edgworth Road to the roundabout and north to the Urban District boundary. The southern boundary being the north side of Chase Way, crossing Hampden Way and the north side of the passageway between No. 70 and No. 72 Hampden Way and then in a S.W. direction to Pymmes Brook and then northward along Pymmes Brook, west along Parkside Gardens, Avondale Avenue to the Urban District boundary, On the west by the Urban District Boundary as far as the railway bridge over Longmore Avenue. The area at present subject to Smoke Control Orders comprises 4,256 houses. The Council at its December meeting approved Smoke Control Order No. 5 and the Order was sent to the Minister for confirmation. This area is bounded on the north by the northside of Parkside Gardens, the north side of Avondale Avenue from Church Hill Road to the passageway to Gallants Farm Road, and the north side of the passageway including the footbridge over the railway line to the Urban District boundary; on the east by Pymmes Brook ; on the south by the northern boundary of the Great Northern London Cemetery to Brunswick Park Road; north along the west side of Brunswick Park Road to the northern boundary of Standard Telephones & Cables Ltd., west, north and then west along the said boundary to the railway embankment, west along the north side of the railway embankment to the Urban District boundary ; on the west by the Urban District boundary. The area contains 1,313 private dwellings and it is estimated that 1,582 fireplaces require conversion or adaptation to satisfactorily burn smokeless fuel. The total capital cost of this work will be approximately £19,430 of which the net estimated capital cost to the Council will be £5,829 after Exchequer grants have been received. This cost would, of course, only be realised if all the owners applied for grant and from previous experience this seems unlikely. This area does not contain quite so many houses as the previous one No. 4 but the cost is the highest of all the areas yet approved as there are a greater number of fireplaces to be converted. In December, 1963, the Ministry issued Circular No. 69/63 this circular advises with regard to revised arrangements for the availability of smokeless fuels and grants. In principle the circular states that there will be little further increase in the production of gas coke and as this coke has been the mainstay of open coke burning fires in smoke control areas it is not safe to rely on such supplies. In view of the above the circular states that the Minister considers that the installation of openable stoves, under-floor draught open fires or fixed gas, electric storage or oil heaters should now be regarded as "reasonably necessary " works and that the full expenditure on such installations should rank for grant. Also that encouragement be given to householders to choose a form of space heating other than improved open grates. Page Twenty-nine The general effect of this circular will be that the cost of Smoke Control Order No. 5 and future Orders will be considerably increased over the estimated figures on the present basis. However, it does give a householder a wider choice of more efficient appliances and with a reasonable grant towards the cost. In due course an estimate of the increased total costs together with a new schedule of approved costs of works ranking for grant will be submitted to the Council for their approval. In October a Public Meeting was held in Southaw Girls' School with a programme similar to meetings held in previous years. The Chairman of the General Purposes Committee opened the proceedings and a panel consisting of the Chairman, members of the Coal, Electricity and Gas Boards, the Medical Officer of Health and myself were present to answer questions from the audience. Unfortunately the attendance was very poor and the panel and other members of the Boards outnumbered the audience. All three Boards had arranged exhibitions of appliances in the hall. The Council has continued to participate in the scheme for the measurement of air pollution and the necessary equipment has been in operation since early in 1962. The information derived from this equipment is forwarded to a central laboratory and forms part of the scheme for the estimation of air pollution in the Greater London area. In connection with this scheme a summary of monthly readings for the year of 1963 is appended. SMOKE (microgrammes per cubic metee) Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov.

December, 1962, however, was a smog period and the concentrations would, of course, be exceptionally high. It is quite apparant that the fluctuations are closely linked to weather. Page Thirty A report on atmospheric pollution issued by the Warren Springs laboratory states that the major factor in determining the pattern of a concentration of sulphur dioxide and smoke is the weather which determines the tendency of pollutants to build up near ground level or to be dispersed harmlessly into the upper atmosphere. From the report also it is obvious that smoke concentrations have fallen dramatically in London since 1955-56 but there has been no detectable reduction in sulphlir dioxide concentrations. The average sulphur dioxide concentration in 1962-63 was 332 microgrammes per cubic metecand the smoke concentration was 110 microgrammes per cubic metee. It will be seen that both the smoke and sulpha dioxide concentrations in East Barnet are very considerably below these figures. The amount of work due to the operation of the Clean Air Act continues to increase as the number of areas becomes larger. Although on paper an area becomes operative on the 1st October each year there still remains a number of householders who appear to leave works until the last moment and also a number of enquiries are received each year regarding earlier areas. WATER SUPPLY The Lee Valley Water Company supplies the district with its water supply. The supply is largely obtained from deep wells sunk into chalk. The Company took 2,349 samples of water representative of supply for bacteriological examination over the whole of its area of supply. Of these only 9 contained E Coli, giving a percentage of purity of 99.6 per cent. During the year the Water Company took 398 samples of water for bacteriological and 20 samples for chemical examination from the local supply. All these samples were satisfactory. In addition to the above 10 water samples for bacteriological examination were submitted by the Department to the Laboratory at Coppetts Wood Hospital. All these samples were satisfactory. INFESTATIONS rodent control During the year 498 complaints of rats and mice were investigated and where necessary the premises adjoining the houses from which the original complaints were received were also visited. In consequence 653 properties were inspected for the presence of rats and mice. Of these properties 464 were found to have signs of infestations and were treated. Page Thirty-one The number of complaints received during 1963 shows a considerable increase over the previous year. The infestations were all of a minor character though one or two were difficult to eradicate. Warfarin has been used in the majority of cases though where difficulty has been experienced further treatments using a different poison have usually produced results. A 10 per cent Test Baiting followed by a treatment of those manholes which showed a "take" was carried out during July. 224 manholes were test baited and of these 15 manholes showed takes. In the subsequent treatment 57 manholes were treated with warfarin. These manholes being those which showed "takes" and those in the immediate vicinity. After the first baiting 13 still showed takes which were rebaited. After the second baiting no more takes were recorded. insect control The majority of complaints regarding infestation of premises by insects were those of carpet beetles, moths and wasps. All complaints were investigated and advice given and where necessary insecticides supplied free of cost. During the year 79 wasp nests were destroyed. This figure is much higher than in 1962 when only 13 wasp nests were dealt with. The figure is a reasonable figure and probably represents the majority of the wasp nests which were causing a nuisance to ratepayers. The Council charge of 25/- per nest was, of course, maintained. This figure of 25/- is the approximate cost to the Council of the work involved and is considerably lower than that made by outside firms specialising in insect eradication. OTHER INSPECTIONS pet shops Three persons are licensed to keep pet shops in the district and visits are made periodically to the premises. In each case the business has been found to be carried on satisfactorily. Page Thirty-two
