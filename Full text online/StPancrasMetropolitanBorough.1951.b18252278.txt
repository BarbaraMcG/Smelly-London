June, 1952. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting to you my Annual Report for 1951 upon the conditions of health and sanitation in the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. In previous reports I have referred to the large amount of money that is being spent on curative medicine as compared with the small sums available for the prevention of disease. The hospital service today costs well over 250 million pounds and it is now the usual practice at health conventions to refer to this huge sum and to argue that more should be spent in preventing those conditions which necessitate the admission of patients to hospital. This is undoubtedly true and accepted, but one point, however, appears to be forgotten. By the time a patient has been admitted to a hospital he has often been ill for some while and has sought the advice of his own general practitioner who finally has advised that he should enter hospital. Preventive medicine should commence, therefore, not at the time when an illness is so bad that hospital treatment is required, but at the time when a patient first goes to his general practitioner. We hear much today, not only about the long waiting lists for admission to hospital, but even more of the fact that the general practitioner is over-worked and is seeing more patients than he should. Schemes are now being considered whereby doctors shall be so remunerated that they will in fact be encouraged to have fewer patients in order that they may devote more time to each. We hear, moreover, that the bulwark in preventive medicine is the general practitioner who sees the family as a whole and knows the conditions under which the family has to fight disease. It is my opinion that we should do more than realise this fact: we should do something to help the general practitioner, not only to enable him to devote more time to his patients but to give him help in preventing that set of circumstances that are leading to illness amongst those for whom he has undertaken responsibility. No Medical Officer of Health could have better co-operation from the general practitioners of his district than I have in St. Pancras, and I would like to pay a tribute to the help I so regularly receive. I hope: during the year to approach at least some of the doctors in St. Pancras with a view to seeing if we cannot combine to investigate some of those conditions which they themselves see as prejudicial to health, and to bring before you a scheme to effect this. Sanitary Inspection. The main work of a public health department is directed towards securing that the inhabitants of the district live in healthy, happy and comfortable surroundings. To the counter of the department arrive, therefore, residents and workers in the borough who need help and guidance. The fact that about 6,000 official complaints as well as a similar number of enquiries were made during the year is some indication of the value which the public sets on this section of your activities. Many complaints are received relating to premises, sanitary defects, food, noise and disturbance of health and comfort, but an equal number of persons come to the department counter to seek help rather than to complain. This help might be 5 in connection with the care or removal of a friend or relative to a hospital or institution, as to the care of children, or in some personal problem concerning which the caller is worried. It is the aim of the department that in no case is the enquiry unanswered. Many of the complaints relate to housing, the applicant relating the number of years he has waited, the time he has been resident in the borough, the size of his family, the inadequacy of his accommodation and various medical and social reasons why he should receive priority. Insofar as possible an attempt is made to ameliorate the conditions under which the applicant is living pending re-housing. This can often be done by the remedying of sanitary defects and the solving of family and social problems. The magnitude of the work of the department is indicated by the fact that no less than 57,642 visits were made by your public health staff during 1951. I feel sure the Council will regret the slight increase in the number of statutory notices it was necessary to serve. It will regret still more the fact that a summons had to be taken out in 201 cases, and I would assure the members of the Council that before legal proceedings are commenced every step has been taken beforehand to secure a peaceful settlement. In every case an intimation notice and a statutory notice must be served, but in addition a warning letter is always sent asking the person responsible to remedy the defect and thus avoid the necessity of seeking the help of the Court. House to house inspections were commenced towards the end of 1950. Each of your district sanitary inspectors carries out a certain number each month, and during the year the total was 325. This figure is not high, but it indicates a trend in the right direction, namely, to prevent property becoming the subject of a complaint rather than to wait until occupants seek the help of the department. The houses in question are mostly tenement houses and these routine inspections secure that the tenants live in clean rooms and are provided with reasonable amenities such as accommodation for cooking and a water supply on one of the floors occupied by each family in the house. Infectious Diseases. The number of cases of measles notified during the year was 1,993 compared with 1,057 in 1950. Dysentery also shows an increase, there being notified 106 cases compared with 44. This type of dysentery is usually of a mild nature. It is, however, highly infectious and tends to affect children of nursery and school age. When it occurs in a nursery it may easily affect the majority of children and virtually bring its activities to a temporary end. Knowledge as to the method of the spread of infection is not very certain, and although every precaution is, taken to prevent its entry into a nursery and to control it once it is there by means of exclusion isolation, disinfection and general methods of hygiene, the disease usually terminates when most of the children who are susceptible to infection have contracted it. There has been no mortality resulting from dysentery. It is probable that there are many cases of infection due to this type of the dysentery germ, known as the sonne bacillus which are so mild that medical advice is not always sought and the disease is not notified. Apart from these two diseases St. Pancras was reasonably free from infection. Only five cases of acute poliomyelitis occurred as compared with 26 in the previous year, and of these only three showed paralytic symptoms. Tuberculosis. Once again I would like to draw the attention of the Council to the problem of tuberculosis. Within this volume will be found a table setting out the notifications of tuberculosis that have been received during the year, and investigations we have made in connection with them. 6 At the time of writing this report the tuberculosis regulations of 1930 have been repealed, and in their place we have new regulations which in summary cause tuberculosis to be notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the borough council and by him to the County of London. The injunction to keep a register no longer applies, though in a circular issued on 18th April, 1952, Medical Officers of Health are advised of the advantage of continuing to do so. The following table sets out the position in St. Pancras in 1950, with the comparison of some of the other boroughs in London: Tuberculosis—1950. Borough. Population (estimated). On Register. New cases, including transfers in, etc. Deaths. No. Rate per 1,000. No. Rate per 1,000. No. Rate per 1,000. St. Pancras 141,300 1,436 10.16 398 2.66 76 0.53 Bermondsey 59,810 696 11.64 141 2.36 28 0.47 Hackney 172,100 2,072 12.04 341 1.98 63 0.37 Paddington 130,600 1,213 9.29 302 2.31 55 0.42 St. Marylebone 78,260 933 11.92 157 2.01 21 0.27 The number of persons on the register at the beginning of the year was 1,436. This had increased by 171 to 1,607 by December 31st. Insofar as it was possible a visit was paid in every case where we became aware of a case of tuberculosis in the borough. In all, 274 addresses were visited. The results of these investigations are well worth examination. Statutory overcrowding existed in 23 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and in three cases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis. 166 persons suffering from tuberculosis did not sleep in a separate bedroom, and in 22 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis where the patient was infectious, as indicated by the finding of the tuberculosis bacillus in the sputum, the patient actually slept in the same room as children. In 9 of these cases the families were overcrowded within the meaning of the Housing Act, 1936, and in the remaining cases if the patient slept in a separate room it would often have meant the use of the living room as a bedroom. I have tried to divide the new infections into various categories associated with the type of employment of the sufferer. Category 1 includes professional people, category 3 the artisan and category 5 the unskilled worker. Category 2 comes in between 1 and 3 and category 4 between 3 and 5. Of the 274 cases investigated six were in category 1, 22 in category 2, 86 in category 3, 104 in category 4 and 56 in category 5. These figures tend to indicate to some extent that the better the conditions of education and living the less is the risk of tuberculosis. As against this it must be remembered that the majority of the persons living in the borough would normally fall into categories 3, 4 and 5. In 39 of the above cases accommodation included basement rooms and only 93 of the families lived in self-contained dwellings. 108 patients had a separate bedroom, 166 a separate bed. I would refer in particular to the fact that in 76 of the 274 homes visited it was necessary to serve notices for a sanitary defect. This alone justifies the work involved by your sanitary inspectors in visiting homes where tuberculosis has been notified. At least in 27.-7 per cent. of the homes was it possible to provide some improvement as a result of the visit. 7 On the brighter side, eight families investigated during the year obtained alternative housing accommodation, apart from those visited in previous years. Adequate housing accommodation and proper environmental conditions for every case of tuberculosis continue to be ideals which have small chance of attainment in the near future. In the meanwhile the public health department has done much to improve the living conditions of the patients by enforcing compliance with public health notices relating to dampness, leaking roofs, general repair and redecoration and the provision of adequate water supplies. In addition, your inspectors are giving much tactful advice on such matters as sleeping arrangements to reinforce the advice of the chest clinic to secure that the patient should have a separate room or at least a separate bed, or by emphasising the need for adequate ventilation and'how it can be secured. In addition, much helpful guidance is given where requested in welfare matters such as where and how to obtain financial assistance. Co-operation with the Chest Physician and his staff is close and continuous and we are much indebted to Dr. Back for his active co-operation. I feel sure you will wish me to refer in particular to the splendid work which is being carried out by your sanitary inspectors in helping, insofar as we may, in the difficult problem of tuberculosis. It remains serious, although there are signs that newer drugs and newer methods of treatment are becoming available to the patient. Many lives are being saved and many conditions considered hopeless some years ago are responding to treatment. It may be argued that this means that there is a larger background of tuberculosis in the borough in that the chances of survival of the tubercular are being increased. I do not think this is actually so. The infectious patient was largely the chronic case of tuberculosis treated at home. It is possible that modern methods of investigation and treatment secure that tuberculosis is treated earlier and the patient rendered free from infection at a considerably earlier date than heretofore. However this may be, tuberculosis still remains the major endemic disease with which we have to cope, and although the tuberculosis regulations have been modified I am satisfied that many Government departments and every type of council has an important part to play in its eradication. As the sanitary authority is the authority responsible for environmental hygiene it is almost impossible to exaggerate the importance of the metropolitan borough in this field. Food and Drugs. Your Public Health Department continued its close supervision of the food sold and consumed in the Borough. It is pleasing to know that of the 330 samples of milk which were analysed chemically not one was found to be adulterated. Whereas the law lays down that ice cream shall contain not less than 5 per cent. of fat it will be found that of the 62 samples examined none was found to be deficient and the fat content was well over the minimum standard, being as much as over 14 per cent. in one case and exceeding 6 per cent. in all but 9 samples. Of the 178 samples of ice cream examined for bacteriological purity 133 were of grades I and II, that is the two highest of the four grades into which ice cream is divided for this test. In those cases where the grade was III or IV an immediate investigation was made, from which it was usually found that a small technical fault caused temporary bacteriological increase. Further samples showed an improvement in standard. There is a very close collaboration between your Food Inspectors and manufacturers of ice cream which has resulted in a steady improvement in the quality of this product. These remarks do not mean that vigorous action is not taken where this is warranted. Legal proceedings were instituted in seven cases, where either a particular food was found to be adulterated or unfit for human consumption. 8 Care of the Aged. In my annual report for last year I referred to the work which is being done in the borough by the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged, setting out its constitution and the fact that it represented close co-operation between voluntary and municipal effort. So intimately is the work associated with the health of the borough that I feel sure a report on the activities of S.P.A.C.A. will be welcomed in this report, both by councillors and members of the various voluntary associations concerned. The work of the association commenced in April, 1950, and 1951 represented its first full year's work. In fact even during 1951 the plan of the scheme was receiving consideration and the Committee was seeking to find out and anxious to learn which of its activities were most needed and which would be most welcomed. As your Medical Officer of Health I am mainly interested in the prevention of the disabilities of old age rather than in curative measures or rehabilitation to mitigate bad circumstances which have been allowed to arise. The Committee agreed in the first place that an ideal scheme would be one whereby retired persons might be kept under observation and advice tendered to them before their condition became such that cure and rehabilitation was required. Accordingly at the Association's request the Council appointed a Health Officer who was a trained nurse, and to her was allocated a district in which there were known to be living approximately 300-400 persons of retirement age. All of these persons were visited and in fact have been visited more or less regularly throughout the year. Many of them were hale and hearty, working, independent, and in no need of assistance. Others required a certain amount of help and further interests in life through the Darby and Joan Clubs and various activities to which I will refer later. The needs of these people were met. Other cases were in need of actual assistance. Some were no longer able to live at home. These were few in number and arrangements had to be made to provide for them either in hospital or institution. Quite a large number, however, needed considerable assistance in order to enable them to live at home in happiness and comfort. Experience showed that one Health Officer could advise and help more than 300-400 persons of retirement age in view of the fact that only a small proportion required active help and frequent visiting. Accordingly towards the end of the year Miss Mackie, your Health Officer, was given another area. To-day she is visiting regularly and keeping in touch with some 700 old people. This work is true preventive work and I am satisfied that this appointment has more than justified itself, not only in the happiness and comfort it brings to old people, but probably economically as well, for it is possible that a large number of old persons are being cared for in their own homes who otherwise might be in State institutions at a very large cost to the Country. Miss Mackie paid no less than 1,461 visits during that part of the year during which she gave her full time to the work. So satisfied has the Association been with the appointment of a Health Officer for old people that the Council has been asked to make another appointment of a similar nature, and to this request the Council has acceded. The following table shows the ages of the people who received visits during the year and gives some indication of the help which was made available. Ages 60/70 70/80 80/90 Over 90 Visits 203 473 217 12 9 Action recommended and/or taken : Institution or hospital 18 Visit by Medical Officer of Health or private practitioner 11 Wireless set 11 Bedding or furniture 13 Clothing 13 Meal vouchers or dinners 30 Voluntary visitor 16 Home Help 13 Holidays 25 Other assistance 21 The work of the Council's Health Officer, however, is not the complete story of visits to old people. No less than 70-80 voluntary visitors have been visiting one or two old people regularly throughout the year. I have no hesitation in saying that old people look forward to these visits and receive help and comfort from them. The reports I receive month by month indicate the varied advice and help which the old people in the borough need. In addition to this the British Red Cross Society arranges visits to some 26 old people through its members. I received a monthly report concerning each old person visited with an indication of the state of health and the need for any particular assistance. During 1951 no less than 136 old people were sent away for a holiday to Margate, Ramsgate or Herne Bay. The holiday lasted a fortnight and the parties were taken down from the Town Hall to the holiday home by coach. These holidays took place during the months of April, May, September and October. The total cost was £743 17s. 6d. of which £273 11s. 8d. was recovered in contributions from the old people. It will be seen therefore that the average cost to an individual retired person was £2 0s. 3d. Many of the people we sent away were enjoying the first holiday they had had for many years. The arrangement for their care was excellent and many letters of appreciation were received. Another venture that has achieved much success has been a chiropody clinic. From the moment this clinic commenced we have had a waiting list. Originally it appeared that we could see some 8 to 10 people a week and we had hoped that in this way we could cope with some 400 to 500 persons a year. Experience showed us, however, that the cases referred to us needed not just one visit to the chiropodist but regular visits at intervals of four weeks to two months in order to secure continuance of comfort. In fact with one session a week we find we can care for approximately 120 to 140 individuals. No matter what the weather, appointments were kept, and those persons who were unable to come on account of sickness or some other reason, invariably wrote regretting their inability to attend and asking for another appointment. The Committee has decided to hold two clinics a week and I have no doubt but that the demand will still exceed our capacity to meet it. The Committee may remember that last year I referred to the fact that some old people were found to be suffering from malnutrition and possibly anaemia induced thereby. We advised that in our opinion many of those living alone failed to provide themselves with adequate meals even although they were physically capable of doing so. Lack of facilities or unwillingness to cook a meal for themselves alone was a possible cause and the Committee commenced a scheme for assisting certain retired persons to obtain meals in the L.C.C. restaurants in the district. The demand for this assistance was not very big and was made difficult by the closure of the majority of the L.C.C. restaurants in the borough. Furthermore, the vouchers, which were of the value of 6d. and could be used towards the cost of the main 10 course of a meal, still left the old person rather more to pay than he could afford. We have now brought in additional restaurants in the borough and increased the value of the voucher to 9d. There are signs that this scheme is being more frequently used than heretofore. The provision of meals in the home through the Invalid Kitchens has continued during 1951. 9,335 meals were provided for approximately 73 individuals. The recipients were housebound and other arrangements for the provision of meals were not available. The meal was provided in most cases five days a week. We have continued to supply wireless sets to old people and at the time of writing this report the number of old persons in the borough who are using wireless sets provided by the association is 24. In some cases owing to lack of electricity in the house we have had to supply battery sets. This has not been too satisfactory but we have now made reasonable arrangements for servicing the sets and for the replacement of batteries. The medical clinic for old people has continued and Dr. Tracy has attended regularly every week and has been available for consultation for approximately 10 to 12 people at each session. These clinics have disclosed many of the difficulties of old people. Physical defects are not the only troubles. Loneliness is perhaps the most serious and this is often accompanied by depression. Deafness sometimes accentuates both these conditions. The old people have welcomed the opportunity of discussing their troubles with a doctor. Advice has been asked and usually taken. Many individuals have been referred to their own doctor or to hospital and they have been told and advised how to obtain many of the benefits which are available to them. The scheme upon which S.P.A.C.A. works is, as I have said, a very happy example of municipal and voluntary effort. Admittedly most of the money has been found by the Council contributing, under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, to a voluntary association which includes amongst its functions the provision of meals and recreation to old people, but voluntary subscriptions have also been available. A dance organised during the year raised £148 5s. 6d. and £75 was received from Alexandra Rose Day. Whilst it is the Public Health Department that is most intimately concerned with the work of S.P.A.C.A. it is by no means the only department. The minutes have been kept and the administration organised by the voluntary services of the Town Clerk and members of his department, whilst the Borough Treasurer has acted as Hon. Treasurer to the Association. A very material contribution to the welfare of old people has, moreover, been made by the Housing Department, and the following extract from a report of the Housing Manager gives some indication of that department's care for old people. "The whole of the borough for housing purposes is divided into eight administrative areas, each area being under the control of an Estate Manager who has complete information regarding the old people residing in Borough Council property within his area. The total number of old people in property under the control of the Council is 394, which comprises 66 couples, 216 single women and 46 single men, and my records show that of the 66 couples, 51 live by themselves and 15 live with relatives. Of the 216 single women 165 live alone and 51 live with relatives. Of the 46 single men 38 live alone and 8 with relatives. Full details of old people on the Council's Housing Estates are known either to the Estate Manager, the Resident Caretaker or Responsible Tenant, and their numerous problems are promptly dealt with and generally overcome. Where the old 11 people are living in requisitioned property, however, the problem does become somewhat difficult, but this has been greatly overcome by the Estate Manager having a contact in the house who notifies him, if necessity arises, regarding any matter affecting old people. This has always worked satisfactorily but it was felt that so far as was reasonably possible, and as suitable accommodation became available, accommodation should be let to old people in houses where there were other aged persons resident as they do help each other. The houses so far being used have varied in number but now total 18 in which 7 couples, 34 women, and 8 men reside. Many of these houses have a younger person or couple living there who keep an eye on the old people and help them if necessary. Such services have been freely given. My records also show people with any form of incapacity, the facts of which are fully known to the Estate Manager for the area. It is the intention to use the Euston Road Hostel as accommodation for elderly persons but owing to extremely few vacancies it has only been possible to find accommodation for five elderly ladies and one elderly couple. Future vacancies will be utilised for meeting the needs of old people, especially on the lower floors, the upper floors being used for elderly but agile persons. Two vacancies are pending and have already been earmarked for this purpose. This accommodation is admirably suited for rehousing old people being near to the shops, post office, buses, etc., and has the added advantage of a resident supervisor on the premises. During the past twelve months the following old people have been rehoused from the waiting list in accordance with the ' Points Scheme ' approved by the Council:— Over 70 25 single old people. 4 couples. Aged 60 to 70 30 single old people. 17 couples." It would be difficult for me in this report to point to any organization or individual to whose services particular praise is due, but I think we should all agree that the help of the Mayor and Mayoress of St. Pancras throughout the year has been an inspiration, the value of which it would be hard to exaggerate. The work of S.P.A.C.A. is continuing in 1952 and the Council has already determined to make a grant towards its expenses. Voluntary funds may also be available. Good as the above scheme may be, it is not complete. It is only limited by funds. It is a young association. If it has achieved much it has also learnt how much more is required by one particular section of the community. Housing. I am much indebted to Mr. Davey for many of the figures which I place before you in connection with the situation of housing in the borough. It is against the background of housing need that our work must be carried out. Mr. Davey tells me that on the 31st March there were 10,712 families on our list awaiting rehousing. 298 new flats were occupied during the year, and altogether by means of vacancies and transfers the total rehousing movement affected 736 families. Of the total of 34 bed-sitting room flats occupied during the past twelve months 27 have been let to people over 60 years of age. 12 The following table gives an indication of the Council's housing progress during the past few years: No. of pre-war flats 1,203 No. destroyed by enemy action 52 Post-war flats occupied 31st March, 1952 1,077 No. building 413 Requisitioned premises at 31st March, 1952 870 No. of tenants: On estates 2,249 In Requisitioned houses 1,689 In Temporary houses 214 In other houses 657 3,809 Waiting list at 31st March, 1952 10,712 New flats occupied during the year 298 Together with vacancies, transfers, etc., the total movement involved 736 families. Of a total of 34 bed-sitting room flats occupied during the past 12 months—27 have been let to people over 60 years of age. Your Public Health Department has co-operated with the Housing Department, as in previous years, in advising as to housing need in those cases where overcrowding is suspected or where medical grounds are advanced as being the need, or one of the causes of need, of rehousing. I have advised in 702 cases, informing Mr. Davey on each occasion the size of the family, the sex and ages of the children, the presence of sanitary defect,the number, size and location of the rooms occupied, and I have also advised as to the priority and particular needs that may be required by those who are suffering from illness or disability. It must be remembered, moreover, that the Council is the biggest manager of property in the borough, and I am calling the attention of the Housing Department almost daily to housing defects in the property managed by the Council. Admittedly few defects are found or cause complaint in property erected by the Council before the war or subsequently. It must be remembered, however, that the Council now becomes possessed of much property which in due course it will demolish with a view to embarking on further housing schemes. The management of this property is very difficult. It is very often old and dilapidated, and in many cases no repairs have been carried out in the past years. Tenants tend to expect that as soon as the Council becomes the owner every defect will be remedied. On the other hand, it obviously cannot be wise to spend large sums of money on property which is ultimately to be demolished, and by and large consideration has to be given as to whether property is so bad that the tenants should be housed as soon as possible, or, alternatively, what repairs are economically justifiable taking into consideration the life the property is expected to have. Conclusion. In ending these opening remarks to my annual report there is left for me now the very happy task of acknowledging the help and courtesy I have received throughout the year from you, Mr. Mayor, from the Aldermen and Councillors, and in particular from the members of the Public Health Committee. 13 I am, moreover, sincerely grateful for the help which I always receive so readily from the Town Clerk, the Borough Engineer, the Borough Treasurer, the Housing Manager and every officer of the Council. I speak not only for myself but for every member of the Public Health Department, for we realise that our achievements are but an outcome of the deliberations and encouragement of the Council we serve. I beg to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, DENNIS H. GEFFEN, Medical Officer of Health. 14 Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE.

Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930. The number of primary notifications during the year was 284, in addition to which 13 cases not previously notified came to knowledge by means of special death reports, and 96 by transfer from other districts. The total number of new cases from all sources was therefore 393, equal to a notification rate of 2.82 per 1,000 of population, compared with 376 new cases during the previous year, with a notification rate of 2.66 per 1,000 population. The deaths from all forms of tuberculosis during the year numbered 73, equal to a death rate of 0.52 per 1,000 of population, whereas the total number of deaths in the previous year was 76 with a death rate of 0.53. Out of the 73 deaths, 13 (being 17.8 per cent.) were of cases not previously notified as suffering from tuberculosis. The number of primary notifications of tuberculosis and those which came to knowledge by means of death reports and transfers from other districts as well as deaths during the year, are given in the following three tables:— Number of Primary Notifications.

The bulk of the water in the borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. In addition, wells situated outside the borough are a source of supply to various points on the railway system centred on Euston Station. There are also five wells in the borough, four being on factory premises and one at the Council's swimming baths at Prince of Wales Road, and from these a total of 19 samples were taken during the year and subjected to chemical and bacteriological examination by the Public Analyst. Examinations were also made of samples of water taken from Parliament Hill Lido, Ken Wood open air ponds, the Council's swimming baths and a private swimming bath. 43 Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933.

Requests were received from the London County Council during 1951 for confirmation of statutory overcrowding in respect of 445 applications for re-housing. Investigations were made by the Council's Sanitary Inspectors and details forwarded to the London County Council. 289 of these families were found to be overcrowded. In addition, my recommendations in respect of 702 cases referred to me by the Housing Department during the year were as follows :— Certificate "A" 329 "B" 111 "C" 179 "D" 83 National Assistance Act, 1948. Section 47—Care of Old Persons. During the course of the year we received 69 requests that we should investigate the conditions under which certain persons of retirement age were living. In most cases it was suggested to us that the individual concerned, by reason of age or infirmity, was unable to look after himself and that he/she should be removed to a hospital or an institution. A visit was made to the home in each case by one of your medical officers in conjunction with the Chief Sanitary Inspector or one of the inspectorial staff. The following table sets out the source of the original information and the action taken : Reported by No. of cases ACTION TAKEN Removed to hospital or institution Kept under observation at home together with the provision of various types of help Relatives 17 10 7 Medical practitioners 10 8 2 Friends and/or neighbours 9 2 7 Voluntary visitors, etc 13 6 7 Sanitary Inspectors 6 2 4 Home Help Department 3 1 2 Family Welfare Association 3 2 1 National Assistance Boards 1 1 — L.C.C. Visitor to the Blind 1 — 1 Member of Borough Council 3 2 1 Hospital Almoner 3 — 3 69 34 35 45 As a general practice it is our aim to keep old persons out of hospitals or institutions wherever this may be possible. The aged do not wish to leave their own homes, even when these homes consist only of one room. It will be seen from the above table that it was possible to make arrangements for over 50 per cent. of the persons we visited to remain at home. This was achieved by utilising the services of the various voluntary bodies in the borough, such as the Invalid Kitchens who supplied meals to those old people who were house-bound, the St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged who supplied wireless sets in some cases, a voluntary visitor, a holiday, and various other amenities. Most welcome assistance was received from the home help service of the London County Council. In other cases it was possible to arrange for the rooms of old people to be cleansed and re-decorated in order that a new start could be made under improved conditions. It is essential that constant supervision should be maintained. Visits of voluntary workers have been much appreciated and their reports to me on the health, happiness and requirements of those they visited have been of material assistance. It is with pleasure that I report that I did not need to obtain a Magistrate's Order for the compulsory removal of any person during 1951. Section 50—Burials. This section places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who dies or is found dead in the area, where no suitable arrangements are otherwise likely to be made. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have power to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of patients who die in hospital— in the case of mental patients, under section 258 of the Lunacy Act, 1890, as amended by the ninth schedule to the National Health Service Act, and in other cases under the common law. The Minister of Health, vide Circular 13/49 dated 1st March, 1949, asked these Hospital Committees and Boards to exercise this power. An arrangement has since been in force in St. Pancras whereby the Public Health Department carries out such burials on behalf of a number of the hospitals in the Borough, recouping expenses as far as possible and charging any balance to the hospitals. 89 burials were carried out during 1951, of which 48 were hospital cases, at a cost of £767 15s. 6d.—an average of £8 12s. 6d. per case. Recovery was effected of £716 16s. 7d.—an average of £8 Is. Id. per case or 93 • 36 per cent, of the total funeral cost—and was obtained from the following sources :— £ s. d. Hospitals 249 10 5 Death grants 123 7 0 Assurance Companies 34 12 2 Employers 10 16 7 Private persons 136 4 6 Other sources 20 9 1 Ministry of Pensions 20 14 5 Ministry of National Insurance 23 8 0 National Assistance Board 12 15 6 Post Office Savings Department 25 0 1 Treasury Solicitor 26 9 6 Sale of effects 4 10 0 Cash on Body 28 19 4 46 The net cost to the Borough Council for the whole year's working was therefore £50 18s. 11d.—an average of l1s. 5d. per case, or only 6.64 per cent. of the initial outlay. Blind Persons. There are 74 registered blind persons resident in the Borough of St. Pancras. During the year one was admitted to hospital, four left the borough and eleven died. Visits were paid at least once in the year to ascertain whether there were any sanitary defects requiring attention. Medical Examinations. Eighty-six medical examinations were carried out by myself and Dr. Tracy to ascertain whether personnel were fit for entry into superannuation or sick pay schemes or for special purposes. The following table sets out the results of such examinations :— New Entrants- Fit 59 Unfit 3 — 62 Special Examinations— Recommended to be retired on account of permanent ill-health or for employment not involving heavy manual strain 11 Recommended as capable to continue employment 5 Examined as to fitness to attend A.R.P. course—found to be fit 3 As to fitness to surrender part of superannuation—found to be fit 1 As to fitness for grave digging—found fit 2 night driving—found unfit 1 sewer flushing—found unfit 1 — 24 86 Mortuary and Coroner's Court.

Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act came into force on the 1st November, 1951, and requires inter alia (a) the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in manufacturing bedding, toys, baby carriages and other articles of upholstery, and (b) the annual licensing of premises where rag flock is (i) manufactured, or (ii) stored for distribution to registered premises. It is an Act to secure the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined.

The Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. These Regulations require, inter alia, the licensing of traders selling Pasteurised, Tuberculin Tested and Sterilised milks. The number of licences issued during 1951 was :— Main Licences Supplementary Licences To sell Pasteurised milk 147 24 To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 102 23 To sell Sterilised milk 168 23 The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951. This Order, issued by the Ministry of Food brought into operation in specified areas (including the County of London) as from the 1st October, 1951, the provisions of subsection (1) of section 19 of the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, relating to the compulsory use of special designations for retail sales of milk. This means that dairymen who retail milk in any part of the specified area must sell it under special designation, irrespective of whether the premises from which the milk is retailed are inside or outside the area. It is also obligatory to use a special designation in relation to milk sold to a caterer unless the caterer intends to pasteurise or sterilise the milk and is licensed to do so. Food Sampling. Chemical Examination. 1,193 samples (443 formal and 750 informal) were sent to the Public Analyst for chemical examination, of which seven formal and nine informal were found to be adulterated. Details of the nature of these samples are shown in the following table:— Formal. Informal. Genuine. Adulterated. Genuine. Adulterated. Milk 330 — 89 — Drugs — — 109 1 Sausages and meat products 39 3 45 1 Spirits 41 — — — Ice Cream — — 58* — Others 26 4 440 7 As from the 1st March, 1951, the Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951, became operative, prescribing the following minimum standards :— 5 per cent. fat. 10 per cent. sugar. 7½ per cent. milk solids other than milk fat. 53 The 58 samples of ice cream marked * above were taken during the ten months between 1st March and the end of the year and showed a fat content as follows:— Fat content per cent. Number of samples. Percentage of total samples. Over 14 1 1.72 13-14 3 5.15 12-13 2 3.45 11-12 2 3.45 10-11 3 5.15 9-10 8 13.80 8-9 10 17.26 7-8 6 10.35 6- 7 14 24.15 5- 6 9 15.52 Bacteriological Examination. In addition to the samples of food submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination. 374 samples were submitted either to the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, or the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, for bacteriological examination. (a) Milk. 152 samples of milk were taken from dairies and from London County Council schools, institutions and day nurseries in the Borough to ascertain whether they complied with the appropriate regulations relating to specially designated milks. The samples were subjected to the phosphatase test which indicates the efficiency of the method of heat treatment, and the methylene blue test indicating the keeping quality of the milk. All complied with the phosphatase test, and 145 proved satisfactory in regard to the methylene blue test. Appropriate action was taken in the remaining seven eases, and the follow-up samples were satisfactory. An analysis of these samples is given in the following table :— T.T. (Past) Past. Ster. H.T.

The improvement secured during previous years has therefore been maintained. Where unsatisfactory samples of ice cream were manufactured outside the Borough the Medical Officer of Health of the appropriate area was informed to enable him to investigate the conditions under which the commodity was produced. The following table shows the detailed results of the bacteriological examination of ice cream samples during the year and preceding years :— — 1948 1949 1960 1951 Samples % Samples % Samples % Samples % Satisfactory Grade I 75 41.7 59 32.4 59 44.7 86 48.31 Grade II 38 21.1 52 29.0 40 30.3 47 26.41 Unsatisfactor Grade III 31 17.2 44 24.6 15 11.4 26 14.61 Grade IV 36 20.0 25 14.0 18 13.6 19 10.67 Totals 180 100.0 180 100.0 132 100.0 178 100.00 (c) Synthetic cream. 36 samples of synthetic bakery filling cream were examined, of which all but three were reported to be satisfactory from a bacteriological point of view.

Two outbreaks occurred during the year, involving 40 persons but no deaths. In one (34 persons) the agent was identified as Clostridium welchii. The food suspected was individual steak puddings but none was available for bacteriological examination. In the second case (6 persons) neither the food nor the agent was positively identified. Clean Food Campaign. This work has been proceeding steadily during the year, mainly by the Council's Inspectors who regularly visited canteens and restaurants. Since the start of the campaign 85 lectures have been given at which there have been 2,440 attendances. Unsound Food Condemned and Destroyed. During the year 1951, the undermentioned unsound or diseased food was surrendered by the owners and dealt with by the Food Inspectors. Wherever possible the food was used for cattle feeding.
