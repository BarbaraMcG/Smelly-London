5 HAN 12 No. XVIII.] QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE Vestry of Saint George, Hanover Square, ON THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY IN THE PARISH, AND OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, FOB THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 29th, 1862, WITH THE ANNUAL SUMMARY. LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, upper ranelagh street, pimlico, s.w. TO THE Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, Again we are sorry to have to report a high rate of mortality, for the number of deaths in the whole parish during the quarter has been 609. This gives a gross weekly average of 46.8 deaths per week, whereas during the corresponding 13 weeks of the last ten years the average mortality was 472.5; that is to say at the rate of 36.5 per week; thus during the first quarter of the year 1862, 126 deaths have occurred above the average of the last ten years. The total number of deaths includes 71 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, and 4 in the Little Chelsea Workhouse. It is easy, from a glance at the subjoined table, to see where the excess lies:— Deaths under 20 in the whole parish. Total died. Hanover and May-fair. Belgravia. In the corresponding quarter of 1858 224 528 163 254 1859 203 457 116 235 1860 245 647 140 288 1861 213 540 133 273 1862 288 609 129 358 It thus clearly lies in the Belgrave Sub-district; for the deaths in the Hanover and May-fair, although a full average, are not very high, whereas the deaths in the 4 Belgrave Sub-district, exceed any number that yet appears in our tables. So however did the births likewise in the year 1861, when they amounted to 2119, or nearly a fourth more than the average in the Belgrave, whereas they did not exceed the average in the older part of the parish. Regarding the causes of mortality, zymotic diseases destroyed 116 lives, and of these diseases whooping-cough was the most fatal and destroyed 46 persons, all children under five. Scarlatina and diphtheria destroyed 29 persons, all under 20. The places in which these deaths occurred were chiefly Hanover-street, Pimlico, where 3 children died at No. 47, and one each at Nos. 62, and 72, and 22, Gillinghamstreet, where 2 children died. The deaths from measles were but 6. But with regard to the mortality from these diseases, it differs quarter by quarter and season by season, inasmuch as fevers that destroy 50 or 60 lives one quarter are absent the next; for instance, in the last quarter of 1861 we had 68 deaths from scarlatina and diphtheria, and only 18 from whooping-cough; this quarter the proportions are different: but always the bulk of the victims is the same—the children of the labouring classes. Typhus destroyed 18 lives, and affects adults by preference. Even more than zymotic disease, the weather is the chief agent in the destruction of life. This is chiefly shown by the number of deaths from lung disease, which amounted to 121. But cold confers an especial fatality, not only on diseases of the lungs, but on all diseases of degeneration and debility, amongst which scrofula and consumption are reckoned, and from which 81 persons died. All the causes of death which appear to show something wrong in the education and morals of the people, were particularly rife this quarter. Thus there were 9 5 deaths from burns and scalds. Six children are reported to have died of that form of slow torture called drynursing. There were 5 suicides; 2 infants suffocated; 4 found dead at home with no cause assigned; and 4 others newly born found in the streets, or in Hyde Park. Sixteen persons died of fractures from accidents. Eleven of these were non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. It may be noticed in passing, that 15 workmen employed in the building for the International Exhibition have died from accident in that hospital. In concluding this sketch of the mortality of the parish during the first quarter of the year, we cannot help remarking how clearly, as we analyse the death returns quarter after quarter, the influence of the leading circumstances which regulate the rate of mortality is marked out. They are, first the influence of climate, of excessive heat and cold, of undrained malarious land, and of exposure to wet. Secondly, overcrowded, illventilated and ill-drained houses, and want of personal cleanliness. Thirdly, the moral causes, the want of diligence, of acuteness, and above all the want of control over the lower appetites. It is from improved education and moral training of the lower classes that we must expect any decrease of the present death-rate. The Sickness. In the Hanover and May-fair Sub-districts, the number of persons who obtained out-door medical relief from the Parochial Surgeons, and from the Medical Officers of the Dispensary, Mount-street, and in the Sick Wards of the Mount-street Workhouse, was 997. Out of this number, 246, or a fourth, were affected with bronchitis, 6 1 each with pleurisy and pneumonia, and 2 with rheumatism. Of zymotic diseases, 2 were affected with chickenpox, 1 with measles, 14 with scarlatina, 16 with whoopingcough, 13 with diarrhoea, and 17 with continued fever. In the Belgrave Sub-district 7,086 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 3,560 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 3,526, who were treated at the other Institutions specified. We find the total number included 11 cases of chickenpox, 4 of measles, 26 of scarlet fever, 94 of whoopingcough, 4 of croup, 73 of diarrhoea, 7 of dysentery, 49 of continued fever, 40 of rheumatic fever, 9 of erysipelas, 5 of diphtheria, and 3 of ague. There were 780 cases of bronchitis, 10 of pleurisy, and 42 of pneumonia. C. J. B. Aldis, M.D. R. Druitt. 7 APPENDIX. No. I. water. An analysis of the water supplied by the Chelsea Company, and taken from the main at Chapel-street, Belgrave-square, January 17th, 1862, produced per gallon:— Total impurity 19.44 grains.

During this quarter, an examination was made of twelve specimens of coffee, purchased indiscriminately in the Belgrave Sub-district. In every case pure coffee was asked for. In nine, the samples obtained were pure; in three there were an admixture of chickory, although that substance was not asked for, and the admixture was not denoted by any label. R. D. 8 APPENDIX. No. III. The following table refers to cases dealt with by the Nuisances Removal Committee during the quarter ending March 29th, 1862:— Houses reported by Medical Officer of Health in consequence of illness or nuisance 55 Of these there were reported for fever 18 „ „ scarlet fever 23 ,, „ diarrhoea 2 „ „ diphtheria 3 Houses and other premises reported by Inspector 32 Ditto ditto by inhabitants 64 nature of nuisance complained of, and work effected. Obstructed drains cleansed and repaired 30 Cesspools abolished 9 Offensive water-closets repaired 6 New water-closets erected 6 Water laid on to water-closets 2 Old privies abolished 2 New pipe drainage laid down in houses 15 Overcrowding abated in kitchens 3 Slops thrown into roof gutters 1 Cisterns and water pipes repaired 8 Leakage of sewage water through walls 1 „ rain water 2 Dangerous structures referred to police 1 Premises wholly or partially whitewashed or cleansed 10 9 Dust-pits covered or repaired 2 Escape of gas 1 Vaults ventilated 1 Dung removed, dung-pits cleansed, &c. 17 Cow yard overcrowded 1 Lung nuisance in cow yard 1 Offensive slops thrown into street 1 Urinals complained of 6 New urinal erected at public bouse 1 Stable drains cleansed 11 Gas works complained of 1 Old public sewer under house repaired 1 Street gully cleansed 1 Special Cases. Hart's-buildings, Westhourne-street, Pimlico. At No. 1 the paving in the yard has been repaired, water laid on to the closet, the roof of the house repaired, and the water cistern covered. At No. 2 the drains with the water butt have been cleansed, and water laid on to the closet. At No. 3 the water closet has been repaired with the ceiling over it, and a new wall erected. At No. 4 the roof has been repaired, and No. 8 has been repaired and cleansed. The pavement belonging to the buildings has been repaired, the water tank covered, the privy repaired and cleansed, and water laid on. Equitable Gas Works. It was necessary to visit these works in consequence of a complaint, and to recommend a cover to be placed over the tank containing the ammoniacal liquor, the oxide of iron to be more carefully purified, and the foul water in the gas holders to be removed through a hose, all of which have been carried into effect. 10 Arsenical Paper. Samples of paper made with emerald green, and taken from two houses in the Out-wards, have been tested by Dr. Aldis, and found to be loaded with arsenic. The occupiers were warned of the risk they incurred in allowing it to remain on the walls. Amongst these special cases, it is as well to put on record that of No. 2, Shepherd's-market, in which a newly-built house, supposed to be well drained by pipes, was drenched by the reflux of its own sewage, which filled the cellars and the space under the kitchen floor, and poisoned the earth around. It was found that the pipe drain had not been connected with the sewer, but had been made to terminate in some old brick drain without an outlet. APPENDIX. No. IV. gas. Ninety-six observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the Works in Horseferry-road, 73 Bessborough-street, and 78 Cambridge-street respectively. Each experiment was made in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light required by the Act. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia, that they did not discolour the turmeric paper exposed under a pressure of five-tenths of an inch of water, except on February 5th, when the cannel gas from the Chartered Company presented traces of it. 11 The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases.

Annual Summary. Short Summary of Births, Deaths, Vaccinations, and Sanitary Statistics and Improvements, for One Year, from March 30th, 1861, to March 29th, 1862. Births. The number in the whole parish was 2,498. In the years ending April 1st, 1858, 1859, 1860 and 1861, the numbers were 2,165, 2,288, 2,300, and 2,119, respectively. In the Hanover and May-fair Sub-districts, there were; births 735, against 660, 705, 710, and 656 in the preceding four years successively; in the Belgrave, there were 1,763 against 1,505, 1,583, 1,590, and 1,463, in the preceding four years successively. Deaths. The gross number of deaths has been 1,965 against 1,768, 1,838, 1,837, and 1,769, in the four preceding years successively. The gross death-rate. If we estimate the population! at the end of 1861 at 88,500, was 22.2 per 1,000 living. Excess of Births over Deaths. This year 533 for the 12 whole parish. In the foregoing four years successively 397, 450, 463, and 350. District Mortality. The total number of deaths in St. George's Hospital was 328. The number of nonparishioners who died in St. George's Hospital was 243; in the preceding year 263. The number of parishioners who died there is 65; of whom 22 came from the Hanover and May-fair, and 43 from the Belgrave Sub-districts. In Mount-street Workhouse 69 persons died during the year ended March 29th, 1862. During the preceding four years the numbers were 88, 75, 72, and 96. In Little Chelsea Workhouse 27 against 41, 33, 28 and 25. If the 65 deaths of our parishioners in St. George's Hospital and the 96 in Mount-street and Little Chelsea Workhouses, equal 161, be compared with the total mortality 1,965, it will be seen that 1 person in every 12 who died within the parish this year, died in a public institution. In the Serpentine the deaths during the year have been 3, 1 infant and 2 adults. In Hyde Park 5 dead children have been found; 2 in the streets of the Hanover and May-fair Sub-districts. In the Hanover and May-fair Sub-districts the gross total mortality during the year ended 29th March, 1862, has been 570, including 69 in the workhouse, and 10 in the parks and streets. The numbers for the preceding five years in succession were 560, 605, 543, 567, and 534. This would give a gross death rate of 17.5 per thousand for this part of the parish, estimating the population as stationary at 32,418. Thus, during the last five years, the gross mortality of this part of the parish has fluctuated from 16 to 17 and 18 per 1,000 per annum. But we may divide this part of the parish into rich and poor, and take first that group of aristocratic and 13 first-class business streets, of which Albemarle, Arlington, North and South Audley, Bennett, Berkeley, New and Old Bond, Bolton, Upper and Lower Brook, and Bruton Streets are examples—all the first-class streets and squares in fact. The deaths in these streets were 187 this year; it was the same last year; the numbers for the foregoing five years being 216, 209, 192, 201, and 187. We obtained exact returns of the population of these streets at the Census of 1851, which was as nearly as possible 20,000 in round numbers, and has not varied materially since. The inhabitants of these houses, with their numerous servants, consist of adults in greater proportion, and fewer children than are to be found amongst the lower classes. They have education, wealth, leisure, pure air at home, and frequent change. The rate of death in these houses this year per thousand inhabitants has been 9.3, and during the last five years has fluctuated from 10 to 9, with a downward tendency. The proportion of deaths under 5 to deaths above that age is 43 to 144, or as about 2 to 7. Secondly, we may take the mews, the second and thirdrate business streets, and those occupied by the dwellings of the artisan population, of which we estimate the population at 13,000. Here are houses, every room of which contains a family of children, and whose inhabitants are too often without the intelligence, the money, the self-denial, the appreciation of the value of life, and the natural affection requisite for the preservation of their children's lives. This is the part of the population which sends one sixth or ninth or twelfth to die in workhouses and charitable institutions. Yet, if we take the deaths at home in the houses, they were last year 303, exclusive of all deaths in hospitals or elsewhere. The proportion of deaths of children under 5 in these houses, is as nearly as possible one-half, i.e., 154. 14 The death rate is 23.3 per thousand living. The rate has fluctuated during five years from 19 to 23, with a slight tendency to rise. The gross number of deaths in the Belgrave Subdistrict was 1,368. If we deduct the deaths in St. George's Hospital, the deaths at home were 1,060. There has been a rise during the last four years, the successive numbers being 813, 948, 926, and 880. Estimating the population at the close of the year as 56,500, the gross rate of mortality was 24.3 per 1,000 living; if we exclude the total deaths in St. George's Hospital, the rate of persons dying at home was 18.4 per 1,000 per annum. The deaths under 5 in the Belgrave Sub-district were 580, or nearly one-half the total mortality. It is now thoroughly understood that the death rate of a place gives no absolute information as to its salubrity; for the deaths out of any number of young children are so far in excess of the deaths of an equal number of adults, that unless we knew the numbers of various ages living, we could come to no useful conclusion. But the death rate amongst equal numbers of infants in any two places is one of the surest tests of salubrity; or if salubrity be equal, it is the surest test of the moral condition of the people. The following table will shew for the Belgrave Subdistrict what we have shown for the Hanover and Mayfair, namely, that the high rate of mortality is an evidence of the existence of children living under unfavourable conditions. For example, if we take five squares, Belgrave-square, Eaton-square, Chester-square, Ecclestonsquare, and Warwick-square, the deaths there during the year were 19, including 2 children under 5, and 17 persons above that age. But if we take a group of poor streets inhabited by the labouring classes, we find that out of 115 15 deaths, 82 were of children under 5, and 33 of persons above 5. mortality in five squares.

The total number of cases treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at the Dispensary, Mountstreet, was 3,803; amongst these were 4 cases of smallpox, 10 of chicken-pox, 56 of measles, 99 of scarlatina, 4 of diphtheria, 62 of whooping-cough, 473 of diarrhoea, 2 of dysentery, 3 of cholera, 2 of ague, 84 of fever, 3 of erysipelas, 636 of bronchitis and catarrh. In the Belgrave Sub-district 26,822 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and the workhouse, Little Chelsea; of these 13,872 were patients at St. George's Hospital. The whole number included 1 case of smallpox, 58 of chicken-pox, 122 of measles, 107 of scarlet fever, 222 of whooping-cough, 6 of croup, 1,169 of diarrhoea, 14 of dysentery, 196 of continued fever, 190 of rheumatic fever, 51 of erysipelas, 10 of diphtheria, 1 of pyœmia, 5 of carbuncle, and 9 of ague, 8 of which occurred in non-parishioners at St. George's Hospital. There were also 1,975 cases of bronchitis, 38 of pleurisy, and 106 of pneumonia. No patient has been sent by this parish to the Smallpox Hospital since July 1860 ; 9 were sent to the fever hospital during the year, including 4 children from No. 4, Eaton-court, North-row. Vaccination. During the year the total number of vaccinations performed by Mr. Jay, in the Hanover and May-fair Sub-districts, was 241; by Mr. Jorden, in the Belgrave Sub-district, 794. In order to find out children who have escaped vaccination, we make periodic enquiries and examinations at all the National and Parochial Schools. The number of children in the schools is as follows:— 17 St. George's, Hanover Square, Schools. Boys. Girls. Infants. Total. South-street 208 212 85 505 Hanover Schools, South Molton-st. 128 111 150 389 St. Mark's „ North Audley st. 125 125 140 390 Grosvenor School — 75 100 175 Curzon Schools 91 82 140 213 Farm-street School 35 35 25 95 Catholic School, Davies-mews,— Mixed School — — — 160 (Nearly half these children come from St. Marylebone.) St. Peter's School 230 160 305 695 St. Michael's School 279 229 282 790 St. Michael's Free School — — — 250 St. Gabriel's Schools 98 164 — 262 St. Paul's School 130 101 157 388 St. Barnabas' School 109 100 195 404 Eaton Chapel Schools 68 77 — 145 Catholic Schools, Belgravia — — — 130 4,991 In all of these schools it is a rule that no child shall be admitted who has not been vaccinated; in some of them, however, the rule falls, from time to time, into abeyance. In the process of inspecting the children we learn some facts which are quite as important as a few unvaccinated children. Some of the schools are extremely unfavourable for ventilation, and are too full of children. The infants are packed together too closely, so that the breeding and propagation of infectious disorders is promoted. The filthy state of the clothes and persons of some children should be remonstrated against by the 18 Mistresses and Committees of the schools. Children that have sore eyes, skin eruptions, and obvious marks of scrofula and rickets should be noticed, and the parents be urged to obtain medical and other treatment for them. The sale of bath tickets at a low price, to children from these schools, which the Commissioners of the Public Baths have kindly allowed, and the distribution of prizes for cleanliness, will be of some service. Sanitary Work.—The number of complaints entered in the Inspector's Report Book, between March 30th, 1861, and March 29th, 1862, is 799, of which 381 relate to premises in the Hanover and May-fair, and 418 to the Belgrave Sub-districts. The number of notices served has been 218. The number of premises regarding which the Committee for carrying out the Nuisances Removal Act authorize legal proceedings to be taken, if necessary, is 23 in the Hanover and May-fair, and 40 in the Belgrave Sub-districts. The number of summonses actually taken out has been 14, 7 in each district. Number of magistrates' orders, 1. Mr. Grant reports that there are 33 slaughter-houses, 18 cow-yards, and 38 marine store dealers in the parish. Our thanks are due to Mr. Jay, Mr. Jorden, and Mr. Hughes, the registrars; and to Messrs. W. Griffith, E. Davis, F. Godrich, sen., and W. Pain, of the Royal Pimlico Dispensary; to Mr. Connock of St. George's and St. James's Dispensary, Mount-street; and to Mr. Bloxam and Mr. W. Bloxam for much valuable information. C. J. B.

London: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. TO THE Vestrg of St. George, Hanover Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, During the 13 weeks ended June 28th, 1862, 453 deaths were registered, including those of 65 non- parishioners at St. George's Hospital, and of 8 inmates at Little Chelsea Workhouse. The average mortality of the corresponding weeks of the 10 years previous was, in round numbers, 433; so that 20 deaths occurred in this quarter in excess of that average; an excess less than might have been expected from our rapidly increasing population. The table annexed to this report shews that zymotic disease destroyed 79 persons, whereas in the corresponding period of 4 years it fluctuated between 89, 80, 81, and 84, giving an average of 83. Amongst the deaths were 10 of parishioners from scarlet fever, which occurred respectively in Lee's-mews, Hart-street, Tom's-court, Grosvenor-place, Wilton-terrace, Elizabeth-place, Princes-row East, and Robert-street, Pimlico. Diphtheria proved fatal to 5 parishioners, and to 1 non-parishioner at St. George's Hospital. One died in Mount-row, 2 in South Audley-street, 1 in Stockbridgeterrace, and 1 in Sutherland-street. Twenty-five persons died from typhus fever, 3 of whom were non-parishioners 4 at St. George's Hospital, and there were 68 deaths from lung diseases, besides 60 from consumption. Among the accidental deaths we notice one of a labourer from fracture of the skull, which was struck by a screw propeller at the International Exhibition. Another'died from a fractured thigh and other injuries through falling from a scaffold at No. 23, Grosvenor-square. A child was killed by wounds in the groin, received when in the arms of her father, who fell while crossing Oxford-street. Three deaths occurred from poison, one from opium taken during intoxication, a second from swallowing an embrocation in mistake for medicine, and a third from apoplexy induced by morphia, but there was no evidence to shew whether it was taken accidentally or not. The patient was found insensible in Charlotte-street, Pimlico. A child aged 1 year was scalded to death by hot tea from a pot pulled over by himself on to his chest and stomach at No. 2, Robert-street, Pimlico. A boy aged 10 fell from a barge, while playing, into the river Thames, Thames Bank. Moreover 2 persons were found in the Serpentine without evidence how they came there. Among the violent deaths we observe that an infant was found on the shore of the river Thames, Pimlico, with a ligature round its head and mouth, another was also found in Hyde Park strangled with ribbons. Four deaths from suicide were registered, namely, one of a man aged 52, who wounded himself in the throat with a knife at No. 10, Little Chester-street, another of a glazier, aged 37, who was discovered hanging by a cord to the bough of a tree in Hyde Park, the third a women, aged 35, who was found dead in the cellar at No. 90, New Bond-street, after having strangled herself with a cord, and the fourth a non-parishioner at St. George's 5 Hospital, who poisoned himself with corrosive sublimate when insane. An infant was supposed to have been suffocated while in bed with its mother at No. 38, Churtonstreet; another was found under the boards of the landing at No. 2, St. George's-square, supposed to have been there more than two years. Besides these, 2 infants were found dead in Hyde Park, a third in South Audley-street, a fourth with the body mutilated in the Chelsea Hospital Grounds, a fifth at the shrubbery in Grosvenor-road, and a sixth was found dead in Hyde Park from hemorrhage from the umbilical cord. During this quarter, the number of persons, who have received medical attendance from the Parochial Surgeons, at the Dispensary, and in the sick wards of the Workhouse Mount-street has been 848. Amongst them were 22 cases of measles, 5 of scarlatina, 10 of whooping-cough, 25 of diarrhoea, 1 of dysentery, 13 of continued fever, 2 of erysipelas, 96 of bronchitis and catarrh, 4 of diphtheria, and 1 of pneumonia. The places which attracted most attention from the number of cases of sickness in them were George-street, Robert-street, Hart-street, Grosvenor-mews, and several houses in Lancashire-court. In the Belgrave Sub-district, 6776 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul's and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the "Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 3828 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 2948. We find that the total included 18 of chicken-pox, 6 of measles, 27 of scarlet-fever, 22 of whooping-cough, 129 of diarrhoea, 3 of dysentery, 70 of continued fever, 6 68 of rheumatic fever, 3 of diphtheria, 19 of erysipelas, 2 of carbuncle, 10 of croup, and 8 of ague, 4 of which occurred in non-parishioners at St. George's Hospital. There were 395 cases of bronchitis, 11 of pleurisy, and 40 of pneumonia. We have the honour to be, Your faithful Servants, C. J. B. Aldis, M.D. E. Druitt. 7 APPENDIX. No. I. WATER.

No. III. SPECIAL CASES. Although it is considered expedient not to publish the details of these cases of nuisance, yet it may be allowed us to add one word of commentary. It is worthy of notice to how large an extent the superior classes of ratepayers trust to the judgment of the Sanitary Committee and its officers, insomuch that in very many cases of nuisance in the better class of houses all the operations for the relief of them are executed under the directions of the Committee, and of course occupy a considerable amount of the Inspector's time. We may mention New Bond-street, Blenheim-street, Albemarle-street, Mountstreet, Park-street, Great Stanhope-street, and Chesterfield-street as places where such operations have been carried on this quarter, and that in respect of 5 first-class premises in these situations there occurs the following entry: "Old brick drains broken up and removed, cesspool abolished and filled up, new pipe drains laid down, and inlets trapped." This may be mentioned to give an idea of the money interests involved, and of the gradual improvement which is silently being effected in the salubrity of our parish. 10 The Committee had to adjudicate in a curious case in Stafford-street. It was this. There is a public house which has in its yard as appendages to the business, a water closet and urinal. These places are well constructed, and as inoffensive as such places can be in the yard of a public house where they are visited from morning to night. But they are situated close under the windows of a bed room on the ground floor of the next house. This bed room is very unwholesome, and the only air it receives is tainted by the aforesaid places. The owner of the bed room therefore complains to the Committee and brings a file of medical certificates; of the bad effects of this room on the health of the inmates there can be no doubt. He asks them to compel the landlord to shut up or remove the closet and urinal. The Committee think on the one hand that it would be a serious precedent if they were to interfere with such places on a man's own premises, if they are well constructed and kept clean. If they were to do so, complaints would pour in from every street. On the other hand, the owner of the bed room came confessing that the room was unhealthy, and from the evidence of the medical officer it was manifestly deficient in air and light, independently of any nuisance from without. The Committee therefore desired the medical officer to apply to the Magistrate at Marlborough-street for his opinion. The Magistrate's Clerk declined to grant a summons against the publican unless his urinal &c. were dirty;—which they were not;—and advised that no application should be made for a summons against the owner of the bed room, inasmuch as it would be shabby to turn round on a man and bring his own complaints in evidence against him. The contending parties, thus left to themselves, settled the matter by private arrangement; the urinal 11 was removed, and the bed room better ventilated;—as they were advised to be done by the Committee at the beginning of the proceedings. A case of trade nuisance in North-row has been investigated. The husks given off in the process of roasting coffee entered the bed room windows of the next house to such an extent that the windows could not be opened. After a longer negociation than there should have been, the coffee roasting premises were guarded by gauze blinds, so that no husks could escape. Lead Works between Lupus-street, and Effingham-street, Belgravia. These premises had been closed for about 4 years; meanwhile new houses were constructed close to them, and the inhabitants have complained loudly against the manufacture of white lead, which has been lately recommenced. The sheds are situate behind the houses and are divided into 10 large enclosures by party walls, which do not extend to the roof so that a communication exists between all the spaces or beds, where 8 stacks, averaging 15 feet high, are erected. Spent tan is laid down on the ground with glazed earthenware pots containing diluted vinegar. The crates of lead are placed upon these pots, and over all, boards are arranged to form a floor for the next layer of tan, when the operation is repeated. To increase the heat and fermentation of the tan the whole was walled in with horse dung. During this process a disagreeable vapour escaped through the open tiles into the houses and caused the present complaint. Frequent inspections have been made and several of the Nuisances Removal Committee visited the works on August 26th. It has been recommended that the tiles should be 12 pointed, that the use of horse dung be discontinued and brick walls erected instead, and that a ventilating shaft be constructed higher than the adjoining houses. The proprietors being most ready and willing to carry out any suggestions have already incurred considerable expense. APPENDIX. No. IV. GAS. Eighty observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the Works in Horseferry-road, 73 Bessborough-street, 78 Cambridge-street, and No. 1 Ebury Bridge-road respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light, except on April 24th, when the cannel gas from the London Company gave a light equal to 17.6 7 instead of 20 sperm candles. With regard to the purity of the gases, they were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that they did not discolour the turmeric paper. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases. Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 24.37 22.55 25.84 Common 14.14 14.67 15.03 A Table and Summary were sent with each monthly re- 13 port on the gas to the vestry, containing the number of examinations with the dates, and the maximum and minimum light, with the weekly and monthly average illuminating power. The experimental apparatus has been removed from the testing room in Ebury-mews to the new room at No. 1, Ebury Bridge-road, where an additional meter has been provided for testing the common gas supplied by the London Company.

Lonon: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. TO THE Vestry of St. George Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, During the 13 weeks ended 27th September, 1862, we have to report 407 deaths in the parish, including those of 70 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, and 5 inmates in the Little Chelsea Workhouse. The average mortality of the parish during the corresponding weeks of the last 10 years was 391; so that the number of deaths during the present quarter would be considerably below the average, if allowance were made for our greatly increased population. The deaths from zymotic disease have been 80; and amongst these 18 were due to diarrhoea. Total deaths. Do. of zymotio disease. Diarrhoea, dysentery, & cholera. In the 3rd quarter of 1858 412 125 35 1859 440 116 62 1860 380 79 17 1861 410 104 36 1862 407 80 18 The coolness of the weather, and absence of diarrhoea characterized this summer as they did the summer of 1860. It is worthy of remark that out of the 18 victims of 4 diarrhoea, 16 were children under 5, and 2 aged persona above 60. With the deaths of these 16 children from diarrhoea, must be classed those of 10 who died of want of breastmilk, in other words, want of power in those who had the charge of them to find a food which they should be able to digest. Amongst these were three infants in the Little Chelsea Workhouse; but then it must be remembered that the condition in which these children often are when they are brought into that establishment is such as to defy any care or skill on the part of those who nurse them. A child who having been for a time neglected, is then drugged to keep it quiet, packed up in a basket and left in the street, where it is sometimes exposed to drenching rain before it is discovered, has so little vitality that all efforts to save it are often fruitless. The deaths from measles are but 3; scarlatina, diphtheria, croup, and sore throat together produced 25 deaths. This number is about the usual average of the corresponding quarters. The places where these deaths chiefly occurred are Grosvenor-cottages, Robert-street Belgravia, Morton-place, Philips-place, Ebury-square, Ranelagh-gardens, Coleshill-street, and others amongst the lower part of the Belgrave Sub-district. During this quarter the Hanover and May-fair Sub-districts have been comparatively free from these diseases. Yet there have been deaths from diphtheria in Hay'smews, Grovenor-mews, Woodstock-street, and Daviesmews. There were 17 deaths from fever of various kinds. Amongst these four were non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital; one girl of 15, who was brought from 6, Boyd'sgardens, to the workhouse, Mount-street, and died there ; 5 and the son of a photographer in Oxford-street, residing in a house of which the drainage was excessively out of order. The deaths from bronchitis, only 13, and the total mortality from lung disease only 26 testify to the season. In the winter quarter they have been so many as 150. Amongst the accidental deaths, we notice three from burns, two of them amongst our own parishioners;—viz., the daughter of a labourer, one year old, at Robert's-buildings, Ebury-street, whose clothes were found on fire, no evidence how; a maid-servant of 21, in Lupus-street, whose clothes caught fire through a lucifer-match which had been thrown on the ground, and a girl of 8, from Stanleybridge, daughter of a labourer, whose clothes caught fire from a candle. One boy of 8, son of a labourer, was found in a stable with his skull fractured by the kick of a horse. A child of 2 was knocked down and run over by a cart. A boy of 9, had his leg fractured by a waggonwheel which passed over it in St. George's-road. One man died of a wound of the arm inflicted by a machine in the Great Exhibition. There were two suicides. Respecting the infants' deaths, the body of one was found in the Grosvenor-dock, and the jury at the inquest found by a verdict that it was still-born. This induces us to repeat what we have said before, viz., that the children whose bodies are found in the streets, the park, or the water of the Sepentine or Thames, must not be assumed to be all murdered. Some of them are undoubtedly stillborn;—some murdered—some so decomposed when found that it is impossible to say what may have been the mode of death ; but most certainly in many cases the discovery of the body is evidence only of the simple fact, that the parents were too poor to bury a still-born child, and took 6 the summary though scarcely decent mode of throwing it away—or that the undertaker did so. We think that these matters ought to be made known, in order that measures may be taken, if it should be desirable, for lessening this public scandal. The sickness. In the Hanover and May-fair Sub-districts, the number of patients which appears in the books of the Medical Officer of the Workhouse, and of the Dispensary, Mount-street, and of the Parochial Medical Officers, is 983. Amongst them were 1 case of chicken-pox, 9 of measles, 3 of scarlatina, 16 of whooping-coughs, 168 of diarrhoea, 27 of fevers, 75 of bronchitis, 2 of diphtheria, 1 of pleurisy, and 2 of pneumonia. On the whole it cannot be said that there has been much sickness amongst the poorer population, considering their mode of life and crowded habitations. Nevertheless our experience shews constantly that wherever an unusual number of cases of sickness occurs, there is ground for a visitation. Perhaps a first visit discovers nothing particularly wrong: nothing beyond the ordinary dinginess of a poor house. But subsequent visits occasioned by fresh cases of illness, if they do not discover a serious nuisance, may either induce the poor tenants to shift their quarters, or may induce the house-owner to cause the house to be cleansed or otherwise improved in a way which we could not attain by legal compulsion. For instance, there is a house in Robert-street, Grosvenor-square, containing 11 families. In the week ending 3rd May, we learn of a case of diphtheria; 28th June, case of sore throat, and one of diarrhoea; 5th July, case of diarrhoea; 19th, case of sore throat, and one of debility ; August 2nd, case of dyspepsia; September 7th, two cases of diarrhoea. The radical defect of this house was 7 want of air, which after a long struggle has been supplied by means of a new window to the staircase. There was besides a defect in the drainage owing to the culpable carelessness of the inmates. In Lancashire-court, during the last six months, there were eight cases of slight fever amongst children, one of diphtheria, two of possibly contagious ophthalmia, one of diarrhoea, and two of sore throat. Two houses were found in which the water had been cut off, and one kitchen which had been disused as a dwelling place was used again by a new tenant; these things were remedied, and every house in the court subjected to as much cleansing and repair as could legally be demanded. After such operations, it is our experience that sickness of certain sorts absents itself for a time. Then in a year, the whole process has to be repeated. In the Belgrave Sub-district 7,597 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these 4,542 were patients at St. George's Hospital. The total figures include 17 cases of chicken-pox, 9 of measles, 102 of scarlet fever, 16 of whooping-cough, 381 of diarrhoea, 40 of continued fever, 29 of rheumatic fever, 14 of erysipelas, 7 of diphtheria, 2 of carbuncle, and 1 of ague. There were 211 cases of bronchitis, 15 of pleurisy, and 24 of pneumonia. We have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your faithful Servants, C. J. B. Aldis, M.D. R. Druitt. 8 APPENDIX.

This set of house has heretofore been exceedingly unhealthy at times, and various improvements have been made; now, we believe, a great step has been made, in the substitution of pipes for old brick drains and cesspools. There was a huge cesspool under the very floor of a house which is occupied as a kind of mission-house, for the benefit of the working classes. A dispute has been investigated by the Committee between the owners of adjacent houses in Portugal-street and Mount-street. A case of nuisance was established; but it was so intermixed with questions of private right— for example, the right to have a window opening into a neighbour's yard—that the Committee counselled a private arrangement between the parties concerned. This was effected with very great pains; but was afterwards set aside, and when last heard of the parties were engaged in a law-suit. 11 No. 7, Johnson's-place, Lupus-street, Pimlico. A woman was found lying here in a horrible state. A dreadful stench pervaded the room, arising from the filthy condition of her clothes and bedding which were saturated with foul discharges from a large ulcer in one of her legs and covcred with live maggots. Twelve publican's cans and some flower-pots were filled with excrement. She was taken to the Westminster Hospital. The bed-clothes, mattreses, and rotten linen were ordered to be burnt, and the room was cleansed. King's Scholar's Pond Sewer. We are happy to state that the open part of this sewer which passes by the Equitable Gas Works, Pimlico, has been covered over by private subscription. APPENDIX. No. III. GAS. Seventy-eight observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the works in Horseferry-road, 73, Bessborough-street, and 78, Cambridge-street, respectively, besides others at No. 1, Ebury Bridge-road. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light, excepting on August 6th, when the cannel gas from the London Company gave a light equal to 19.68, instead of 20 sperm candles. With regard to the purity of the gases, they were 12 free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that they did not discolour the turmeric paper exposed under a pressure of five-tenths of an inch of water. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases. Chartered. London. Equitable.

HAN 12 No. XXI.] QUARTERLY SUMMARY OF THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY IN THE PARISH OF Saint George, Hanover Square, AND OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICEBS OP HEALTH, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 27th, 1862. London: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. TO THE Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, In the 13 weeks that ended December 27th, 1862, the number of deaths in the parish was 469, giving a weekly average of 36. This number is not so high as that of the corresponding period of the previous year when the deaths were 535, giving a weekly average of 41. The present deaths include those of 50 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, and of 7 of our parishioners in Little Chelsea Workhouse. The average number of deaths in the parish during the corresponding period of the last ten years has been 403.l, and the weekly average for the same time 31. The deaths from zymotic diseases in the quarter were 99 against 144 in the fourth quarter of 1861. Among them we notice 14 deaths from measles, 24 from scarlet fever, 9 from diphtheria, 8 from quinsy, croup and sore throat, 11 from whooping-cough, 10 from diarrhoea, and 10 from typhus fever, one of which occurred in a non-parishioner at St. George's Hospital. The deaths from measles happened principally in the following streets, namely, Hanover-place Bond-street, May's-buildings, Hertford-place, Eobson's-yard, "West- 4 bourne-place, Ranelagh-cottages, Hanover-street, Charlwood-place, Caroline-street, Whitaker-street, Upper Ebury-street, Eaton-mews West, and Pulford-street. Deaths from scarlet fever were registered as having taken place in Thomas-street, Duke-street, Mount-street, New Bond-street, Belgrave-mews East, Wilton-mews, Gillingham-street, Glasgow-terrace, Hanover-street, Brewer-street, Churton-place, Cumberland-street, Caledoniaplace, Hindon-terrace, Stockbridge-terrace, Allingtonstreet, Windsor terrace, and Hindon-place. Diphtheria proved fatal to a boy of 5 in Steel's-court, a boy of 3 in Queen's-street, Oxford-street, a girl of 2 in Chapel-yard, a child of 6 months in Street's-buildings, a man of 38, a journeyman painter, in the Workhouse Mount-street, a boy of 1 in Ebury-mews, a man of 53 in Hugh-street, a girl of 1 in Hugh-street West, and a child in Little Chester-street. A death from quinsy occurred in Swan-passage, and another in Denbigh-street, and one from sore throat in Berwick-street. Deaths from croup happened in the following streets, namely, Thomas-street, Ranelagh-street, Bridge-row, Denbigh-street, Union-street, and the Queen's Royalmews. A death from small-pox occurred at No. 2, Robertstreet, Pimlico, November 22, in a man aged 30, unvaccinated, who worked on the premises lately occupied by Mr. Kelk. The patient would not be removed to the Small Pox Hospital. A house to housg visitation was made in the street, and the few children who required it, were vaccinated by Mr. Jorden. Typhus fever proved fatal to the widow of a butler in Chapel-street, to a young lady in Brook-street,—a child in 5 Hamilton-mews,—a woman in Hart-street,—a girl in Cumberland-street,—a boy in Eaton-place,—a plumber in Upper Ebury-street,—and a missionary in Moretonplace. There were ten deaths from diarrhoea. Lung diseases have destroyed 84 persons, and 43 died of consumption. The following Table shows the number of deaths in the parish from the same causes during the fourth quarter of the preceding four years: Lung diseases in 1858 . 95 Consumption 53 „ „ 1859 . 77 „ 56 „ „ 1860 . 69 „ 46 1861 . 71 „ 64 Five persons died from the effects of intemperance; viz., a gentleman aged 27 from delirium tremens, a licensed victualler aged 44, a broker's man aged 46, a coachman, a non-parishioner who died in the hospital, and besides these a woman aged 56. Two persons died from fractures and four from burns and scalds in St. George's Hospital. Five of them were non-parishioners. Among the deaths from causes not specified or illdefined are included those of seven infants, 3 of whom were found dead and decomposed in Hyde-park, 1 in Cumberland-street, another in Upper Belgrave-terrace, 1 in the Workhouse Mount-street, and 1 in Grafton-street. Three infants were overlaid, one in Robert-street, Grosvenor-square, another 4 months old in Brick-street, when in bed with its parents, and a third in Robert-street, who was suffocated when in bed with its mother and putative father. 6 Two men committed suicide. One a non-parishioner who took essential oil of bitter almonds when insane, died in the hospital; the other a coachman aged 35, drowned himself in the serpentine. In the Hanover and May-fair sub-districts, the number of persons who received gratuitous medical attendance at the Dispensary in Mount-street, at the hands of the Parochial Surgeons, and in the Sick Wards of the Workhouse, was 1010. Amongst these were 1 case of small-pox, 22 of measles, 11 of scarlet fever, 7 of whooping-cough, 22 of diarrhoea, 1 of dysentery, 15 of continued fever, 4 of erysipelas, 231 of bronchitis, 5 of diphtheria, 1 each of pneumonia and pleurisy, and 24 of various kinds of sore throat. The case of small-pox was that of a woman aged 46, wlio resided in Bermuda-street, Mile-end, where she contracted this disease, and came in a street cab, ill with it, to a sister's at No. 10, Robert-street, Grosvenor-square, on the 17th December. On the next day she was sent in the parish conveyance to the Small-pox Hospital. It may be permitted to state that she returned to Robert-street on the 5th January, and that an adult man in that house has since been infected with the disease. Both had been vaccinated when young. A case of small-pox is also reported to have occurred at a private house in Park-lane. No others have been heard of. In the Belgrave sub-district 6,653 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul's and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 4,455 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 2,198. 7 We find that the total included 6 of small-pox, 21 of chicken-pox, 143 of measles, 38 of scarlet fever, 31 of whooping-cough, 151 of diarrhoea, 6 of dysentery, 45 of continued fever, 47 of rheumatic fever, 8 of diphtheria, 22 of erysipelas, 1 of carbuncle, 3 of croup, and 2 of ague, which occurred in non-parishioners at St. George's Hospital. There were 579 cases of bronchitis, 10 of pleurisy, and 31 of pneumonia. SMALL POX. The small-pox having appeared in several parts of Belgravia, a special committee was summoned on November 27th to consider the subject. The disease first occurred at St. George's Hospital in a school boy, aged 7, who resided in Lloyd's-place, Brompton, and was admitted into the Hospital on October 24th, for fever. But the " fever" turned out to be small-pox; whereupon the patient was placed in a private room instead of being sent to the Small-pox Hospital; a new remedy sarracenia purpurea was tried, and he was discharged cured on November 14th. As four other patients became infected with the complaint besides a student of the Hospital residing in Shaft.esbury-crescent, the committee thought it wrong that the patient first attacked should have been allowed to remain in the Hospital. The other four patients were transferred to the Small-pox Hospital, two in common cabs and two in the parochial conveyance. The spreading of the disease had created alarm enough to drive other patients away from the Hospital. It was resolved that a letter be written to the Secretary of the Hospital complaining of the preceding circumstances. 8 Printed notices were circulated urging the necessity of having all unvaccinated children vaccinated without delay. They contained the address of the public vaccinators, the liability of parents and guardians being fined if they neglected to have children duly vaccinated in accordance with the Act, and all the necessary information.

The following may be quoted as an instance of the necessity of some system of inspection of the dwellings of the working classes. Whilst making a round of visits 13 of this kind, one of us entered a room at No. 5, Thomasstreet, Grosvenor-square, and discovered a coffin containing the body of a child who had died of some affection of the throat, another child in bed with the same complaint, two other children in the room, and two tailors at work on the floor;—the room and all its contents being in a most astonishing state of filth and stench, and the father of the family refusing to open the window, lest the fresh air should hasten decomposition of the corpse. The owner of the house said that they earned good wages, but preferred dirt to cleanliness, and that he could not get rid of them. Accordingly, in order to get rid of so dangerous a nuisance, an order was served requiring the owner to remove the dead body, and cleanse the apartment, and not use it for habitation till it had been so cleansed. This was on Saturday the 8th, and the room was empty and in the process of cleansing on Tuesday the 11th October. New Grosvenor-place, Pimlico. No less than eighteen houses have undergone sanitary improvement in this place in reference to trapping sinks, whitewashing and cleansing rooms, &c., the repairing of roofs, the erection of and covering of dust pits, the cleansing and erection of water butts, the repairing of drains, pavement, and supply-pipes to closets. APPENDIX. No. III. slaughterhouses and cowhouses. We conjointly examined the thirty-seven premises, respecting which notices had been given of application for licenses for slaughtering. We found that they were 14 for the most part fit for the purpose; and that some of them, to which exception might be taken from their proximity to other buildings, may be used provided the occupiers continue to fulfil the conditions which they consented to when applying for their licenses. The 93 clause of the " Metropolis Local Management Act" having required that the cowhouses should be put under the same restriction as the slaughterhouses with regard to their being licensed, we personally examined and measured, with the aid of Mr. Grant, the various premises in the parish used as cowsheds which are eighteen in number. A return of these in a tabular form was sent to the Vestry containing the date and hour of each visit, the situation, names and addresses of occupiers, information regarding light, ventilation, paving, drainage, water supply, dung pits, grain bins, number of animals, number of standings, condition of animals, space of stalls, dimension of sheds, cleansing, limewashing, removal of manure, height of sheds, and proximity to dwellings with remarks. The number of proprietors was 21, and the number of animals 477. An undertaking also was printed and circulated to be signed by every applicant for a license. It enjoined periodical limewashing of the sheds and yards, the receptacles for grains to be properly constructed, the daily removal of dung, the proper washing of the sheds twice every day, the prevention of offal or rubbish being thrown into the dung pits, and the number of cows to be fixed by the Officers of the Yestry subject to the decision of the magistrate. 15 APPENDIX. No. IY. gas. Eighty-four observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the works in Ilorseferry-road, 73, Bessborough-street, and 78, Cambridge-street, besides others at No. 1, Ebury Bridge-road, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, I860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light, excepting on October 9th, when the cannel gas from the London Company gave a light equal to 18*39, instead of 20 sperm candles. It may be remembered that I was unable to make experiments at No. 4, Cannon-row, the testing room provided by the Chartered Company, in consequence of a fire that occurred on the premises, and I have again recently been prevented from doing so by the box photometer taking fire, which will account for my continuing the experiments at the works in Horseferry-road. With regard to the purity of the gases, they were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that they did not discolour the turmeric paper exposed under a pressure of five-tenths of an inch of water. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases. Chartered. London. Equitable. Cannel 25.36 23.79 25.87 Common 13.71 13.59 14.55 16 A Table and Summary were sent with each monthly report on the gas to the Vestry, containing the number of examinations with the dates, and the maximum and minimum light, with the weekly and monthly average illuminating power.
