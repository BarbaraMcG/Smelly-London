LEWIS Page 4 TOWN HALL, BARKING, ESSEX December 1961 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Barking Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting this report on Dr.Groarke's behalf, I should like to thank my colleagues and members of the Council for the help they have given during the year under review. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, M-I.Adamson Medical Officer of Health Page 5 GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH SHORTAGE OF HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION During 1960, the plans for the major developments at the Barking Hospital were well in hand and it is hoped that within the next few years Barking will have its own general hospital. HEALTH EDUCATION During the year staff, principally medical officers, health visitors and public health inspectors, took every opportunity to teach the main essentials of health education to the people of Barking. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948 It was unfortunately necessary during the year to take power under the Act for the compulsory removal of three persons who were no longer capable of caring for themselves at home and who were unwilling voluntarily to enter hospital. The first case was an old lady of 84 years who lived alone and refused all offers of assistance. She was admitted to St. George's Hospital, Hornchurch, where after several weeks, she appeared to settle down happily although somewhat confused mentally. The other cases were a brother and sister aged 74 and 78 years respectively, who lived together and who both became progressively less able to manage. They had been maintained at home for several years with the services of a domestic help and a weekly bathing visit, but eventually it became necessary to admit them to "The Willows", Hornchurch, which is maintained by the Essex County Council. WELFARE SERVICES The following information was kindly supplied by the County Welfare Officer of the Essex County Council:- "The table indicates the extent to which the various services provided by the County Council under the provisions of the National Assistance Act 1948 have been afforded to persons having residence in the Borough Page 6 of Barking during 1960. Residential accommodation for aged persons continues to be developed to meet the increasing demand and a newly purpose built home is in course of erection in Barking and when completed will accommodate 62 persons. Welfare Services for blind and other classes of handicapped persons are available in many ways; these include home visitation by specialised field workers, tuition in handicrafts (and braille for the blind), recreational and holiday facilities and, especially for the handicapped person, the supply of home aids, gadgets and hoists, and in addition the Welfare Committee give financial assistance towards the cost of structural alterations designed to help the handicapped person in overcoming his disability. There is an occupational centre specially for physically handicapped persons at Barking, and this is proving a great asset to those able to attend, of whom 24 live in the Borough."

Page 9 Maternal Mortality There was one tragic maternal death during the year following a self-induced abortion. The woman concerned sought no medical care. Loss of Infant Life The infant death rate in 1960 was 18.07 as compared with 28.95 for 1959. The national figures for these years were 21.7 and 22.2 respectively. The following tables show the causes of infant deaths:- INFANTILE MORTALITY - 1960 Cause of Death Age at Death 0-1 mth. 1-3 mths. 3-6 mths. 6-9. mths. 9-12 mths.

Adjusted Death Rate (Comparability Factor 1.41) = 13.08. INFECTIOUS DISEASES The following notifications were received during the year:- Notifications Scarlet Fever 98 Whooping Cough 94 Tuberculosis:- Respiratory 41 Non-Respiratory 3 Measles 36 Pneumonia 35 Dysentery 22 Puerperal Pyrexia 9 Scabies 8 Food Poisoning 4 Erysipelas 1 Pemphigus Neonatorum 1 The numbers of notifications received during 1960 did, in the main go down a, compared with 1959, with the exception of whooping cough where an increase from 8 to 94 was recorded. This might be said to be a reflection on our immunisation programme bu it has never been claimed that immunisation would eradicate Page 11 whooping cough but only that it would materially minimise the severity of the attack. It is pleasing to report that not one single case of poliomyelitis was notified in the Town during the year. CARE OF THE AGED Throughout the year Health Visitors have endeavoured to visit the aged more frequently in their homes, and increasing use is made of the sick room equipment scheme. One of the most appreciated services which is given on the recommendation of the Health Visitor's visit is domiciliary chiropody. This is provided by the Barking Old People's Welfare Com mittee and at the end of the year 242 old people were receiving this service, an increase of 32 over the previous year. It is interesting to note that the average age of the people receiving this service was 79 years. Again during the year there has been constant and cordial contact with hospitals receiving the chronic sick and with the County Welfare Department. ESTABLISHMENTS FOB MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Licences were issued during the year in respect of four estab lishments which are governed by the Borough's bye-laws, LAUNDRY SERVICE The laundry service for the chronic sick and elderly, operated by the Borough Council has again proved invaluable and during 1960, 48 cases were assisted regularly. This involved the laundering of 11,726 articles. PATHOLOGICAL SERVICE Our association with the Pathological Department of the Ilford and Barking Hospital Group Pathological Service has remained one of excellent co-operation and I should like to give my personal thanks to Dr.Elias-Jones and his staff at the Bark ing Hospital Laboratory for the unfailing help rendered to us. Page 12 Unfortunately, we cannot yet state that these laboratory services are used one hundred per cent by the mothers-to-be of Barking, although it is interesting to note that, with the introduction of the bus service along Upney Lane in 1959, failure to keep laboratory appointments is becoming less. Pathological examinations may still be necessary even when the baby is born and the laboratory carries out any necessary tests required during the post-natal period and upon babies who do not appear to thrive satisfactorily. Laboratory tests are imperative - even if they prove negative because these form a pattern of normality and thus alleviate anxiety on the medical officer's part and even more important, on that of the parents. As regards epidemics in the Borough, the pathological laboratory again helped us and greatly due to their efforts, many such have been "nipped in the bud" In 1960, 1 am happy to state there were only 22 sporadic cases of dysentery as compared with 47 in the previous year.

Two members of your nursing staff are seconded to this clinic to assist at clinic sessions and home visiting. MASS X-RAY SERVICE Early in 1960, the Borough was visited by a unit of the Mass Miniature Radiography Service and the following is a summary of the statistics kindly provided by the Unit:- I.

Page 16 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES This section deals with those services which come under the control of the Barking Health Area Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the Essex County Council. CLINIC PREMISES Health Services Clinic - Thames View Estate The Thames View Estate Clinic was opened on the 16th March, 1960, and below is given an extract of the report given by the Architect:- "The building provides accommodation for infant welfare, minor ailments clinics, dental surgery and a chiropodist, and provision has been made for an extension at a later date. The building is of single storey construction in brick with a timber flat roof, and the majority of the windows are of metal except those in the waiting room which are in hardwood, polished The whole building has been designed with a view to reducing maintenance costs but at the same time providing pleasant and comfortable conditions for persons using the clinic." With the opening of the clinic, arrangements were made for the Thames View Group Practice of family doctors to transfer from the temp rary building erected by the Barking Borough Council to the new clinic at an agreed rental. The amen ties of the clinic are much appreciated by the publie and the members of staff who work there. CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN Maternity seRvice Ante-Natal Cure. This was given as follows:- Clinics 767 Hospitals (excluding Barking Hospital) 123 General Practitioners 112 Total 1002 Page 17 Confinements. During the year 1006 mothers were confined, giving birth to 1016 infants (including 10 sets of twins). These were born as follows:- Barking Hospital 578 Other Hospitals 126 At home 310 At Private Nursing Homes 2 Total 1016 In four instances, patients failed to seek ante-natal care, the reason being that the expected babies were illegitimate.

VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION Smallpox Vaccination During the year primary vaccination was carried out for 87 children under the age of one year and for 58 children aged between one and two years. Less than 10% of the babies under the age of one year were vaccinated. Poliomyelitis Vaccination Early in 1960 the Ministry of Health extended the Poliomyelitis Vaccination Scheme to include all persons under 40 years of age The total vaccinations carried out by family doctors and at clinics during the year was as follows:- Age Groups Born 1943 - 1960 (1 to 17 years of age) 1,102 Born 1933 - 1942 (18 to 26 years of age) 521 Born before 1933 not yet 40 years (17 to under 40 years of age) 2,840 Others (over 40 years in Priority Groups) 128 Total 4,591 Boosters (All Groups) 6,215 Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation The number of children receiving primary courses of immunisation during the year was as follows:- DIPHTHERIA Family Doctors Clinics Total Separate 348 659 1007 Combined with whooping cough 209 - 209 Total Diphtheria 557 659 1216 Page 20 WHOOPING COUGH Family Doctors Clinics Total Separate 155 545 700 Combined with diphtheria 209 - 209 Total whooping cough 364 545 909 PREVENTION OF ILLNESS, CARE AND AFTER-CARE Chiropody Service This remains a popular service and during the year 17,769 attendances were made. Chiropodists practise at Central, Woodward, Porters Avenue, Greatfields and Thames View Clinics. Sick Room Equipment This continues to be much in demand and helps greatly to assist the nursing of patients at home. At the end of the year 929 articles were out on loan. With the co-operation of the County Medical Officer, hydraulic hoists have now been supplied through the County Welfare department to a number of severely handicapped people. These appliances are much appreciated and do much to lighten the burof those who care for these unfortunate people in their homes DOMESTIC HELP SERVICE Page 21 The following table shows the number of hours of service given during the past ten years together with a detailed analy- sis of how the hours of service were deployed in 1960:- Year Number of Helps Employed Number of Cases Helped Total Hours Worked 1951 49 327 70,611 1952 84 318 85,743 1953 89 384 105,121 1954 89 503 101,960 1955 90 556 105,104 1956 93 596 104,863 1957 93 581 97,536 1958 97 550 103,787 1959 96 625 114,227 1960 110 672 122,026 The maintenance of a sufficient and suitable panel of domestic helps to meet demands presents some difficulty because the service has to compete with the attractive conditions offered by a wide range of industries, etc., in the area which employ large numbers of women. The following table shows the help given to various categories during 1960:- Cases Helped I960 Hours of Service 1960 Maternity 40 2,598 Acute Sick 18 1,636 Tuberculosis 17 4,483 Chronic Sick 91 23,760 Aged Chronic Sick 384 67,166 Aged 112 20,530 Others 10 1,853 672 122,026 Page 22 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE 1960 The information in this Section is given in my capacity as Divisional School Medical Officer of the Essex County Council. MEDICAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT The Statistical Return at the end of this report shows the classification of defects found and the treatment thereof. Minor Ailment Clinics Attendances at these clinics were well maintained during the year. CASES TREATED AT MINOR AILMENT CENTRES EYES: (External and other - excluding errors of refraction and squint) 409 EARS, NOSE AND THROAT DEFECTS: (Other than operative) 580 SKIN: Ringworm (body) 4 Scabies - Impetigo 88 Other 2,493 Other minor ailments (e.g. minor injuries, bruises, sores, chilblains, etc.) 1,600 Total attendances 20,281 Speech Therapy During the year school children made 2,116 attendances to the speech clinics. During term time the Speech Therapists continue to give four sessions per week at Faircross School. DENTAL SERVICES Statistics relating to the dental inspection and treatment of school children will be found in the statistical return at the end this report. The work of this vital service was again seriously hampered by the lack of dental officers. The Dental Laboratory continues to construct dentures and appliances not only for Barking but for many dental centres where in the County. Page 23 VACCINATION AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS This procedure, known to everyone now as B.C.G. vaccination, introduced in Barking in 1954, has now become an integral part of the School Medical Service. The response by the parents in this area has remained consistently good and we are pleased to report that our acceptance rate in Barking is one of the highest in the County. All the doctors in your service are qualified to carry out this school service and our results show a valuable adjunct tn preventive medicine. The splendid co-operation with the Chest Clinic for consultation in doubtful cases and subsequent follow-up when necessary has greatly added to our feeling of a job well done. During the current year B.C.G. vaccination was again offered to all 13 year old children and any others over that age who had not previously availed themselves of our offer. Below are statistics relating to this service:- Number to whom offered 1,607 Number tuberculin tested after parents' consent had been received 1,215 Positive result 88 Negative result 1,127 Number who received B.C.G. 1,127 Students of the South-East Essex Technical College were again invited to participate although only 31 accepted. Of this number 6 had positive reactions and the remaining 25 received B.C.G. It is of interest to note that the clinical trials conducted b1 the Medical Research Council during the past ten years into the efficacy of B.C.G. vaccination were concluded in 1960. These trials started in 1950 when several hundred senior Barking school children were included with many other children drawn from other areas in the scheme as volunteers. Throughout the succeeding ten years their health has been closely watched by the staff of the Medical Research Council, often with considerable Page 24 difficulty because in ten years many changes of address and occupation, e.g., entrance to the Armed Forces, marriage, etc., have taken place. Dr.T.M. Pollock, the present Director of the team has announced the satisfactory conclusion of the trials and stresses real benefit afforded by this vaccination. SPECIALIST SERVICES Eye Clinics Dr.R.F.Jamieson,M.B.,Ch.B.,D.O.M.S., continues to attend Central, Porters Avenue and Woodward Clinics. Appointments are made as far as possible to suit patients and parents. Cases dealt with were as follows:- External and other diseases excluding errors of refraction and squint 61 Errors of refraction (including squint) 1,126 Total 1,187 The number of pupils for whom spectacles were prescribed was 872. Miss Lewis, Orthoptist, treated 151 school children during I960. Vision Testing In my Annual Report last year, I mentioned that we had planned trials to ascertain a reliable method of assessing vision in infant school entrants. The results of this work were published in the "Medical Officer" of 9th December, 1960. This article was ''Printed in full in the 1960 Annual Report of the Principal School Medical Officer, Essex County Council. Very briefly, the vision of all infant school entrants in one term was checked by two methods. One method was carried out by school nurses in the usual way;the other method was carried out by the infant school head teachers after careful explanations and instructions as to its use. I must add here that the co-operation and willing help given by these teachers was most gratifying and Page 25 quite invaluable to our piece of research. 468 children were screened in this way, and it was found that the Sjogren Hand Test which we had hoped to use and which was readily accepted and understood by very young children, was not an entirely reliable method of assessing vision in infant schools. The E-Test appeared to be a better method and for the time being we are using this. We are, however, still pursuing investigations with a view to amending the Sjogren Hand Test so that it can be used once more as we find that very young children seem to grasp more quickly what is expected of them. Sibling Visions At the same time as the above work was in progress, we have been carrying out investigations into the incidence of vision defect in certain families. In the days before 1948 when almost annual school medical inspections were carried out, there was no problem of this nature, but nowadays when only three medical inspections are carried out during a child's school life, several years may pass before a vision defect is recognised. It has long been thought that certain families have a tendency to vision defect, and for this reason we have been following up the visions of all brothers and sisters of children found to have abnormal vision at school inspectio and comparing the number of unrecognised visual defects found in this group with that of the brothers and sisters of a group of children with normal vision. Paediatric Clinic A Consultant Paediatrician, Dr. T. Savage of the Regional Hospital Board holds a session each fortnight at the Upney Clinic and during 1960 school children were seen as follows:- New cases 93 Re-examination 175 Total Attendances 268 Ear, Nose and Throat Clinics Miss M. Mason, F.R.C.S., continues as the Consultant Ear. Nose and Throat Specialist. Figures for treatment are:Page 26 Operative treatment (cases):- (a) For diseases of the ear 1 (b) For adenoids and chronic tonsillitis 127 (c) For other nose and throat conditions 33 Other forms of treatment (cases) 205 Skin Clinic Dr. P.M..Deville, M.R.C.P.,M.R.C.S., Consultant Dermatologist, attends the Skin Clinic at Upney Clinic twice a month, and during the year 916 attendances were made to his clinic where a variety of skin conditions were dealt with, including some cosmetic blemishes. As a subsidiary of this Clinic, a "wart" clinic is also held and in conjunction with periodic foot inspections in schools, we are pleased to note that the incidence of fungus infections of the feet, though not entirely eradicated, have definitely been kept down to a reasonable level. Child Guidance The number of cases referred to the Child Guidance Clinic was 40. As in the past, co-operation with this clinic has been excellent. Although we are sorry the waiting list for new patients is still much too long, we feel this clinic provides an excellent service and only wish its work could be extended by increased staff. Orthopaedic Clinic Mr. Leon Gillis, M.B.E., F.R.C.S., continued as Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon and attended fortnightly at the Barking Hospital until his serious illness towards the end of 1960. From October onwards Mr..Whitchurch Howell, F.R.C.S., acted as locum. The number of school children referred to Mr. Gillis or Mr. Whitchurch Howell during the year was 53. HANDICAPPED PUPILS I summary is given below of the ascertainment and placement of handicapped pupils during the year:- Page 27 Category No. of pupils ascertained during 1960 No. of Pupils admitted to Special Schools during year Total No. of pupils in Special Schools as at 31.12.60 Day Residential Day Residential Deaf - - - 4 2 Partially deaf - - - 3 - Blind - - - - 4 Partially sighted 1 . . 2 - Epileptic - - - . - Delicate 6 3 2 10 5 Physically Handicapped 3 3 - 17 2 Educationally Sub-Normal 8 6 3 41 4 Maladjusted 3 - 2 . 111 Speech - - - - - Dual defect (E.S.N. & P.H.) - 1 - 1 - Totals 21 13 7 78 28 FAIRCROSS SCHOOL At the end of 1960, there was a total of 167 children attend! Faircross School. This school is divided into three sections, 0[ Air, Physically Handicapped and Educationally Sub-Normal, and the children are admitted from Dagenham, East Ham, Ilford and Romford, as well as from Barking. The following table shows the distribution:- Open-Air (Delicate) Physically Handicapped Educationally Sub-Normal Barking 9 19 41 Dagenham 14 - 7 East Ham 13 3 - Ilford - - 37 Romford 11 5 8 It will be seen from the above that some districts possess their own Special School, e.g. Dagenham has a Physically Handicapped School which does not admit delicate children, and it also has an E.S.N. School from which we take an overflow; East Ham has an E.S.N. School and Ilford has a Physically Handier ped School which admits delicate children. Page 28 The Physically Handicapped and Open-Air Sections are taught together in one part of the school and the Educationally Sub-Normal in a different part. At the time of writing this report there is virtually no waiting list for admission. E.S.N. Section During the year 11 children left the E.S.N. Section on ceasing to be of compulsory school age (3 Barking and 8 out of dis trict) - all were recommended as requiring care or guidance after leaving school. Three children (1 Barking and 2 out of district) were found to be unsuitable for education at school and recommended for action in accordance with Section 57 of the Education Act, 1944. Two Barking children were transferred to Residential Special Schools for E.S.N, pupils. Open Air Section During the year 18 delicate and 4 physically handicapped children were admitted from Barking and the surrounding districts. The following table shows the number of children in attendance on the 31 st December, 1960, together with the medical condition for which they were admitted.

In addition, 3 children (1 Barking and 2 out-ofdistrict) were transferred to Residential Open-Air Schools. 7 children (1 Barking and 6 out-of-district) left this Section on reaching the age of sixteen years. General The following information is given in respect of Faircross School and is in amplification of the mainly statistical information given in the preceeding paragraphs:- Meals are served in two sittings. The Physically Handicapped and Delicate children first and then the Educationally Sub-Normal children, while the former have their rest-time. The rest-time consists of lying down on beds or sitting in deck-chairs and relaxing with a book or toy. The Nursery-class children are fed separately because they require training and they are cared for by one of the two Nurse Attendants. Nurse Attendants. These two ladies are experienced in first aid and have a sufficient knowledge to enable them to administer medicines, tablets, ointments or whatever is ordered by the medical staff. They are most helpful and very kindly to the children and they arrive at 9 a.m. as to be available as soon as the first children arrive. Malt and Iron is given daily to the Open-Air and Physically Handicapped children and, when recommended, to the Educationally Sub-Normal children. Milk is allowed in the usual way except that the Open-Air children are entitled to two bottles daily. Page 30 Physiotherapy. It is a source of grave concern and disappointment to us that we have been unable to replace our last Physiotherapist who left in May 1960. Every possible avenue has been explored, but it seems that all Hospital and Orthopaedic Clinics are having equal difficulty in finding applicants for such positions. For this reason we cannot ask the help of our own Orthopaedic Clinic at Barking Hospital; nor even, in many cases, can we refer the children for treatment in their own area as their areas are in the same difficulty. It is a problem which appears at first sight to have no hope of solution unless Physiotherapists are graded differently and their remuneration increased to make it commensurate with the essential nature of their work. Recently however we have been informed that the number of student Physiotherapists has increased by 35% since 1957 and we are hoping the benefits of the increase will be felt in the near future. The following table shows the number of children receiving group or individual treatment at the beginning of 1960. Group Breathing Exercises (Twice a week) 18 Group Breathing Exercises and daily postural drainage 6 Individual treatment (Daily or at least twice a week) 14 Medical Inspections are held at the school each Wednesday morning and parents are invited to attend by appointment. It is pleasing to be able to report that there is an extremely happy relationship between medical and teaching staff and each case is discussed individually from all aspects. Miss Storm, the Headmistress, has a wonderful understanding of these children and is of the greatest help to us. The Educationally Sub-Normal children are seen at a School Medical Inspection once a year and the Open-Air and Physically Handicapped children are seen as nearly as possible each term. In addition, children are also seen at the request of the Head Teacher as the teaching staff are encouraged to bring forward any cases where they feel there may be some health problem which is not entirely satisfactory. Accommodation is quite inadequate at the moment for all these medical services, but we are hoping that a small medical suite will eventually be allowed us so that our services may be run more satisfactorily. Speech Therapy. There is a Speech Therapist who attends two full days a week and whose work is most useful and indeed essential. It must be realised how difficult it is to succeed in improving speech when children are backward spastic, and infinite patience is required. Mrs. Houldgraves who has been with us since April 1959 is a capable, kindly and understanding Speech Therapist and we are very fortunate to have the benefit of her services. During 1960, Twenty-four children were receiving weekly treatment or under observation by her. Return to Ordinary School. It is rare for children once recommended for admission as Educationally Sub-Normal to return to an ordinary school, for the simple reason that we avoid admission to Faircross unless it is quite obvious that their ability to learn is too seriously impaired to allow any hope of improvement in an ordinary school. Conversely, some of the Children who might strictly speaking be classed as ineducable are retained at Faircross even if there is only a modicum of achievement in Page 31 school, whether social or educational. In the case of Physically Handicapped children we always try to leave in an ordinary school children whose disability is not serious enough to constitute a real obstacle to normal life or work in school. Thus if they need to be admitted to Faircross School, they are usually severely handicapped. Some, but not many, may eventually return to ordinary school. In the same way, children recommended for admission to the OpenAir Section are in a sufficiently poor state of health that their school attendance and, in consequence, their scholastic achievement is seriously impaired. Contrary to the Physically Handicapped group, however, many of these improve in health sufficiently to allow a transfer back to an ordinary school. Transport. School starts at 9.30 a.m. for the Open-Air and Physically Handicapped, and 10 a.m. for the Educationally Sub-Normal children. It breaks up at 3.45 p.m. Ten coaches bring the children to school each morning from their various districts. Only a few children have special bus passes or walk at their parents' request if it is deemed wise to allow them this independence, or perhaps because they live quite near. Swimming. The children are particularly fortunate in being allowed the use of the South-East Essex County Technical School swimming bath once a week all the year round. They are eligible to apply for this from the age of eleven years onwards and it is of great benefit to them as well as a source of much fun and happiness. During the summer months they are also allowed the use of Barking Baths once a week. School leaving age. This is sixteen in all Sections of the School, but in the case of many physically handicapped and open-air children they may be released at fifteen if it is deemed advisable from a medical, social or educational standpoint. Before leaving school every effort is made to establish co-operative action and thought between Head Teacher, parent, child and Youth Employment Officer so that suitable employment may be found. OTHER SPECIAL SCHOOLS During the year fifty-eight Barking children attended other special schools or received home tuition as follows:- Category Day Residential Home Tuition Blind - 4 - Partially Sighted 2 1 - Deaf 5 3 - Partially Deaf 5 - - Physically Handicapped 3 4 1 Delicate - 10 1 Diabetic - 1 - Page 32 Category Day Residential Home Tuition Epileptic - - - Educationally Sub-Normal - 4 1 Maladjusted - 12 1 CONVALESCENCE Ninety-two children were sent away for periods of convalescence of up to 6 weeks.

This is an average of 229 per annum. A similar number will be necessary for the next fifteen years to provide for redevelopment and overcrowding. With every available piece of land in the Borough accounted for, it would seem inevitable for our central area densities to be increased. The Council has already planned for such a redevelopment which, together with the clearance of a further 2,200 dwellings in the 75 acres of the Gascoigne area, will mean the ultimate rebuilding of what once constituted the old Barking Town area. The houses to be cleared are small four room type dwellings in the main, now obsolescent and defective. They are near and on the fringe of the heart of the town, and their replacement will provide a challenge to the planners and architects. The economics of this can arouse dismay but at the same time provide the Council with the interesting problem of rebuilding to a new design. Much slum clearance will be necessary in addition to what has already been accomplished. The future children of Barking will judge us not in terms of finance, nor of administration, but only in terms of what we build. We must not bequeath a dreary architectural legacy to posterity. THAMES VIEW ESTATE "Finis" was written to the creation of this small new town of 2,112 dwellings constructed by the Council on a low-lying site regarded for many years as unsuitable for building, and resisted by the planners for several years. Page 40 The Council on this estate has provided homes for displaced residents in clearance areas, in addition to homes for the newly married and the aged. The clinics, schools, shops, public houses, community centre, etc., have provided the ancilary services which complete the requirements and make the estate a community. It is an achievement for which the Council is fully entitled to take pride and credit. CLEARANCE AREAS The Council's scheme for the redevelopment of the Gascoigne area took a leap forward with the confirmation order for the compulsory purchase of the 222 properties in the Clearance Area known as Gascoigne Road(Area No.l). The public enquiry occupied two days and aroused much interest in the Borough. The following extract from the official representation is given because not only does the description apply to the houses within This first clearance area, but in the main it is true of the 2,200 houses in the 75 acres of the Gascoigne area in which redevelop- ment is proposed. "The area is well known because of its dreary surroundings, its mean streets, its general squalor of the back yards and rear access paths or alley- ways. The houses were built in the main between 1893 and 1901. They are not all old nor are all serious disrepair. They are badly arranged on the site, badly arranged internally, inadequate by modern standards for family life and unfit for human habitation because of certain principal defects. They are uncomfortable to live in. Both occupiers and owners must constantly fight a losing battle against disrepair. The whole picture of the area is one in which occupiers and owner occupiers in particular have themselves strenuously attempted, by adding temporary and unsatisfactory structures, to make a home fit for occupation, but failed to do so. Of the 222 premises in the area there are 103 with ugly temporary back addition structures which have enclosed the W.C.apartment, drains and sinkwaste gully. The rooms so constructed have become principal rooms where food is prepared and eaten, insanitary, badly lighted and ventilated, and obstructive to the natural lighting and ventilation of the remaining ground floor rooms. In consequence there is the dampness of condensation added to patches of rising dampness with generally excessive humidity in the occupied rooms. Further discomfort is caused by the absence of an entrance passage from the street. This defect with the inadequate size of the rooms converts the ground Page 41 floor rooms into a draughty corridor. The secondary approach to the rear of the dwellings is along narrow unpaved, unlighted alleys, through pools of water in bad weather. This rear access must be used for all the dirty work such as removal of refuse, delivery of coal or coke and family bicycle traffic as the planning of the house prevents any such traffic through the dwelling. Because of the long terrace type of site-planning there is a long carry for both the collection of refuse and delivery of fuel in excess of accepted standards. The fire hazard from the temporary wooden structures cannot be disregarded. The entrance to the staircase is in the living room so that waste from the bedrooms must be transported through the living room. Such practice is prejudicial to health, especially in times of sickness. The dwellings in Abbey Road, Bifrons Street, Howard Road and Morley Road with brick built single-storey back additions appear to have been erected prior to 1900. Such damp courses as were provided have perished and there is considerable rising dampness in main walls. The sculleries (and larders where they exist) are damp and insanitary. Staircases and W.C.'s are badly lighted and ventilated. In many instances back addition buildings have settled and brickwork is in disrepair. Rear access is from unpaved alleys as before. In the main building the standard of decoration is fair, but walls where dampness is masked are stained and uneven. Wood floors and stair-treads are worn, uneven, defective and show signs of settlement. Joinery is generally damaged and illfitting. The internal arrangement of the house is bad. There is no entrance passage from the street, the staircase rises between the living rooms and is dark and dangerous. The W.C. apartment is situated externally - often unscreened from neighbours. Rear and division fences are missing or dilapidated. Front boundary walls and gates are similar in condition." CLEARANCE AREAS During the year under.review the Council declared as unfit dwellings the following:- Premises Families King Edward's Road (No.l) 14 Clearance Area 1960 11 Section C - FOOD SUPPLIES FOOD PREMISES The following is a list of the various premises in the Borough used for the storage and sale of food:- Page 42 Bakehouses 3 Bread and Cake Shops 22 Butchers Shops 42 Confectionery Shops 81 Factory Canteens 53 Fishmongers and Fish Fryers 22 Fruiterers and Greengrocers 43 Grocery Shops 96 Ice Cream Manufacturers 2 Ice Cream Vendors 147(Inc. 48 Itinerant) Milk Shops 47 Public Houses & Off Licensed Premises 32 Public House Restaurants 10 Cafes 47 Shops in Markets 50 School Meal Centres and Kitchens 41 Street Traders 14 Mobile Traders 37 Chemists 19 Warehouses and Factories 15 INSPECTION OF FOOD PREMISES Food Hygiene Regulations Further improvement in the standard of food handling premises has been achieved, particularly regarding provision of equipment and facilities. On 1st October the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960 came into force. These re-enacted the Regulations of 1955 making certain amendments and adding extra powers where it has proved necessary. During the year the following inspections were made and notices served:- Number of visits made to these premises 3,514 Number of defective or dirty walls, ceilings and floors 74 Number of notices to repair or provide hot water fittings 9 Number of notices to repair counters, tables and cupboards 17 Number of notices to repair drains and yard paving 12 Number of notices to provide sinks & wash-hand basins 6 Page 43 Page 44 Number of notices to repair or renew defective sanitary fitments 22 Number of notices to prevent contamination of food Nil Number of notices to provide soap, nail brushes and towels 4 Number of notices to provide suitable and sufficient lighting 4 Number of notices to stop and prevent smoking 5 Number of notices to provide first aid equipment 1 On occasions the inspecting officers gave verbal notices to remedy minor defects where it was not considered necessary to serve written notices. Food and Drugs Sampling Regular sampling indicated the standard of foodstuffs has been maintained at a high level. Samples totalled 224 of which 66 were formal and 159 informal. Some unusual commodities were sampled including tinned chocolate covered ants and fried grasshoppers. These are of foreign manufacture and stocked in small quantities by one retailer. The Public Analyst's results were satisfactory. A series of samples was purchased during an investigation of a complaint concerning verbal advertisement by a fishmonger that his potato chips were starch reduced during cooking. The results showed this to be untrue and a verbal warning was given to the fishmonger who has now ceased the practice.

The main change in the Borough was the issued licences to 47 dealers enabling them to sell milk with a special designation. These licences last five years and include the automatic vending machines situated in Movers Lane and Tanner Street. No raw milk is sold in the Borough. During the year 87 samples were taken from roundsmen, shops and schools and all were found satisfactory.

One manufacturer was registered in December but did not commence operation. Some trouble was experienced with samples taken within the Borough of a product manufactured elsewhere. All possible action was taken during the year. The retailer has changed his manufacturer with successful results. During the year 120 samples of ice cream were submitted to the Methylene Blue examination.

This Order relates to an area of 428 acres which includes 4,622 dwellings, 2036 of which are owned by the Barking Council and 1756 by the London County Council. As a result of a survey of every house in the area carried out mainly by post, it was estimated that 2,608 open fires would need to be replaced by approved coke burning grates, and 1,266 would require to be equipped with facilities for lighting the fire- The total cost of the scheme was estimated to be £32,704 of which £13,082 would be borne by the National Exchequer, £9,811 by the Barking Council and £9,811 by the owners or occu piers of the dwellings. It is anticipated that the adaptations of grates will be car ried out during 1961 and that the Order will become operative on 1st January, 1962. Thames View Estate - 2,112 Dwellings No difficulty in the supply of smokeless fuel was experienced on the estate, which is in a smoke control area by reason of tenancy agreements. It would appear that tenants are satisfied 55 with smokeless fuel burned on approved appliances and have no complaints of fume emission. Co-operation with other Authorities The Council continued to co-operate with other Local Authorities in dealing with air pollution problems. If any progress is to be made in this field, it seems essential that any local activities should form part of a wider scheme. The Council is represented at the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies for Atmospheric Pollution, of which your Chief Public Health Inspector is Chairman. This is a conference of all the authorities and organisations which join with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in the measurement of solid and gaseous pollution of the air. Two meetings of another conference took place during the year. This was a conference of neighbouring Local Authorities and provided an opportunity for discussing common problems arising from the implementation of the Clean Air Act. Representatives of fuel suppliers were present at the meetings so that questions of delivery delays could be dealt with expeditiously. Industrial Smoke The work to reduce the smoke emitted from industrial premises has continued with some success.. Seven notifications were received during the year of new furnace installations, all of which were to be oil fired. Whilst this trend may reduce the amount of smoke and grit discharged into the atmosphere, it does nothing to reduce the Pollution by sulphur oxides and sulphuric acid. At the present stage of scientific knowledge it is not practicable to remove sulphur compounds from solid or liquid fuels or economically to rewove them from flue gases. It is essential therefore to ensure that with every fuel burning installation there is a chimney to disperse flue gases at a sufficient height to prevent dangerous concentrations at ground level. By virtue of Section 10 of the Clean Air Act, the Local Authority have power to control the height of any chimney 56 included in an application for Town Planning approval. In many designs for modern buildings there is a tendency to disguise the chimneys in an attempt to ensure that it is not seen. However admirable this may be from an aesthetic point of view, from a public health standpoint it would be better to have the chimney discharging well above and clear of surrounding buildings. There can be no doubt however that the removal of smoke and grit particles from the atmosphere will do much to alleviate the suffering of those affected with respiratory and cardiac disorders. Although sulphur gases may be present, their harmful effects appear to be reduced when smoke is removed. Smoke Observations Regular observations have been carried out to check emissions from industrial chimneys. As will be seen from the Table, the number of contraventions is not large. The contraventions an usually from installations consuming waste wood and are due generally to the changing nature of the wood waste being fed to the furnaces. Some woods burn easily whilst others are extremely difficu It and only vigilance on the part of the boiler room attendant can ensure a proper mixture and can prevent smoke pollution. Measurement of Pollution - Volumetric During the year, this new type of measuring apparatus was brought into use. In this apparatus the air is drawn from outside by a pump and passed through a filter paper. The smoke particles are removed in the filter and the air is then passed through a solution of hydrogen peroxide to remove the sulphur gas. It is possible thus to determine the weight of smoke and sulphur dioxide per unit volume of air. The apparatus is essentially designed to measure pollution arising from domestic sources and has been sited at Eastbury House, which is in the centre of Smoke Control (No.D Area.It will therefore be possible to check the efficacy of the domestic smoke control measures in this area. The graphs on Pages 58-62 indicate clearly how much 57 pollution of the air arises from the domestic chimney and emphasises the need for domestic smoke control. Deposit Gauges Measurement of heavier pollution such as grit and dust by using the deposit gauges was continued at Barking Park, Greatfields Park, Parsloes Park and Thames View Estate. The graph on Page 62 shows the variation in the pollution from month to month. This difference does not necessarily reflect a comparable difference in grit and dust discharged to the air although it is bound to be somewhat less in the summer than in the winter. Climatic conditions however have an effect on the amount of grit and dust which falls to the ground. On warr clear days upward air currents would tend to carry pollution to the upper atmosphere and so bring about greater dispersion than occurs in the winter when pollution is brought down by tain and lack of upward air currents.

In accordance with a hire scheme complementary to the above mentioned 135 properties were supplied with dustbins. In each of these cases the dustbin will be paid for by seven annual payments of four shillings and sixpence. The total number of properties in the instalment scheme for the provision of dustbins is 1,000. The total number of privately owned premises in the Borough now supplied with standard type of dustbin has reached 7,004. Public Cleansing - Refuse Disposal The Borough Engineer and Surveyor has supplied me with the following information:- The quantity of refuse collected and disposed of throughout the year was 93,741 cubic yards, the average weight 4.24 cwts. per cubic yard and the total weight was 20,080 tons. OFFENSIVE TRADES Throughout the year there have been twenty-six visits to the eight offensive trade premises in the Borough. Type of Trade Number Oil Boilers 6 Gut Scrapers 20 Oil Boilers There are three groups of products where oil boiling is Part of the process of manufacture:- 65 1. Paint 2. Printers' Ink 3. Stand oil lithographic varnish. The change in production methods, all now using new materials and techniques, have resulted in operations practically free from noxious fumes. Fat Melting and Gut Cleaning The only premises in the Borough remaining in use has been established as an offensive trade for over 50 years.. Both industrial and residential development in its vicinity has meant more complaints. Whilst the operations are controlled by byelaws, the problem of suitable labour to carry out the work is a constant hazard. To further reduce the risk of noxious fume emission improved mechanical extraction equipment is being installed but ultimately a new site must be found. Disinfestation of Verminous Premises During the year we received complaints from 32 premises of vermin infestation-bed bugs. The total premises comprised:- Barking Council Houses 16 London County Council Houses 12 Privately owned 4 32 The Council provide free a supply of insecticide for domestic use and carry out fumigation where circumstances require it. Flies, Cockroaches, etc. We have continued to operate a mobile spraying unit using spersable gammexane chiefly for dealing with breeding sites at offensive trade premises, stables, open land, tips, piggeries and stagnat water courses. 66 We are satisfied that this practice is successful as a preventive mea sure. There were 127 premises treated. Pet Animals Act 1951 During the year 18 inspections were made of the eight licensed premises in the Borough. All are small shops with the usual facilities available and with care for the weekend period. In the case of an outdoor market stall special arrangements are necessary to cover the period when the market is closed.
