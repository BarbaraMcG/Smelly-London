Sou 3 No. 9 Parish of Saint George the Martyr Southwark. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the First Quarter, 1858. . April 16th, 1858. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Vestry, I have now to present you with the report for the quarter ending April 3rd ; it comprises abstracts of matter brought before you in the eight individual reports presented during the quarter, and the usual Tables. The first Table shews an absolute increase of deaths as compared with those of the corresponding quarters of 1856 and 1857; but when the average number of deaths is considered, and the proper addition made for increase of population, 1 find 73 deaths less than the average : the rate of increase of population, as shewn by the census, is 592 upon the average, each year : during nine of the last thirteen years the deaths were many more for the quarter than in this now ended, although the population averaged three or four thousand less. We may then fairly conclude that the public health is improving. Thirty-five aged persons have died during the quarter, sixteen from 70 to 80—sixteen from 80 to 90—three from 92 to 97—eight were males and twenty-seven females—twenty-nine of the thirtyfive were persons living in the poorest districts of the parish, and twenty-four out of the twenty-seven women were widows. Nine infants, not all however actually destroyed during the quarter, met their deaths under suspicious circumstances—the most of them were suffocated ; one aged person died from want, and one from suicide. In the second Table, as compared with the corresponding one in last report, you will observe that out of the eight parishes noted, six, including ours, show a more or less decreased mortality, and two only a slight increase. The state of health is however about the same, as that quarter consisted of fourteen weeks and this of thirteen. Diarrhoea diminished from twelve to two, and fever from nine to six. No fever or smallpox cases were sent to the Fever Hospital. 3369 "casuals" were relieved at the Workhouse. The men sleep below ground in a space intended for eleven, the women and children above ground in a spaoe intended for fourteen; frequently they contain very many more; an early morning visitor would perceive by the occasional stench of these underground rooms, that for health's sake as well as humanity, some great change in the mode of treating and of supporting this class of persons is required—they come from all quarters and usually to the poorest parishes. The third Table shows an increase of zymotic disease as compared with the quarter last year; •his has arisen from measles, scarlatina, croop and hooping cough; while diarrhoea and fever, which are Bore our tests of a bad or good sanitary condition, have shown a great decrease. The temperature of the Bid-quarter was very low, the coldest February and half March for forty years; this accounts for the increased deaths from hooping cough, and for no small portion of the 128 deaths from chest diseases. A more attentive and common sense regard to the weather,(which in this climate is often so very changeable and trying,) and the consequent judicious exposure or protection of tender-chested persons, and children with hooping cough, would save a very large number. Hooping cough (except in previously diseased children) is with fair management by no means a destroying complaint, but the majority of children so circumstanced would do far better with good common domestic care, than with the nostrums with which They are so often teased, and I believe destroyed. The wind was S.W. and Westerly at first; it has ever since been Northerly, Easterly or changeable. The rain-fall was about one-third less than the average. The fourth Table shows 103 deaths in the Kent Road district, or one in 186 of the population. 108 „ London Road „ 175 „ 127 ,, Borough Road „ 132 „ last, however, comprises the Workhouse, and consequently a few cases from the other districts. It also gives the particulars of 1472 cases of illness among the poor, and of 1019 attended at the Royal South London Dispensary. The amount of sickness among the poor remains much as it was ; about forty less, Perhaps, under constant care. I have as usual to acknowledge the courtesy of the medical officers of the respective institutions in the parish for the returns here recorded. No death, and only two cases from small Pox, are recorded; nor were there any deaths in the corresponding quarter. I know not for certain ether vaccination is or is not attended to fairly in this parish ; the parish surgeons vaccinate about four times the number of children born of paupers; the total births for the quarter were 540, the total Vaccinations performed by the appointed officers, 207. No doubt a large number are vaccinated by pate surgeons and at institutions, but very many children beyond the proper age are found unvaccinated. there are some who this great precaution, and so not only imperil themselves but others ; here is the vevil and indeed 1 believe the reason why the disease is not altogether banished; the records show a great decrease in deaths from this disease in London, 41 this quarter; the corresponding quarter of 1857, 1 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. 60; of 1856,194; of 1855,323; and thus is fore.shadowed the entire suppression of this disease. In a recent visit I traced out a few cases, a fair specimen of the way it usually appears in a neighbourhood; I must premise that this now under notice is one of our bad spots. In Northampton Court a man had it very severely, but recovered ; he came from a house in the country where a young man died of this disease, and so imported it; I have reason to believe that neither had been vaccinated. A neighbour's two children who had been vaccinated now took it, but very slightly—only a few spots appeared ; then it attacked another neighbour's family, selecting a filthy house with almost every known sanitary defect, and people without any idea of cleanliness; passing over two children who had been vaccinated, it attacked all the others who had not been so protected; they have had severe preliminary fever and severe small pox; one is since dead. Scarlet fever, from which there have been 10 deaths and 38 cases recorded, appeared in one of the worst spots in the parish in January; the week following another case and a death in the same street; then in one of our closest courts. It appeared in successive weeks in Belvidere.buildings, Gray.street, Tower.street, and Lee's.place; now for the first time it spread to clean and well.ordered places. A case registered as dyptheria occurred and died ; the sister a few days after was attacked with scarlatina maligna and died, no doubt affected by this previous case registered as dyptheria; then a child opposite also died. So in the Kent.road district, it began in one of the very worst localities in the circle of Potier.street, Little Hunter.place and Rephidon.street, and then extended to opener and better places. Thus it is that modern society neglects the social condition of its poor, and the poor with a well.ordered revenge bring disease and death as the consequence. In the healthier parts of our parish, there have also been many cases of sore.throat remotely simulating dyptheria and other affections of the tonsils and throat, and which have been generally readily cured. Last year most of the cases now called dyptheria would no doubt have been called sore.throat, cynanche, and the like: several such have been noticed in Bethlem Hospital. Among the diseases related to me and worth further notice was one at Bethlem, a case of purpura (a low state of health with livid or blood.coloured spots on the skin allied to sea scurvy) in a man who from antipathy avoided vegetable diet; Dr. Helps said, probably from that cause; the case was readily cured by supplying the deficiency in the usual manner. In the sixthTable, which shows the particulars of every death, in disease, age and sex; I introduce for the first time the number for the coiresponding quarter last year; you may thus see the varying severity of every individual disease, quarter by quarter, and year by year; we shall thus note which most to guard against. It is here shown that 174 out of 338 died under 10 years of age; rather more than half thus early. Dr. Letheby speaks of one.third as a high rate of mortality among children ; what then must ours be which keeps rather steadily at half, or a little over. The fact is, there is in this part of London little or no provision for the out.door exercise of children, and but little inducement for parents to take them out; contrast the ricketty, pale thin forms that are always in.doors, and so fastidiously cared for, with even the ragged and filthy urchins who roll about at our feet; we shall see at once that the latter, with all their privations and ignorance, are in comparison rough and healthy, and in their way enjoy life. Among "The Friends," who appear upon the whole to be the most practically sensible people living; the children who die under 10 years of age are, not one in two as with us, but one in eight only; if we had bequeathed such healthy constitutions, and had acted as wisely afterwards by our children as " The Friends ' have, we should have lost only 42 children instead of 174. In this Table appear 42 deaths from consumption: it has but recently become prominent how very preventable a disease this is. As to the causes, no doubt it is hereditary, but it must of course be produced before it can be bequeathed; and the disease appears to be produced most generally by ignorance or disregard of the natural laws of health ; of every 100 deaths in the Guards, 67 are caused by consumption ; and these are picked lives; the principal causes have here been made obvious enough; sleeping closely in ill.ventilated rooms, over.crowding and bad ventilation, so that persons cannot without disgust enter in the morning where the sleepers are; the rooms are so offensive. I have often experienced this in my early visits among the sick poor, and in my visits as your Officer of Health, one of the most prominent complaints I hear, is the offensiveness of the houses in the morning, and the need of throwing open doors and windows " to let the smell out." The list of streets and courts where these deaths mostly occur in our parish point there to the same causes, filthy dwellings, over.crowding and an absence of that ventilation or continual sweetening process which would well nigh prevent it at all. William.street, Webber.row, Hunter.street, Clarendon.street, Surrey.street, George.street, show by far the most deaths from this disease. The births recorded, were 540, of which 289 were males, and 251 females; of the deaths, 179 were males, and 159 females; other circumstances being equal, an increase appears of 202 ; that being the excess of births over deaths for the quarter; the real annual increase as calculated is 592. The water supply appears to be as good as can be reasonably expected :*— Total Impurity.

The amount of sanitary work is exhibited in the last Table, and very much arrears are shown. It is becoming daily more and more evident that the work ordered is more often than otherwise done in a slovenly manner, so that in the "long run," expense is increased, and much unnecessary vexation both to your officers and to the parties concerned produced. Work is being done, ana yet not to any effectual purpose: I cannot help thinking that a trustworthy workman, under a responsible officer, is required to make a daily visit (and if necessary to remain.) and make daily record of every work and the manner of its performance from the time it is ordered until it is finished. We are of course very slow in emptying cesspools, only eight have been abolished during the quarter; very properly so, when the sewers are themselves ces-pools in continual motion for eight hours, and stagnant, or being stirred up, during sixteen hours, in every day. I must, however, take this opportunity of stating that the embankment of the Thames is, so far as health is concerned, in my opinion, the solution of the great problem of metropolitan drainage. Of course in the south low level, a lift would have to be established, as proposed by the surveyor of Camberwell; and this is a work that cannot be commenced too soon. I am most hnppy to see that a Royal Commission has reported for the Thames Embankn ent. Many cases, about 31, have been decided upon by the Magistrate; in some, where the work is considerable and expensive, as in the case of the bone boilers, ample time is given; but it is understood that the work ordered must be done to the satisfaction of your officers. Two cases, very urgent ones, after much trouble fell through, from the deaths of the owners and the need therefore of new proceedings: one was dismissed, inasmuch as the man's premises were, in the opini n of the magistrate, suffering instead of causing a nuisance, from the want of a public urinal near at hand. A friendly notice has been given to amend the ventilation of the Southwark Police Court, which is at times too offensive to be either pleasant or safe. Notice has been given by the inspector to the police ol many dangerous structures; the police are prompt and render us a most valuable service; without doubt serious accidents must occur in these very old perishing houses, if such precautions are not taken. I have received notice from a saniary committee at the Board of Health to use if possible an amended form of returns instead of the heading of this seventh Table. I think as the Hoard of Health desires uniformity of returns, books require to be provided in which we might regularly record them, like the books of the Poor Law Board or the broad sheets of the Registrar General; it is exceedingly difficult to make returns without, and unless the books are sent from one place, I fear there will be no uniform plan. I have taken the liberty of forwarding to each gentleman of this vestry four or five specimens of tracts published by the Manchester Sanitary Association; very valuable they are; my object in this, is, if you approve of them, to be allowed to purchase more, to be given here and there among the people we visit, haply to inform and produce a good impression. I believe it is your with that the aguregate of these quarterly reports shall constitute the annual report; 1 will therefore, with that view, append Tables with remarks, and which will require to be printed with this report—these I Tables to be in harmony with the Registrar General's reports will be for the 53 weeks enoing January 2nd, 1858.

Griffith, 5, Langley Street, Long Acre, w. c., Printers to Her Majesty's Stationery Office. St. George the Martyr, Southwark. SECOND ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VESTRY. In accordance with the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry submits the following Report for the Year ending the 25th March, 1858. It will be found to contain an Account in Abstract, showing the Receipt and Expenditure of the Vestry for the period above named ; and also a Summary Statement of all Contracts entered into, and of the monies owing to, and debts and liabilities owing by the Vestry on the above day. These Accounts have been Audited and allowed by the Auditors elected by the Parishioners ; and from them it will be seen that the Vestry had, at that date, a balance of Credit upon the General Purposes' Rate Account, amounting to £122 17s. 5d.; and on the Sewers' Rate Account, a balance of Debit, amounting to £123 8s. 11d.: thus showing a total excess on all accounts of Expenditure over Receipts for the whole Year of Ten Shillings and Sixpence. The expense of Lighting is a large item, incapable of diminution by the Vestry; and on account of some parts of the Parish having never been lit under any Commission prior to the Act which the Vestry has to carry out, this item has necessarily in this respect been augmented. The Surveyor of Roads in his Report accordingly reminds the Vestry, that "during the past Year the Vestry has had ten new Columns, and sixteen new Brackets, (making together twenty-six additional lights,) put up in some of the worst localities of the Parish." In this matter, as in all others, the Vestry has endeavoured to exercise the greatest possible economy consistent with the public advantage. During the Year the following Streets have been re-paved, viz.:—White Street (both carriage-way and foot-way,) Pitt Street, Brent's Court, York Street, Potier's Place, Foxes 4 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward, Annual Report of the Vestry. Buildings, Little Lant Street, Wickham Place, Montague Street, Suffolk Court, and Gun Street. The following have been partially re-paved, viz.:—Thomas Street, Noel Street, Lansdown Place, Mermaid Court, Harrow Street, and parts of High Street, Blackmail Street, and the Old Kent Road; besides that most of the Streets and Courts of the Parish have been more or less repaired as was found necessary. The totals are tabulated thus:— CARRIAGE-WAY New Part dressed, re-laid and grouted 329 yards superficial 1849 yards superficial FOOT-WAY New Flag Paving Flag Paving re-laid New Curb Curb dressed and re-set Curb re-set Feet superficial Feet Superficial Feet run.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In order to complete my quarterly reports; and so, according to your wish, to make them presentable as an annual report; permit me to supplement them with the necessary Tables, and some few explanatory observations. I have, during the year 1857, read 25 before you ; four of them, quarterly reports, were printed by your order. Almost all, have also appeared in the Local Journal, and have, as I know, been read by many beyond these walls and this parish. 1 hope, however feebly, I may set forth the almost numberless instances of injury coming upon society ; and especially upon the poor, from neglect of sanitary principles ; that, nevertheless, the continual appearance of practical reports, setting forth as much as in us lies, the evil and the remedy ; will not fail to produce a conviction, in the minds of all, that this work is not only necessary, but is one of the most practical forms of working out our " duty to our neighbourespecially our poor, ignorant, and more destitute neighbour : I have therefore studied to put my reports in shape as interesting as possible; and I have to acknowledge the courtesy of the gentlemen connected with our Local Journal in giving me the necessary space, and occasionally their most valued approbation. Considering the amazing strides made in our time, it seems most strange that we should now be obliged to confess ourselves on the very threshold of this knowledge upon which life and health, and the best of this world's comforts depend ; and still more strange is it, when we recollect that 3,500 years ago the Jewish legislator promulgated laws and duties, almost identical with those we are now engaged in carrying out as new in the nineteenth century ; but so it is. I beg now to request your attention to the added Tables. In the first Table, fifth col., is shown the population for 1851 of the respective parishes usually mentioned in my reports; and in small figures I have estimated the population to the middle of 1867. In some parishes the population appears to be stationary ; in others, including ours, a more or less increase is shown. You will observe, on comparing the sixth column with the sixteenth, that in the poorer parishes the excess of births over deaths is most considerable. In St. James's, seven in the 1,000 more are born than die; in Hampstead, seven ; in St. George's, twelve; in Bethnal Green, sixteen. It may be slated as a sort of rule, that where there are more deaths, there are generally more births ; the fourteenth and fifteenth columns will show this. It appears also that the rich have fewer children ; 1,000 persons, each representing 12/. 13s. 4d., in St. James's, produce annually 27 births; 1,000 persons, representing each 5/. 16s, in Hampstead, have 29 births; with us 1,000 persons, representing each 31. 6s. Ad., have 35 births, while the same number, representing each 1l. 10s., in Bethnal Green, have 40 births. Table 2 shows 393 deaths in the Kent Road district, or 20'34 in 1,000. 373 „ London „ or 19-57 „ In the Borough Road, including the workhouse, and a few cases imported there from the other districts, ■183 deaths are shown, or 28 55 in 1,000, I have often stated that the Borough Road or Mint Street district, is much more densely populated, and more fatal than the others; and have from time to time stated to you what I consider to be the causes. Some spots in all the districts are remarkably unhealthy, and to these the principal part of our sanitary attention has been given. The fourth Table will, to some extent, show which these are; it cannot at present be done perfectly, for the very worst places are often so crowded, or otherwise so unfit; that the extremely sick are removed, and the deaths are recorded else- 2 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. where, such as in hospitals or workhouses: the worst places may thus appear, so far as deaths go, the best. In the third Table, are recorded the deaths of 626 males and 623 females; that is, 22.55 in every 1,000 of our population. A very great improvement appears in the health of the South of London, more than in the other districts. The average of the previous ten years, shows 26.28 deaths per 1,000; while in this year, 1857, the mortality was 21.60; this difference of nearly five in the 1,000 represents a saving of 3,230 lives annually in the south districts of London alone. In England and Wales the proportion was 21.76; in all London, 22.20. In 1339 the deaths in this parish were 25.68 in 1,000; now, as you see by this Table, they are 22.56; if in 1857 we had lost at the same rate as the mortality of 1839 shows; I should have had to record 164 deaths more for this year than are here shown; these favourable results are worth securing, and are also worth increasing; to save annually in one parish 164 lives is indeed a great gain. The Registrar General computes, that for every death, two persons are constantly ill; 164 less deaths, would indicate 328 fewer cases of illness; each constant case would represent many actual cases of illness; how many I cannot say, but a very great number. Some not very hopeful people think, that we cannot get below a ratio of 22 deaths in the 1,000 inhabitants; but from the improvement since 1839 just cited; and from what I see of the sanitary defects easily removable, with good faith in the examination and good faith in the carrying out the work ordered; we may reasonably expect to come gradually down at least to 17 or 18 in the 1,000. We have a good substratum of gravel just below us, through which currents of water are almost constantly filtering;—add to this natural advantage impermeable house drains, a better storage of water or a constant supply, less cramming so many human heings into so small a space, (a family or more in a room); you will see at once that more improvement may come about than we can at present expect. In 1681 to 90, the annual death rate in London was 42.10 per 1,000; in 1746 to 65, it was 35.50; in 1844 to 55, it was only 24.90. Here is great improvement steadily achieved; are we now, with increased knowledge, to stop short, with so much recognised removable death-cause about us? I would also draw your attention to that part of this Table, which shows 642 deaths under 10 years old,— more than half the total deaths; 21 of them died of scarlatina; 64 of whooping cough; 69 of diarrhœa; 66 of tabes, or bowel decline; 26 of consumption, or lung decline; 96 of brain disease; and 121 of chest complaints: much of all this is preventable. I have often expatiated upon this in my reports to you; better food, but especially better air, even with the same food; would, without doubt, save numbers of these children. The mass of them have not stamina enough to stand up against the complaints that usually attack children; and which complaints would, with ordinary power to meet them, pass along over them with little real injury; and many of the diseases would (the helping cause being weakened and removed) die out. I am surprised to record but one death from small-pox; having lately seen many children growing up unvaccinated;—and now small-pox is becoming prevalent: 1,973 births are recorded for the year; the public vaccinators have returned but 680 cases successfully vaccinated; and but 731 were registered according to law: no doubt many are vaccinated, but are not recorded: the law unfortunately encumbered the simple operation with so many forms and processes; and placed the management of it under an unpopular poor law commission, which every one had been even taught to dread; that we cannot be surprised if the operation is neglected: it is, however, a most sad state of things, that out of 1,973 children born, only 731 are known to have been vaccinated. I have often had occasion to see that the unvaccinated usually bring the disease into their respective neighbourhoods; it then passes to the least protected, and finally to others. The mortality from zymotic disease is 250, that is, one in five, and of these, 201 were children under 10 years of age; we seem to have a great underlying tendency to consumption, or rather to tubercular disease; this will account for the great fatality in some other diseases; such as measles, whooping cough, bronchitis, and pneumonia; in the ordinary way, and in fairly sound constitutions, few of these four diseases should prove fatal. It is now quite established, that with close over-crowded rooms; that is, by assiduously causing the continued breathing a tainted atmosphere; you may insure consumption in the most healthy: let such persons, with the disease so established, become parents; and you have a most fruitful crop of hereditary disease; and a state is produced which renders it very difficult for the young to overcome other diseases, such as those I have noticed. From neglect, privation and accidents, we have lost during the year, forty-five, ten at least of these were from starvation, literally from privation of food; twenty of this class were infants, many of whom met their deaths unfairly; and several, at least eight, directly from the close packing in over-crowded bed-rooms, found dead usually by the mother on awaking in the morning. There is a great deal of carelessness touching human life; and a great want of common sense or serious thought in the preserving it: much is left to chance: there is either fatalism, or a stolid indifference upon the matter, pervading English society; and the poor, 3 Supplement and Tables to complete the Annual Report, 1857. driven as they are from richer districts into poor neighbourhoods, can scarcely help themselves; they lose at last all healthy communication with richer or better neighbours, and all taste for pure air ar.d healthy pursuits; they pack close, they descend a little, often a great deal, toward the lower animals; and so live neither for this world nor the next. In Table 4 will be seen a contracted classification of age and death-cause in every place in the parish where more than one is recorded. In some future year T hope to give the level, the number of houses, of rooms, of inhabitants, their circumstances and habits, and the superficial space of every one of these places. The fifth, or last Table, shows a very imperfect classification of the sanitary work done; it has proved very uphill work, but the obstacles appear to be somewhat clearing away.* There are 7,000 houses in this parish; 890 of these have been visited this year, and in 756 the work ordered has been carried out; sometimes, I must say, in a most slovenly manner; an apparent compliance with your orders without the least intention of producing an efficient work; in the poorer districts the most incompetent men are employed to plaster over, patch over, whitewash or cover over, the evils ordered to be not covered but amended; still a great amount of good work has been done; 130 unclean, dilapidated houses have been cleansed and repaired; the inhabitants have been partially cleared from nine over-crowded houses; eleven only are so recorded, not that this represents all, for over-crowding is the normal stale in our poorer districts; small houses of four rooms are usually inhabited by three or four families, and by eight to sixteen or even twenty-four persons. 1 have this week seen two houses infested with the small-pox; in one are three families and fourteen persons occupying four rooms; in the other eight, or rather six rooms, there are eighteen persons. One of the cases noted in the Table had thirty-three persons in eight rooms; and another, 133 inhabitants in eight houses; 407 drains have been newly made or amended; 327 cesspools have been cleansed or abolished; 133 water-closets have been rendered fit for use; 167 yards have been more or less re-paved; this matter requires serious consideration, as the yards are generally in a very bad condition; the small ones ought to be completely paved; the larger, at least near the house and around the sinks; the neglected sloppy condition of these places is often indescribable, and a filthy yard generally involves a filthy house, and unclean habits. The removal of dust and refuse is, no doubt, belter effected than it was; but the work admits of an almost perfect organization; this parish, with its thousands of refuse heaps, requires the best management to keep the air untainted from this cause alone. Notices have been given to the police in some thirty cases of dangerous structures; no doubt life is saved this way, as many are old, perishing, and ready to fall, without much warning; twice have I, as parish surgeon, attended the sick in houses that have fallen within a week of my visit. In conclusion, it must be clear that all this work cannot have been effected without a great and good result. I know that we are on the right track, and am glad to learn that the good intentions of your officers, and the actual good done by them under your sanction, have met with the expressed approbation of many of the members of this vestry. I might multiply instances in proof of the good done, let one or two suffice; in Martin-street you will recollect my report of many cases of fever; twelve in three houses, and some deaths; and these houses had previously been infested with fever so intense, that visitors took the disease; these houses were cleansed, connected by pipe drains with sewer, and the old rotten brick drains that ran under the rooms were removed; this work was done two years ago, and done well; no fever, and very little illness, has appeared since. May Pole Alley, a cul-de-sac with its 23 houses and 180 people, was cnce a nest of the most infectious diseases. I attended, as parish surgeon, some ten cases of typhus there, some of them malignant enough to destroy life in forty-eight hours; with great trouble this court has been cleansed and amended, and although not what it should be, it is very much more healthy, as the district surgeon has more than once informed me; the diseases there are neither so numerous nor so intense.
