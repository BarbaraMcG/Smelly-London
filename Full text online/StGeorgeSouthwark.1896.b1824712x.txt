The foregoing return shows that the total actual attendances at the Vestry and Committee Meetings combined, from June 2nd, 1896 to the 4th May, 1897, have been 2,338 out of a possible 3,864, which gives a percentage of 60 5. The actual attendances at Vestry Meetings alone have been 829, out of a possible 1,248, a percentage of 66.4. Of the various Standing Committees, the Works shows the highest actual attendance, viz.: 392, with a percentage of 500. The actual attendances of the Public Health and Sewers Committee amount to 300, which yields a percentage of 56.8. The Finance comes next with an actual attendance of 228, and a percentage of 62.0; while the General Purposes Committee shows an actual attendance of 220, and a percentage of 57.2. Special Committees grouped together show an actual attendance of 220, with a percentage of 54.6, and SubCommittees an actual attendance of 140, and a percentage of 58.0. Vestry of St. George the Martyr. SOUTHWARK. ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1897. IN accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Manangement Acts, the Vestry presents the following Annual Report for the twelve months ending March 25th, 1897. As will be seen from the annexed Return of Attendances, the following meetings have been held during the year. Vestry Meetings 26 Standing Committee Meetings 129 Special Committee ,, 43 Sub-Committee ,, 48 246 It will be convenient to deal with the work of the Vestry by referring—first to those matters which have been actually dealt with during the year by the Authority itself, and subsequently to the principal matters which have claimed the consideration of the various Committees. 10 APPOINTMENT OF LIBRARY COMMISSIONERS. At the first meeting of the Vestry a report was received from the Board of Churchwardens and Overseers, to the effect that the result of the poll of the Parish on the question of the adoption of the Public Libraries Acts, had resulted in a majority of 1,814 in favour of the adoption of the Acts. The Yestry then proceeded to appoint the following nine persons as the first Commissioners for Public Libraries and Museums for the Parish, viz.:—Rev. T. G-. Gardiner, M.A., Mr. A. Hawkins, Mr. T. Haynes, Mr. T. Hunter, Mr. E. W. Knight, Miss Busk, Mr. Emary, Mr. James Pascall, Mr. G. Pocock. The Commissioners at once proceeded to take steps for the acquisition of a site for the erection thereon of the Public Library Buildings, the cost of which Mr. Passmore Edwards had so kindly promised to defray. School Board The question of the revision of the School Board Divisions Electoral Divisions in the Metropolis was considered by the Yestry on two occasions, and each time a resolution was adopted approving of the principle of the substitution of the Parliamentary Divisions for the present cumbrous School Board Electoral Divisions. A bill was subsequently promoted by Sir John Blundell Maple in the House of Commons having this object in view, but was rejected on second reading, Parliament preferring to adhere to the present system of cumulative voting. Bye-Laws. On the 14th May, 1896, an election was held to supply the places of one-third of the members of the Vestry retiring by rotation, and to fill vacancies which had occurred during the last year. At the first meeting of the newly-constituted Yestry, after the appointment of Chairman and Committees, a Special Committee was formed to consider the bye-laws regulating the procedure of the Vestry. The Committee revised the existing bye-laws and submitted them for approval at the next meeting of the Authority. The byelaws were then adopted and confirmed at the following meeting, and have, on the whole, been found to work very satisfactory. city & South. London Railway bill. This Bill, which was promoted by the City and South London Electrical Railway Company, had for its object granting of power to the Company to construct a duplicated 11 line from their station in the Borough to London Bridge, and for that purpose to make very extensive excavations in Borough High Street. When the Bill was in the House of Commons the Vestry merely presented a public petition against its being passed into law; but on the serious character of the measure being brought before the Authority, when the Bill was about to be introduced into the House of Lords, and the fact that it would authorize the Company to make large openings in Borough High Street for a very considerable period of time during the construction of the line, the Vestry resolved to present a petition against the [measure, and to take active steps to prevent its passing into law. Parliamentary Agents were employed, and other preparations made for a thorough opposition to the Bill before the Committee of the House, in case the Company did not comply with the requirements of the Vestry to insert clauses limiting the length of time during which the openings were to continue, and making certain provisions for the protection of the public, and the reduction of the size of the openings. An important matter connected with the Bill was the stability of St. George's Church. The Company proposed to make a very large excavation within a short distance of the foundations of the Church, and it was felt that some provisions ought to be inserted in the Bill for placing the responsibity of any damage that might ensue, upon the Company. After considerable correspondence, the Company practically agreed to the whole of the requirements of the Vestry. Clauses were thereupon drafted and inserted in the Bill, embodying the agreement thus arrived at, and the Vestry have every reason to congratulate the Parish upon the concessions obtained. Long Lane Improvement. Much gratification was felt in the early part of the year 1896, when it became known that the London County Council were proposing to take steps for the carrying out of an extensive improvement in Long Lane and Tabard Street, whereby Long Lane would be widened, Tabard Street continued through St. George's Churchyard to the Borough, and the congestion of traffic opposite the Church considerably lessened. After discussing the matter for several months, the County Council, on the 30th June, 12 1896, passed a resolution adopting the proposed scheme. This determination was on the same day reported to the Yestry, when a cordial vote of thanks was passed to the Council for the unanimous decision at which they had arrived, to execute the suggested improvements. "Inasmuch as owing to the conditions of life prevalent in the District, the well being of the inhabitants has been disastrously affected both by the lack of air-space, and the absence of the benefit of through traffic." The necessary proceedings for including the property in the Councils General Powers Bill were taken by that authority, and Parliamentary Notices were served on the Yestry in respect of the streets which would be interfered with. On receipt of these notices the Vestry formally assented to the proposal, and the Bill has now been passed into law. It is hoped that the Council will take an early opportunity of carrying out the scheme. Falcon Court area. The Vestry regret to have to report that owing to an oversight in one of the Government departments, the scheme for the taking of the Falcon Court area and for the acquisition by the London County Council of land in Borough Boad and Garden Bow, whereon to erect buildings for the housing of the persons displaced from that area, was not included in a Provisional Order Bill within the time limited by the Standing Orders of Parliament. On this information being received by the Yestry, they at once instructed the Chairman and Clerk to do all in their power to assist the County Council in endeavouring to insure the suspension of the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, so that the Bill might be passed during the session 1896. The Yestry regret to say that this attempt failed. A Bill has, however, been introduced by the Home Secretary into the House of Commons in the present session, for the purpose of confirming the Provisional Orders. city of London (inclusion of Southwark) Bill. One of the most important matters that has come under attention of the Yestry during the past year has been the Bill promoted by the Parishes of St. Saviour and Christ Church, having for its object the inclusion within the area of the City of London, of the Parishes of St. Saviour, Christ Chur&h, St. Olave, St. Thomas, Southwark, and St. John, Horsleydown, and 13 the transfer of their administration to the Commissioners of Sewers. The subject was brought to the notice of the Vestry on the 17th November, 1896 (the Bill not having been printed), when a Special Committee was appointed to report on the proposal. It was soon found that other Authorities were desirous of joining in the work of obtain" ing information with reference to the measure, and a suggestion was received from the St. Saviour's Union that a Special Committee appointed by the Board of Guardians should co-operate with the Vestry's Committee for that purpose. The Special Committee of the Vestry having agreed to this suggestion, deemed it advisable to invite the St. Olave's Board of Guardians and the Vestries of Newington, Berinondsey and Kotherhithe, to appoint representatives to confer with the Joint Committee on the subject. A Conference was held on the 14th December, 1896, of representatives of four of the Authorities above named, when it was determined that the representatives of each Authority should seek power from their respective Boards to. expend not more than £50 in obtaining information in reference to questions involved in the Bill. It was found that the provisions of the Bill were of such an extensive character as to necessitate the employment of an expert to report upon the measure, and the Conference determined to retain Mr. John Kemp, Barrister-at-law, for this purpose. The Boards of Guardians of St. Saviour's and St. Olave's Unions, and the Vestries of St. Mary, Newington, and St. George the Martyr, agreed to contribute toward the cost of obtaining information. Mr. Kemp subsequently submitted to the Conference a memorandum upon the historical aspect of the proposal, and at a later meeting a supplementary report on its financial effect. The Vestry in the meantime received a report from the Vestry Clerk on the general bearing of the proposal upon this Parish, and determined to present a petition against the Bill. Several other Authorities also petitioned against the measure, including the London County Council, whose Statistical Officer prepared a most exhaustive report upon the general and financial aspects of the Bill, as they affected the Council and the various Parishes and Local Authorities. One of the proposals of the Promoters was to the effect that the Union of St. Saviour's should be divided, and the rich Parishes of 14 Christ Church and St. Saviour transferred to the City of London Union, leaving the poorer Parishes of St. George the Martyr and St. Mary, Newington, to constitute a new Union. It was shown that this proposal could have no other effect than that of largely increasing the rates of these already over-burdened Parishes. Upon these facts becoming known a public agitation commenced, and meetings were held at the Bermondsey Town Hall, and at the Temperance Hall, Blackfriars Road, where resolutions in strong condemnation of the measure were passed, calling upon the Members of Parliament for the District to use their utmost endeavour to ensure its defeat. The Bill came before the House of Commons for second reading on the 22nd March, 1897, when, after a somewhat long and spirited debate, it was thrown out by a majority of 18. On the following night the Vestry passed a resolution thanking the Members of Parliament and Members of the County Council, who by speech and vote or otherwise, assisted in securing the rejection of the Bill. As it is not improbable that a similar measure may be introduced in a subsequent session of Parliament, the information which has been obtained by the Vestry cannot fail to be of great use in dealing with any such proposition. Appointment of Overseers. Early in the year 1895, the Vestry resolved to make application to the Local Government Board, for power under Section 33 of the Local Government Act, 1894, for the Vestry to appoint its own Overseers. A letter was subsequently received from the Board, stating that before such an order could be made the Sections of the Local Acts under which Overseers are appointed in this Parish would have to be repealed. The matter stood in abeyance for some little time, but on the 1st December, 1896, the Vestry passed a resolution applying to the Local Government Board for the alteration or repeal of the portions of the Local Acts as to the appointment of Overseers. This resolution was confirmed at the ensuing meeting of the Authority, and forwarded to the Local Government Board. On the 10th February, 1897, Mr. H. Lockwood, one of the Inspectors of the Board, held a Local Enquiry at the Vestry Hall, in reference to the application. Several ratepayers appeared in opposition to the proposal, but there is every hope that an order will shortly be issued in the terms of the application. 15 London Children's Asylums District. In January, 1897, a proposal was made for the constitution by the Local Government Board, of a new Authority of a similar character to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, for the purpose of dealing with children suffering from various diseases, or who were ordered by two justices or a magistrate to be taken under the Industrial Schools Act, 18G6, to a workhouse or an asylum of the district. It was felt that the constitution of another Metropolitan Authority was wholly unnecessary. Considerable feeling was expressed in various parts of London in opposition to the proposal, and on the 23rd February, 1897, the Vestry passed the following resolution:— "That, in the opinion of this Vestry, the ratepayers of the Metropolis are already over-burdened by the demands of central Authorities over which they have no control, and it regards with much anxiety, the creation of another Central Board, the 'London Children's Asylums District,' as proposed by the Local Government Board." The ratepayers of the Parish will learn with pleasure that the proposal has since been abandoned. Nelson Street Recreation Ground. The purchase and the laying out as an open space, of this ground has not yet been completed, but the negociations are now in an advanced state, and on the 9th February, the Vestry affixed its seal to an agreement with the County Council undertaking to pay £164 towards the cost of the purchase. Incorporation Question. A subject which has attracted a considerable amount of attention, not only in this Parish but throughout the polis, has been the application made by the Parishes of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, and St. Mary, Kensington, for grants of charters of incorporation for these districts. The Royal Commission of 1894 on London Government suggested that charters should be granted to certain of the larger Parishes of the Metropolis. Having in view, however, the number of Statutes under which London is governed, and their complicated nature, it has been found that it would be impossible to grant charters of incorporation similar to those of the various cities and boroughs of the country, or to constitute anything like independent municipalities. The only effect of the 16 proposed incorporation would be to change the names of the Authorities and the titles of their Members. Moreover, in the view of the Vestry and of a large number of persons throughout the Metropolis, the question of London Government was one requiring to be dealt with in its entirety, and not by separate action or piecemeal legislation. The Vestry accordingly passed the following resolution on the matter at a meeting held on the 23rd February, 1897 "That a Petition be presented to the Privy Council praying, that no Charter of Incorporation be granted to any District of London in priority to the remaining Districts, or without due consideration of the reform of Local Government as a whole." PUBLIC HEALTH AND SEWERS COMMITTEE. Female Inspector. One of the first matters that came under the attention of the Committee, was the question of the appointment of an Inspector to visit tenement houses. The Vestry having decided on the 16th June, 1896, to appoint a Female Inspector, the Committee deemed it advisable before proceeding to the appointment, to approach the Local Government Board on the question. The Board approved the appointment of a Female Inspector, and the matter was referred back to the Public Health Committee to obtain applications, and to submit selected candidates to the Vestry. Miss A. E. Elliott, of St. Helen's, was appointed, and the formal approval of the Local Government Board has since been obtained. Notification of Measles. Early in the year 1896, the Medical Officer of Health reported that, in his opinion, measles should be a notifiable disease. Dr. Waldo followed up this opinion by an article which appeared under his name in the "Nineteenth Century," and also in a report presented to the Vestry on the 14th July, 1896. A letter from the Vestry of St. Mary, Battersea, recommending the same course, having also been submitted to the Vestry, the whole question was referred to the Public Health Committee for consideration and report. The Committee carefully examined Dr. Thomson's treatise on the control of measles, published in the Local Government Board's Report for the year 1894-5, and came to the conclusion that "no sanitary Authority in London would be justified in embarking in so 17 great an expenditure as would be necessary for the compulsory notification of measles, unless it can be proved that corresponding results would be achieved; and no evidence has been adduced that this has been the case." For this and other reasons adduced in the Committee's lieport, they were unable to recommend the Vestry to take any further action in the matter. Salvation Army Shelter. A full report of the action brought by the Salvation Army against the Police Magistrate at Southwark and theVestry of St. George the Martyr will be found in the Appendix, of the Report of the M.O.H. It is unnecessary, therefore, to refer to it here further than to say that the Public Health Committee on the 6th July, 1896, passed a resolution expressing the opinion that it is desirable Salvation Army Shelters should be placed under the Common Lodging Houses Act, and urging the Local Government Board to take immediate steps for the amendment of the law accordingly. Inconvenient and Insanitary Buildings. The attention of the Committee has been called to certain new buildings, recently erected, which have been so constructed as to be on the whole of an inconvenient and insanitary character by reason of the narrowness of the cases, the lack of provision of separate sanitary conveniences for each floor, and the want of the necessary fittings for the storage of food, yet in which no provisions of the London Building Act, 1894, appearto have been technically violated. The subject has been brought by the Committee before the London County Council and the owners of the properties. It is hoped that the Council will use its influence with owners of property to insure that in all new buildings, not only the statutory requirements may be complied with, but that the comfort and convenience of the poorer classes of tenants—who are, by reason of the character of their employment, compelled to live in close proximity thereto—may be adequately secured. Boom Disinfection. Complaints having reached the Committee from various sources (including a report of the M.O.H., respecting an outbreak of diphtheria in Cornbury Street) that the disinfection of rooms throughout the Parish was not being carried out in an efficient manner, a Sub-Committee was appointed on the 9th 18 November, 1896, to make a thorough investigation of the methods employed by the Sanitary Department, and the instructions given by the M.O.H. in reference thereto. The Sub-Committee submitted their report to the Public Health Committee on the 27th November, 1896, and the Committee then prepared and presented to the Vestry a report, which will be found at page 35 of the appendix to the Annual Beport of the M.O.H. (annexed hereto). The M.O.H. submitted to the Vestry a special report in reply on the 15th December, and a special meeting of the Yestry was held on Wednesday, 16th December, to consider the matter. The following resolution was then adopted, and a copy was directed to be forwarded to the Local Government Board:— Besolved:—That this Vestry having heard the Medical Officer of Health's Beport of December 15th, replying to the Public Health Committee Beport of December 1st, regrets to observe that he has not dealt with the points therein raised. That, as head of the Sanitary Department, he is responsible to the Yestry for the due discharge of duty by the subordinate officials. That the doctor be required to observe scrupulously the undertaking which he signed as regards the hours of attendance and the specific requirements of the Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1891, and especially to keep books according to Article 18, Clause 14, in the before-mentioned Order, and That the Health Committee be instructed to make effectual the recommendations contained in their report of December 1st. Dr. Waldo submitted to the Vestry a supplementary report, with an appendix on the 12th January, 1897, when he was instructed to submit this report to a Special Committee then appointed to consider and report on the same. The Special Committee presented an exhaustive report to the Vestry on Dr. Waldo's Supplementary Beport of the 9th February, 1897, when the resolution on page 58 of the M.O.H.'s Annual Beport was adopted and forwarded to the Local Government Board. The Board's reply will be found in the report. 19 As these reports and resolutions speak for themselves, it is unnecessary to make any comment upon them here. Defective Sewers. The Committee have had their attention drawn from time to time by the Surveyor to the defective construction of a large number of sewers in the Parish. Two or three of the worst sewers have been relaid in the course of the year. In almost every instance it was discovered that the sewers had been laid upon principles wholly disapproved at the present day. These facts and the number of complaints received from time to time induced the Vestry on the 9th February, 1897, to pass a resolution directing the Surveyor, " To prepare a list of seriously defective sewers in the Parish, which are considered injurious and dangerous to the life of the inhabitants, with a view of relaying them, also to prepare estimates that the cost may be defrayed by monies raised by loan." Trinity Buildings. During the reconstruction of the buildings in Chapel Court, known as "Trinity Buildings," a large quantity of human bones were discovered. The Secretary of State was immediately communicated with on the matter, and he made an Order directing the removal of the bones to Ilford Cemetery, under the direction of the M.O.H. Reorganising of Public Health Department A large portion of the time of the Public Health Committee has been occupied in reorganising the staff and books of the department. The Vestry believe that the arrangements now in prospect will tend to the greater efficiency of the administration of the department. Works Committee. Height of Projections. On the 7th April, 1896, the Vestry passed a resolution to the effect that in future permission be refused for the erection of any lamp, sign, or notice board, or any other projection from any building, over the public footways or roadways unless such projection be at a minimum height of not less than eight feet from the level of such footways or roadway at the lowest point of projection. Eeception House. The question of the erection of temporary shelter or house accommodation for the members of any family in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who have been 20 pelled to leave their dwellings for t.he purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority has from time to time occupied the attention of the Vestry since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, but on the 7th April, 1896, a resolution was passed directing advertisements to be issued in various newspapers for tenders for the erection of such a building in accordance with the plans prepared by the Surveyor. In response to the advertisement however only one tender was received, and the matter was referred back to a Special Joint Committee for further consideration. Advertisements were again issued for tenders and on the 16th June, the tender of Mr. J. Carmichael, was accepted for the work of erecting the Reception House at the sum of £1,650. Application was then made to the London Council for a loan of that amount, but it was found that no statutory authority existed enabling them to sanction a loan of this nature. The County Council accordingly introduced into their General Powers Bill, section 32, providing that the erection of a building of this nature should form one of the purposes for which the Vestry might borrow under the provisions of section 105 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Act was passed immediately before the County Council's annual recess. It was necessary under the section for the Vestry to obtain the sanction of the Local Government Board, and a resolution directing application to be made to the board was passed on the 8th September, 1896. The Medical Inspector of the Board held a Public Enquiry at the Vestry Hall in reference to the application, on the 16th December, 1896, when considerable opposition was offered by several prominent ratepayers in the Parish and members of the Vestry. The Board however sanctioned the loan on the 15th day of February, 1897. The amount is repayable in 30 years. Owing to the length of time occupied in obtaining the sanction to the borrowing of the loan, it became necessary to apply to the Bridge House Estates Committee of the City Corporation, for an extension of the time within which buildings might be erected on the land in King James Street. The Committee very readily extended the time for a further period of 12 months. When the contractor (Mr. Carmichael), was however, asked to proceed with his tender for 21 the erection of the building, he declined so to do, on the ground that prices had considerably increased since his former quotation. The Vestry accordingly decided to re-advertise the work, and it is hoped that the building may be erected during the ensuing year. Paving streets. It is not necessary to report in detail the various streets and roads which have been repaved during the past year, but among the principal works may be named the following:— Borough Road. The work of repaving the portion of this road between Southwark Bridge Road and Newington Causeway was completed in June, 1896. Southwark Bridge Road. The Vestry determined on the 16th June, 1896, to repave this road with 5-inch Jarrah dale Jarrah Wood Blocks. A loan of £1,450 was obtained from the London County Council for the purpose, repayable in seven years. The work was completed in December, 1896. On the application of the London Tramways Company, permission was given to the Company to lay down within the tram rails and on the margins, Pitch Pine Blocks. The Vestry will thus be enabled to judge of the relative wearing qualities of the two kinds of wood blocks laid down in this road. Lambeth Road and Elliott's Row Footpath. Owing to the portions of Lambeth Road directly opposite Upton Chapel and St. George's Cathedral which had hitherto been paved with wood blocks, being very considerably out of repair, the Vestry decided to repave them with Jarrah Wood Blocks, and at the same time to relay the tar paved footpath in Elliott's Row with York Paving. For this purpose a loan of £550 was asked for from the London County Council on the 1st December, 1896. The Finance Committee of the Council pointed out in reply, that the Council had made a Standing Order not to grant loans of less than £1,000. A further representation was, however, made to the Committee, and the loan granted. The work of paving the portions of Lambeth Road is now being proceeded with. 22 New Kent Road. The portions of the roadway between the channels and the tram margins being considerably worn, the Vestry have relaid the same. Upper Grange Road. Petitions have from time to time been presented to the Vestry, asking that, as the traffic from the Tower Bridge had largely increased and the noise thereby created had been considerably augmented, the roadway within the Parish might be paved with wood. The roadway needing considerable repair, an opportunity occurred for the Vestry to comply with these requests. The Vestry of Camberwell agreed, on this Vestry consenting to execute the work, to contribute ,£180 towards the cost. This arrangement was agreed to by the Vestry on the 9th March, 1897, and the work will shortly be proceeded with. Old Kent Road Footway. Application having been made by Messrs. Battley Sons & Holness, the builders who were erecting Mr. Goodrich's new premises at the corner of the Old Kent Road and Bermondsey New Road, for the footpath adjoining the Old Kent Road side of the premises to be lowered, the Vestry instructed the Surveyor on the 16th June, 1896, to bring up a report, together with plan and estimate, for lowering the footpath and substituting a single curb for the present double one. It was subsequently ascertained that other persons having premises abutting on the raised footway objected to the footway being lowered; and after careful consideration of the matter by the Works Committee, the Vestry finally determined on the 22nd September, 1896, to take no further action with regard to the proposed improvement. Underground Telephone Wires. The National Telephone Company Limited, having made application for permission to lay underground mains along some of the principal roadways in the Parish, the question was referred to the Works Committee. On the 28th July, 181)6, the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Committee, agreed that they would be prepared to consent to the Company laying their mains underground subject to their entering into an agreemeut embodying certain stipulations as to superintendence of work, 23 hole covers and reinstatement of roads, and that the Company paid a rental of £500 per annum to the Vestry. The Company agreed to the stipulations but declined to pay the amount specified, and made an offer of 1/- per annum for the easements. This offer the Vestry declined to accept, but the Committee agreed to receive a deputation from the Company. After interviews between representatives of the Company and the Committee and correspondence, the Vestry on the 3rd November, 1896, passed a resolution refusing to grant permission for the mains to be laid underground throughout the Parish unless the Company were prepared to make a substantial offer for the proposed wayleave. On a further application being made by the Company in March, 1897, this resolution was adhered to. Drinking Fountains. An offer having been received from the Metropolitan Drinking Fountains Association, to erect a granite drinking trough in St. George's Circus, the Vestry agreed to the recommendation of the Works Committee to accept the offer on condition that no name of an advertising character be placed on the trough. A similar offer was also received from the Association to fix a Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough at a point opposite the Deaf and Dumb Asylum in the Old Kent Road, and this was also agreed to on practically the same conditions. The Vestry's thanks are due to the Association for so generously providing for the wants of persons and of horses and cattle passing through the Parish. General Purposes Committee. On the recommendation of this Committee the Vestry have dealt with the following matters of Public Interest:— 1. The Relief of Local Taxation. The Vestry concurred with the views of the Parishes of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, and of a Deputation who waited on the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this subject, that, having in view the heavy charges which fell upon the Ratepayers of London, an increased subvention should be granted by Parliament in relief of Local Taxation, out of Local Taxation Fund. 24 2. Sea "Water. In the early part of the year 1896, several posals were made, for bringing sea water to London and a Bill was introduced into the House of Commons dealing with the matter. The London County Council having submitted to the Vestry certain clauses which it was suggested should be inserted in this Bill, the clauses were adopted on the recommendation of the Committee. 3. Shops Early Closing Bill. After carefully considering the provisions of this measure, the Vestry came to the conclusion to approve the principle of the Bill, but expressed the opinion that it was advisable that the duty of carrying out its provisions should devolve upon a central authority and not be left in the hands of local bodies. 4. Water Supply. In the early part of the year 1896, a Conference of Local Authorities was held with regard to the question of the water supply of the Metropolis, at which the following opinions were expressed:— 1. That this Conference having in view the report of the Royal Commission on the Water Supply of the Metropolis (1893), is of opinion that no scheme should be proceeded with until proper enquiry has been made as to what economy of the existing supply could be effected by using unfiltered or sea water for sanitary purposes, and the probable cost. 2. That it is desirable to bring sea water to London for sewer flushing, street watering and other purposes. 3. That should the Water Companies interests not be chased, an obligation be imposed upon them to reduce their charges in the event of the scheme for bringing sea water to London being carried into effect, as regards those premises supplied therewith. 4. That in the opinion of this Conference, the Water Supply of London should be under the control of a body directly elected by the Ratepayers, and not in the hands of private Companies. 25 5. That a copy of the foregoing Besolutions be forwarded to the President of the Local Government Board, and to each of the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. On the question coming before the Vestry, they determined to concur with the views of the Conference. 5. Begistration of Clubs. On the suggestion of the Vestry of St. Anne, Westminster, the Vestry decided to present a petition to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department, praying him to bring in a Bill for the Begistration of all Clubs, and to make it illegal for private individuals to open clubs for the sale of excisable articles for their own profit without any real restrictions as to the conditions of membership; the object of the Bill being to prevent annoyance to residents in the neighbourhood, and the disturbance of public order arising from the conduct of persons frequenting so-called clubs. 6. Transfer of Powers. On the 5th November, 1895, the County Council passed a resolution requesting their Local Government and Taxation Committee to arrange a Conference between representatives of the Council and Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis to consider and report on the powers now possessed by the County Council, and the desirability of certain powers being transferred to the Local Authorities. The Conference convened in pursuance of this resolution held its meetings between January and May, 1896, and adopted a series of resolutions on various matters in connection with the general question of the transfer of powers to Local Authorities. No steps have as yet been taken to embody the recommendations of the Conference in statutory form, but the proceedings have been printed and copies were forwarded to the members Of the Vestry. 7. Begistration of Costermongers. On the suggestion of the Board of Works for the Wandsworth district, the Vestry at its meeting of the 30th June, 1896, expressed the opinion that 26 Local Authorities in London should be empowered to make bye-laws for regulating the standing of costermongers in streets. 8. Agricultural Rating Bill. The object of this Bill was to relieve the agricultural districts from Local Taxation by providing that occupiers of agricultural land in England should be liable in the case of rates, the proceeds of which are applicable to public local purposes, to pay half only of the rate in the pound payable in respect of buildings, &c.; any deficiency arising from the exemption being provided out of the Local Taxation account. The funds of this latter account are raised chiefly in the large cities and commercial centres of the kingdom, and it was shown that London would suffer very heavily by the operation of the measure. The Yestry in common with many other Authorities throughout the city, viewed the consequent increase in rating with some alarm and determined to present a petition against the Bill. 9. Cab Radius. A resolution was adopted to the effect that the time has now arrived for the present cab radius to be extended to 5 miles, or, if possible, to the whole radius of the County of London. Vestry Hall. Owing to the old stuffed bench seats of the Yestry Hall having become exceedingly dilapidated, the Vestry gave directions for the sale of the seats, and determined that chairs should be substituted therefor. Tenders for Chairs were obtained, and that of Messrs. Tarn & Co. for fifty oak chairs at the price of '22s. 6d. each was accepted. About the same time the ceiling of the Vestry Hall was washed, stopped and whitened, the upper portions of the walls distempered and stencilled, and the lower portions cleaned and varnished. Trees. Messrs. Ponsford's contract for providing and ing the trees in the highways of the Parish being about to expire, the Vestry determined on the 8th September, 1896, to carry out the work by their own workmen, under the supervision of the Surveyor. 27 Special Committees. Elephant and Castle Scheme. It having come to the knowledge of the Vestry that the Newington Vestry were proposing to lay before the London County Council a scheme for the setting back of the Elephant and Castle Public House for the purpose of widening the Walworth Road, and the headway, by the removal and re-erection of the block of buildings in such a position as to considerably reduce the width of Newington Butts, a Sub-Committee was appointed by the Vestry to report upon the matter. On receiving the report of the Committee as to the serious nature of the undertaking, the Vestry passed a resolution to the effect that "owing to the enormous amount of traffic passing along the Newington Butts, amounting to upwards of 9000 vehicles per day of 12 hours, the County Council be requested to withhold their sanction to any encroachment on that highway as suggested in the plan adopted by the Newington Vestry, and that the Couucil be asked to receive a deputation on the matter if they so desire." A deputation subsequently attended before the Building Acts Committee of the Council, and eventually, on the nature of the proposal becoming generally known, it was not proceeded with. The Paragon. A letter was received by the Vestry on the 23rd February, 1897, from Mr. Basil Holmes, secretary to the Metropolitan Gardens Association, stating that Lord Llangattock was prepared, in the re-arrangement of his estate, to permit the portion of ground known as "The Paragon" in New Kent Road to be transferred to the Vestry as a Public Garden for the sum of £3,400, towards which sum he was prepared to contribute £1,000; the letter also stated that the Association would be prepared, in the event of the Vestry seeing its way to purchase the ground under the Open Spaces Acts, to lay it out as a garden at its own expense. A special meeting of the Vestry was at once called to consider the offer, when it was referred to a Special Committee to report upon the matter. It was subsequently determined by the Committee to lay the whole of the facts relating to the offers of Lord Llangattock and the Association before the London County Council, and it is hoped that arrangements may be made whereby this piece of ground may be secured as a public garden for the residents of the district. 28 Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Considerable gratification was felt by the Vestry and inhabitants of the parish generally on learning that the Royal Procession on the occasion of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee Celebration would pass along Borough High Street, Borough Road, and Westminster Bridge Road, in the Parish. A Special Committee has been appointed to carry out all matters relating to the demonstration affecting this Parish only, including any arrangements it may be deemed advisable to make in connection with the Yestry Hall. Staff. Vestry Clerk's Department. Mr. J. A. Johnson, the newly appointed Yestry Clerk, entered upon his duties on the 15th April, 1896. During the months of June and July, 1896, a Sub-Committee appointed by the General Purposes Committee considered the question of the duties devolving on the various clerks composing the Yestry Clerk's Staff, and at the meeting of the Vestry on the 14th July, 1896, the Committee brought up a report containing revised duties to be allotted to each of the clerks in the department. Among the principal recommendations were that Mr. T. Brown should be appointed Accountant to the Vestry, that the Prime Cost Clerk should at once be transferred to the Yestry Clerk's department, and that these two officials, together with another clerk, should deal with the accounts of the Yestry and Charities; that the Overseers' work should be oarried out by two clerks, and that the work of keeping the minutes and correspondence of the Vestry and Committees should be done by the Committee clerk, assisted by the clerk who was then partially employed in the Sanitary Department. The latter olerk has since resigned his position. On the 6th October, 1896, the Vestry appointed a Special Committee to consider and report on the present salaries paid to the clerks, and instructed the Committee to bring up a scheme to avoid the constant applications for increases of salary. The reference to the Committee was subsequently enlarged to include not only the salaries but also the emoluments and duties of the clerks employed in the Yestry Offices. The Committee presented a report containing a 29 scheme for the periodical advance of the wages of the clerks to certain maximum amounts, and also embodied a scale of pay for clerks who may be appointed in the offices in future. Surveyor's Clerk. The question of the appointment of a clerk for the Surveyor to assist in the clerical work of the department, tracing, &c., having been considered and agreed to by the Vestry, applications were obtained, and on the 16th June, 1896, Mr. P. R. Cook, was appointed at the wages of 30/- per week. Caretakers Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler were on the 7th April, 1896, appointed Caretakers of the Yestry Hall. By order of the Vestry, J. A. JOHNSON, Yestry Clerk. Yestry Hall, Borough Road, June, 1897. 30 Report of Professional Accountants. 30, Moorgate Stbeet, London, E.C. 19th October, 1897. J. A. Johnson, Esq., The Vestry Hall, Borough Boad, S.E. Dear Sir:— We herewith beg to hand you the following Accounts, viz:—The Vestry's Liabilities and Assets Account, General and Sewer Bate, Income and Expenditure Account, Capital Account and Schedule of Loan and Stock Differences. The Income and Expenditure Account shews balances as follows £ s. d. In favour of the General Bate 552 1 11 In favour of the Sewer Bate 4283 8 6 £4835 10 5 The fact that there is so large a surplus on Sewer Bate Account shews that more money is being levied than is required, although the £4283 8s. 6d. includes £3296 19s. lOd. the amount of surplus at March 25th, 1896; the General Bate works out much more closely. The Liabilities and Assets Account shews the following figures:— Liabilities:— £ s. d.

The Equalization of Rates Act contribution has increased from £4121 0s. l0d. to £1921 2s. 6d., and the combined Eates levied were £37540 9s. l0d. against £40096 16s. 4d. in 1895/6. With regard to the Stocks Ledger we have annexed a list of differences between the Stock as shewn by the Stock Book and that actually in hand. The net result is a surplus of £98 8s. 4d. This is to a great extent due to inaccurate measurement during the year and inaccurate Stock taking at March 25th, 1896. We have audited the Overseers' Cash Book and Bate Books and also the Churchwardens' Charities Account. We would point out that if any further details of the Vestry's Accounts are required the Books will furnish them most completely.

Ladies And Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting you with my Second Report, of the principal works executed in my department, during the twelve months ended March 25th, last. Roads and Footways. The work of re-paving Great Suffolk Street, from King's Court to Parish Boundary, East Street, Borough Road from Newington Causeway to Southwark Bridge Road, with re-dressed setts, and 3in. by 9in. by 5⅜in. Jarrahdale Jarrah blocks, opposite the Schools in Borough Road, for which a loan of £1700 was obtained from the London County Council, was completed early in the year. The total cost of the work was £1629 9s. 9d. or about £75 within the estimated cost. Southwark Bridge Road from Newington Causeway to Borough Road was re-paved in December last, with 3in. by 9in. by 5in. Jarrahdale Jarrah blocks. The estimate of the cost of this work was £1483 6s. 0d., and a loan of £1450 was obtained from the London County Council for a period of seven years for this purpose. The actual cost of the work amounted to £1424 14s. 3d. The South London Tramways Company supplied Australian "stringy bark" blocks for their 18inch margins outside the tram rails, but the tram-road within the rails was paved by the Company with pitch pine blocks. 45 In repaying and repairing the various paved carriageways throughout the Parish, the following materials have been used:— Redressed Granite Setts 2342 yards super. Old Granite Setts 70 ,, ,, Jarrah Blocks 123,382 Pit Ballast 60 yards cube. Sharp Sand 173 ,, „ Thames Sand 21 „ „ Shingle 59 „ „ Pit Hoggin 12 ,, Cement 1200 sacks. Blue Lias Lime 115 ,, Pitch 38 tons 14 cwt. 2 qrs. Creosote 1177½ galls. Refined Tar 20 „ It has not been necessary to purchase any broken granite, for repairs to the macadam carriageways during the year, as an ample supply has been provided from the old macadam which was removed from Borough Road, and a quantity of old granite setts, useless for paving purposes, have also been broken up. In the repairs to macadam carriageways, 678 cubic yards of old macadam, 106 cubic yards of broken granite, and 156 cubic yards of fine siftings for binding, have been used from stock. The total cost of repairing the macadam carriageways, allowing 12/- per cubic yard for the old macadam, amounted to .£839 13s. 3d. The materials used in repairing asphalte carriageways and footways, and other Footpath Paving are as follows:— ASPHALTE CARRIAGEWAYS. Asphalte 26½ cwt. Bitumen 81 lbs. Coke 14 cwt. Cement 5 sacks. Sharp Sand ¾ cube yard. Siftings 1 „ Thames Ballast ¼ „ Macadam 2 „ ASPHALTE FOOTWAYS. Asphalte 259¼ cwt. Bitumen 8 cwt. 43 lbs. 46 Coke 115 cwt. Pitch 1½ cwt. Creosote 8½ galls.

Sand „ Ballast 6 „ Sittings 2 „ Trench openings in Public Highways. The following is a list of the number of trenches which were opened during the year, in carriageways and footways throughout the Parish, by the various public companies:— No. of Openings. South Metropolitan Gas Co. 732 Southwark & Vanuxhall Water Co. 296 Lambeth Water Co. 274 Gas Light and Coke Co. 86 London Electric Supply Corporation 13 London Hydraulic Power Co. 3 Post Office Telegraphs 2 Total 1406 The cost of executing the repairs and making good the paving disturbed, amounted to £612 10s. 4d. A Voucher for each opening has to be sent in, stating size of the opening, and the description of the paving disturbed. These measurements have to be checked in 47 each case, and the paving reinstated by the Vestry's Staff, and an account rendered to the Company concerned. The repairs of making good the paving disturbed by hoardings, &c., amounted to £233 5s. 7d. The following is a summary of the materials used in repairing these trenches. PRIVATE ROADWORK.

The following is a return of the amount of the dust and slop removed during the year, and barged away by Mr. Mtirrell from Blackfriars Bridge Wharf:— 48 Statement shewing quantities of Dust and Slop, carted to Mr. Murrell's Wharf, Blackfriars Bridge—March 26th, 1896, to March 25th, 1897.

The total shewing 336 tons less "Dust," and 715 tons less "Slop," or a total of 1051 tons less than the preceding year. The reduction in the case of Slop is satisfactory, and is no doubt principally due to the extension of permanent road paving at Borough Road, East Street, Webber Street, &c. Snow Storms. There were only three slight snow storms during the year, in January last. The Vestry's staff were able to deal almost entirely with the removal of the snow, and only on one occasion was it found necessary to put on twenty additional men, to enable the thoroughfares to be quickly cleared. Wheelwrights' Department. The four new vans which were in hand during the previous year were completed early in the year, at a total cost, including all charges, of .£233 0s. 9d. This result was very unsatisfactory and a special inquiry was made by the Works Committee into the reason of the excessive cost, and owing to the friction existing Strand District Board.

Several slop vans, water vans, and carts have been thoroughly overhauled and repaired during the year, at a total cost of £164 19s. 8d. SEWERAGE. The re-laying of the Earl Street Sewer, which was commenced in the preceding year, was completed in June last, at a total cost of £153 12s. 6d. The estimated cost was £172. The pipe sewer in Quilp Street has been taken up, relaid, diverted, and connected with the low level sewer in Marshalsea Road, at a cost of £53 8s. 9d. The pipe sewer in Cornbury Street has been relaid to proper falls at total cost of £53 6s. 4d. The pipe sewer throughout Webber Street is being taken up and relaid, and the work is still in progress at the date of this Report. All the foregoing pipe sewers were found in a very defective condition. No jointing material was found in the sockets, and the sewers were consequently leaky throughout. As regards line and gradient, the sewers had evidently been constructed in a very haphazard manner. The high level brick sewer in Borough Road, has been connected with the low level sewer at St. George's Circus end, at a cost of £12 1s. 10d. The total amount expended in repairs and reconstruction of sewers was £543 17s. 7d. Several cases of combined drainage have been dealt with by the Vestry during the year, and it is still very unsatisfactory to know that the law with respect to combined drainage has not yet been put on an equitable basis.

During the year, 30 applications accompanied by plans of new drainage of 83 premises, were submitted to, and approved by, the Public Health and Sewers Committee. Each drain was carefully examined whilst being laid, and thoroughly tested with the water test on completion. Sewer Ventilation. During the year the London County Council, on the representation of the Vestry, fixed a pipe ventilator from the Council's main sewer in Borough High Street, opposite St. George's Church, and the surface ventilator at this point, which had been a source of much complaint, was then closed. Draft Bye-Laws, submitted by the London County Council under Section 202 Metropolis Management Act, 1855:— A copy of the draft Bye-Laws, with respect to drainage, was received from the London County Council in December last. I submitted a report to the Public Health and Sewers Committee on the proposed Bye-Laws, and suggested several modifications and additions which seemed desirable. These were approved by the Committee and forwarded to the London County Council. 53 SICK PAY. During the year, sick pay on account of sickness and accidents, has been paid to 22 men, amounting to £137 7s. 0d. RECEPTION HOUSE. Plans and specifications were prepared for the Erection of a "Reception House," with Caretaker's House, on a site adjoining the Vestry's Stone Yard at King James Street. After advertising for tenders, the tender of Mr. J. Carmichael amounting to £1,650 was accepted on June 16th last, and the Vestry resolved to apply for a loan, extending the payment over 50 years. ALTERATIONS AT VESTRY HALL. During last summer, I was instructed by the General Purposes Committee to prepare plans and specifications for alterations in the Vestry Clerk's and Sanitary Offices. This work was carried out by Messrs. Homewood & Bowers, at a cost of £70. The Vestry Hall was cleaned and re-decorated by Mr. Wynne, at a cost of £29. At the same time, the old benches in the Vestry Hall were removed, and new oak chairs provided for the members' use, costing £56 5s. Od. SWAN STREET IMPROVEMENT. The drainage of the stables has been entirely re-constructed, and the interior of the horse keeper's house put in proper repair. LONG LANE IMPROVEMENT. The London County Council adopted the plan approved by the Vestry for the widening of Long Lane, and the new spur road through St. George's Churchyard, and applied for powers under their General Powers Bill, submitted to Parliament in the present session, to carry out this improvement. WOOD PAVING. I have prepared a Schedule which gives particulars of the wood paved carriageways throughout the Parish, shewing date when laid, area, cost, and other details. The whole of the roads have been carefully measured, as I have been unable to find any record of the area of the paving which has been previously laid. 54 55 Schedule of Wood- Paved Roads in Parish.

I submitted a report on the proposals of the City and South London Railway, in connection with further works for which they applied to Parliament this session for powers to carry out in Borough High Street, and made certain recommendations as to the proper protection of the interests of this Parish, in connection with temporary openings which the Company required to make in this important thoroughfare. DRINKING TROUGHS. During the year the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association have placed, with the consent of the Vestry, a horse trough and drinking fountain at St. George's Circus, and a horse trough at Old Kent Road, opposite the Deaf and Dumb Asylum. MISCELLANEOUS. Sixty-one licenses for opening trenches and erecting hoardings, &c., have been issued, and the work measured and brought into account. 1,133 Orders have been issued to contractors and tradesmen, for work, materials, &c., which have been checked and supervised, and the accounts examined and certified, and presented to the several Committees. STREET LIGHTING. Experiments have been continued by the South Metropolitan Gas Co., with lighting the ordinary Street Lanterns with Incandescent Burners, but the result does not appear to be very satisfactory. Considerable advance has, however, been made, and improvements effected in the appliances which tend to minimise the vibration and also to lengthen the life of the mantles in the lamps on the public highways. A two-burner Incandescent gas lamp has recently been fixed in Borough High Street, opposite St. George's Church, which I think will probably give very good results, and provide increased light at less cost than the ordinary two or three burner lamp. 57 HORSE RETURN.

Four horses were purchased during the year, and it is worthy of record that at the London Cart Horse Parade, at Regent's Park 011 Whit Monday last, the Shire Horse Society awarded the Yestry, in respect of one of the new horses " Beauty," one of the Society's silver medals, offered for the ten best single horses, irrespective of breed, at the Parade.

To the Vestry of the Parish of St. George the Mabtyr. SECTION I—STATISTICAL. Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fifth Annual Report, which I now have the honour to submit to you, treats of the sanitary condition and environment, for the year 1896, of the most densely populated district in London, and, indeed, for that matter, in the United Kingdom. The following summary of facts will be found useful in approaching the various matters contained in this report. Area.—St. George's, Southwark, covers 284⅓ acres. The roads and streets, as returned to the end of 1896, measure 19 miles, 5 furlongs, 14 poles. 4 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Boundaries.—The parish, in shape somewhat like a hatchet, is surrounded by no less than six other Sanitary Districts. It is bounded on the north by St. Saviour and St. Olave, on the west by Lambeth, on the south by Newington and Camberwell, and on the east by Bermondsey. Geological Formation.—The sub-soil of Southwark consists of porous " made " earth, sand, and gravel, of a depth of fifteen to twenty-five feet, overlying the London clay. Saline springs rise at times to the surface, and in certain excavated parts of the parish—e.g., Theatre and Music Hall, necessitate the constant use of pumps. Elevation.—The district is low-lying and flat, and is situate at an average of half a foot below the Trinity high water mark of the Thames, as against a mean elevation for London of 47.5 feet above the same mark. Houses.—I am indebted to the Medical Officer of the Administrative County for a copy of the Superintendent Registrar's Summary, giving the numbers resident in the district on the 29th March, 1896. This Summary—given under Table I.—shows also there were 5,512 inhabited and 657 uninhabited houses which makes an average of 10.9 persons to a house. TABLE I. London Census, 1896.

Its number of tenements is almost exactly double that of its inhabited houses. Of the tenement occupiers, one-third live in two rooms, and another third in a single room. There is no reason to alter the statement advanced for several years past that about one in every fourteen of your population is born, grows up, lives, works, and often dies within the four walls of a one-roomed tenement. Annual Report Medical Officer of the of Health—1896. 5 Population.—The number of inhabitants for the whole parish, according to the Census of 29th March, 1896, was 60,278 as against 59,712 in the Census of 1891. The rate of increase is extremely low, compared with that of London generally. Births and Birth=Rate. Table II. gives the birth.rate per 1,000 per annum for the years 1894, 1895 and 1896 in each sub.district of the parish, in London, and in the thirty.three large English towns. TABLE II. Sub.District. Birth.rate per 1,000. 1894. 1895. 1896. Borough Boad 37.3 38.2 39.4 London Boad 37.6 30.8 32.6 Kent Boad 28.5 39.6 37.8 Whole Parish 34.4 36.0 36.6 London 30.1 30.4 30.4 33 large English Towns 30.9 31.6 30.7 It will be seen that the birth.rate is .6 higher than that of the preceding year, and is considerably above that for the whole of London. The diminished rate of increase of population in the three sub.districts of the parish of St. George's is, therefore, not attributable to a falling off in the number of persons born into the parish, but rather to a relatively high death.rate. A reference to the section on the mortality of infants and children will reveal the startling fact that in the year 1896 more than one.half of the total deaths in St. George's, Southwark, has taken place under five years of age. The fact is notable that the birth.rate in St. George's is higher than in London and in the thirty.three large towns. This may, I think, be partly explained by the fact that limitation of families is carried into effect by the better.to.do classes rather than by the poor. * Deaths and Death=Rate for 1896. 1,293 deaths were registered in the parish during the fifty.three weeks ending 2nd January, 1897, giving an average of 24.3 per week. Of this total 215 were deaths of non.parishioners in hospitals and asylums within the district. In addition 254 parishioners died in outside public institutions and extra.metropolitan asylums. There were, therefore, 1,332 deaths among your parishioners, equivalent to an average mortality of 22.9 per 1,000. The death.rate for all London in the same year was 18.2 per 1,000, which is in itself, according to many authorities, 2.2 more per 1.000 than should occur from " the mortality incident to human nature." In St. George's, then, the "death.toll," as it has been aptly called, claims 4.7 persons out of every 1,000 in excess of an already excessive rate. On the latter estimate, that of the whole of * All calculations in this Report dealing with population statistics are based on the enumeration taken on the 29th March, 1896; that is, the quinquennial census taken for the purposes of the Equalisation Act of 1894. 6 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. London, there have been some 280 unnecessary deaths in St. George's, Southwark, during the year 1896. In the forty.three metropolitan sanitary areas, the lowest death.rates were 11.7 in Hampstead, 12.1 in Stoke Newington, 13 3 in Lee, 133 in Wandsworth, 14.2 in Plumstead, and 14 4 in St. George's, Hanover Square ; in the other districts the rates ranged to 23.6 in Limehouse, 24.9 in St. George's in the East and 25.8 in St. Luke's. The facts of your death.rate are briefly as follows:- TABLE III. Sub-District. No. of Deaths. Death-rate per 1,000. Deaths under 1 year to 1,000 Births. 1896. 1895. 1896. 1895. 1896. 1895.

One is naturally led to enquire whether a further analysis of facts and figures will throw any light upon this state of affairs. On comparing the average death.rate in the Three Sub.districts for the years 1892.3.4.5.6 with that of 1896 we find:- TABLE IV. Sub-District. Death-rate per 1,000. 1892-3-4-5-6 1896 Borough Road 30.5 27.2 London Road 20.3 20.2 Kent Road 21.0 21'4 Hence we see the heavy death.rate in the Borough Road Sub-District has somewhat decreased. During the past year the mortality in the Borough Road has been seven over that of the London Road, and 5.8 over that of the Kent Road areas. The period over which these figures extend—five years—and the actual number of deaths are both too small to allow of drawing any absolutely sound conclusions. Nevertheless, it may be noticed that the mortality of the Borough Road Sub.District is 4.5 higher than that of Liverpool for the year 1896. The latter place had the highest death.rate of the thirty.three large English towns. Further, the figures, so far as they extend, show that the excessive mortality of the Borough Road Sub.District is maintained from year to year, so that it appears to be due to inherent and not to accidental causos. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. 7 Although there is certainly some reason for alarm at the death.rate of the Borough Road Sub-District, yet one cannot help feeling a good deal of satisfaction with the figures for the whole parish during the past year. The annual death.rate for 1896 has dropped to 22.9 as against 23.7 in 1895. This fall of 08 brings the result within 4.7 of that of the whole of London. Moreover, if we take the recorded rate for the past 50 years we find that there has been a decrease from thirty in the decade 1841.50 to 22.9 in 1896. It is gratifying to be able to report that the yearly decrease in the death.rate has been maintained. Last year the death.rate of this parish touched the lowest point recorded for the last half century; in fact, since official returns of this kind have been systematically recorded. This result certainly appears to furnish a striking proof of the value of sanitary progress to the community. At the same time it should be borne ill mind that there is still room for large and permanent reduction in the death.rate of St. George the Martyr. Were it possible to eliminate the Borough Road Sub.District, or to reduce its mortality to a level with that of the other sub. districts, the condition of St. George the Martyr, as a whole, would compare favourably with many districts much more happily situated both as regards density of population and general healthiness of surroundings.

It may be noted that the term "zymotic" applies to the following seven diseases : —Small pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, "fever" (i.e., typhus, relapsing, puerperal, simple continued and typhoid) and diarrhoea. I have called the above zymotic diseases "preventable," because I regard all communicable disease, broadly speaking, as coming under that heading. Diarrhoea is a symptom rather than a disease, and, although not usually communicated from one person to another, it may be regarded as the almost invariable result of bad environment. At the same time, it must be clearly understood that a vast amount of preventable disease such as that due to alcoholism, is not zymotic in the ordinary sense of the term—that is to say, a disease condition communicable from the sick to the healthy. The corrected death rate in St. George's, Southwark, from the seven principal zymotic diseases was 3.4 per 1,000 in 1896, as against 3T per 1,000 in the whole of London for the same period, and 2.8 in the thirty.three great towns of England and Wales. 8 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. As in the calculation of the general death.rate, so with the zymotic death.rate, the deaths of non-parishioners occurring within the district have been excluded; on the other hand, the deaths of parishioners in public institutions outside the parish have been included. Unless a proper distribution of these deaths be made, especially of those from zymotic diseases, no really trustworthy data can be secured upon which to calculate the rates of mortality. In the forty.three sanitary areas of the metropolis the zymotic death.rates ranged from 1.3 in St. George's, Hanover Square, 1.4 in London City, 1.8 in Hampstead and in Lee, 2.1 in Westminster; and the highest, 3.9 in Woolwich, Chelsea, and Limehouse, 4.2 in Bethnal Green, 4.3 in Shoreditch, and 4.8 in St. Olave, Southwark. Proposed Reception House. The importance of a Reception House for the housing of those who have been exposed to the risks of infection can hardly be over.estimated in any well considered scheme of disease prevention for your parish. The main value lies in affording temporary shelter to such persons while disinfection is being carried out in their houses. Ever since my tenure of office as your Medical Officer of Health, I have urged the necessity of such a provision. In the year 1895 your Vestry formally decided to erect such a building, and acquired for the purpose an excellent site adjoining the Stone Yard. In the following year, 1896, the one under report, a further important step was taken in the shape of an Inquiry by the Local Government Board as to the desirability of the Vestry obtaining the funds necessary for the Proposed Reception House by a loan from the London County Council. After hearing evidence on both sides of the case, the Inspector reported to the Local Government Board, which shortly afterwards sanctioned the proposed loan. TABLE VI.—For the Year 1896.

The mortality from measles, diarrhoea, and whooping cough is seen from the foregoing table to be excessive in St .George's, as compared with all London. The absence of deaths from small-pox is in itself a valuable evidence as to the efficiency of modern preventive measures of vaccination, together with notification and prompt isolation. Measles. Measles is still the most deadly complaint in your parish. It heads the table of mortality from zymotic diseases, both in St. George's, Southwark, and in the whole of London. This waste of life, in my opinion, may be traced to the following causes:- (1) Measles, although highly infectious, is non-notifiable ; and, therefore, outside the control of your Sanitary Authority. (2) It is generally looked upon as a mild disorder that wants little or no treatment, whereas it requires careful isolation and nursing, as it is liable to many grave accidents. (3) Bad environment: measles does little harm among the well-to-do, but among the poor it is estimated that twenty to thirty die out of every hundred attacked by the disease. The Registrar-General, in his Annual Summary for 1896, says:—"Measles was the certified cause of 3697 deaths (in London) during the year; these deaths being equal to a rate of 0.82 per 1,000, as compared with 0.61, the decennial average rate. In London, measles appears to have been more fatal last year than in any previous year on record, with the single exception of the year 1864. Amongst metropolitan sanitary areas the lowest rates were 0.15 in Stoke Newington, 019 in the City of London, and 0.33 in St. Margaret, Westminster; the highest rates were 1.26 in St. George, Southwark, 1.33 in St. James, Westminster, 136 in St. Marylebone, and 1.71 in Woolwich." As frequently pointed out by me before, I think that the compulsory notification of cases of measles throughout London, with subsequent hospital treatment and disinfection, could not fail, in a poor parish like St, George's, to result in a great saving of life. Increased Parish flortality from Diphtheria. There has been an increase in deaths from diphtheria. During 1895 the total cases were 19 only, as against 49 for the previous year, but the number has risen to 26 (not including 13 cases notified as membranous croup) in 1896. In St. George's it has been less fatal than throughout London generally, in the proportion of 26 to 36. An outbreak in Cornbury Street is dealt with in a special report, to be found in Appendix In that report the means of prevention are discussed. The Salvation Army Shelter. This institution, as I mentioned in last year's report, was founded by Mr. Booth for the night shelter of poor persons. Although, no doubt, started on philanthropic lines, a charge is made for accommodation, and there is no attempt to disguise the fact that enterprises of a similar kind are not only self-supporting, but are even carried on at a profit. Notwithstanding this commercial aspect of the case, in the Court of Appeal Her Majesty's Judges decided that these Shelters did not fall within the regulations of the Common Lodging Houses Act. Another judicial decision showed that such institutions did not come under the Public Health (London) Act so far as disinfection was concerned. On that occasion Mr. Justice Wills said that "the case was clearly one in which the Act ought to apply, but does not." 10 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. During the year 1896 the Salvation Army authorities attempted to upset the decision of Mr. Slade in 1895 convicting them of gross overcrowding. The case was decided in favour of Mr. Slade. There is reason to believe that, in consequence of the proceedings undertaken from time to time by your Vestry, the numbers admitted to the Blackfriars Shelter have been materially decreased. Apart from that fact, however, the sanitary control over this large collection of poverty-stricken people housed nightly in the building in question is still in an unsatisfactory condition. Some idea of the cost of this undertaking to the ratepayers may be gathered from a paper printed in the Appendix (page 28). Respiratory Diseases. TABLE VIII. Sub-District. No. of Deaths—1895.

This rate is above that of the whole of London. The excess may, I think, be traced to the overcrowded state of the parish, both as to tenements and to workshops, and to the number of indoor occupations which predispose to respiratory diseases. A good deal of the mortality among young children is due to lung troubles, which often follow measles and whooping cough. The returns of deaths from consumption are not so heavy as one would expect in so densely crowded and poverty-stricken a district. At the same time it should be noted that the registrars have to depend for these figures on the death certificates, and there can be no doubt that a certain number of cases are not correctly described. This applies especially to alcoholism, and to such hereditary and constitutional disorders as syphilis and consumption. Mortality of Infants and Children. The death-rates of infants under one year, and of children under five years, afford valuable indirect evidence of the sanitary well-being of a community. By this I do not mean that all preventable infant and child mortality is to be attributed to defective sanitation. Other factors—to be mentioned further on—doubtless play a considerable part in either destroying or crippling the lives of these slum-bred children. The fact remains, however, that the most sensitive test of the sanitary condition of a district lies in the death-rate prevailing among its young population. During 1896 the number of infants who died within the first year of life in St. George's was 366. These figures give the high rate of 183 deaths to every 1,000 births in St. George's as compared with 161 deaths per 1,000 births for London. The average rate for the years 1892-3-4-5-6, for St. George's was 194, and for the Borough Road Sub-district 225, as against 158 for London. Of a total of 1,332 deaths at all ages in St. George's, 616 occurred under five years, which gives the large percentage of 53.8 of the total number of deaths. It is Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. 11 well known to specialists in children's diseases that " wasting " constitutes one of the commonest causes of death among infants. Thousands of children die every year in London simply because they are fed on food which they cannot digest, and which acts as an irritant to the stomach and intestines. The following are the most prominent Diseases causing the Infant Mortality under one year of age:- TABLE IX. Deaths 1892. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. Diarrhoea 23 43 54 41 35 Tabes Mesenterica (bowel phthisis) 22 58 16 37 10 38 27 30 56 Tubercular Meningitis, Hydrocephalus 20 10 12 10 14 Other Tubercular & Scrofulous Diseases 16 11 16 14 12 Premature Birth 24 36 44 39 28 Convulsions 35 41 63 69 42 Bronchitis 45 50 44 40 5 Pneumonia 32 24 16 38 38 Dentition 21 14 22 35 23 Whooping Cough 11 20 29 30 26 Suffocation in bed 11 12 20 16 15 Debility, Atrophy, and Inanition 42 84 88 69 65 Other causes not specified or ill-defined 34 6 8 24 44 Total 336 367 426 452 377 From the foregoing list it is seen that "debility, atrophy, and inanitation," is returned as the chief cause of infantile death in St. George's. This ill-defined group refers mainly to chronic wasting disease, produced by malnutrition, which is again a consequence of improper feeding. The infants fed on mother's milk for the most part escape these fatal consequences, which chiefly aSect children brought up by hand. The many causes leading to loss of infant life in St. George's may be thus summarised:- (1) Bad environment, such as insanitary conditions, overcrowding and absence of parks and open spaces. (2) Improper and insufficient food. (3) Mismanagement through maternal ignorance. (4) Early marriages. (5) Debility, disease and dissipation of parents. (6) Maternal neglect, due to mothers being more or less employed away from home in factories and workshops. (6) Use of opiates; usually in the form of patent medicines. The question of how to lessen the excessive destruction of child-life is an important one. It is a complex result traceable to many causes, each of which demands careful consideration and separate treatment. Among general measures it may be broadly stated that anything which tends to raise the standard of wholesomeness of a district will also help to diminish the infantile death-rate. Another valuable aid to prevention would be the education of parents generally in the simpler laws of healthy living with special reference to the diet and clothing of their oSspring. Without active and intelligent help on the part of those interested in the care of children, special measures of the local authorities will be of little avail in checking the disastrous loss of life which occurs under five years of age in all our great centres of population. Before leaving this subject I would again urge upon your Vestry the desirability of the founding of creches. The necessary site for such a day nursery might perhaps be found in the Falcon Court Area, which should be available to a greater or less extent for public purposes. Another portion of the Area might with advantage be laid out as a playground for the children of this poor and crowded district. 12 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Table X.

Section II.—GENERAL. The Need of Further Public Lavatory Accommodation. Under the powers conferred by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, your Authority constructed an underground convenience near the "Elephant and Castle," in the year 1893. This Lavatory was built for men only, and has proved, by its steady and increasing income, that it Was satisfied a public want. I would again suggest as in my Report, for 1895, vhat the Vestry considerably increase the present Public Lavatory accommodation, which is needed, not only for the inhabitants of this populous parish, but for the many wayfarers that pass through its busy streets. Two sites that appear to me particularly suitable for the purpose are :—first, the junction of the Old and New Kent Roads ; and, the other, the Obelisk at St. George's Circus. Experience has shown that these underground conveniences become a paying parish property from an economical point of view, particularly as the money required for their obstruction may be borrowed under the Act. Before leaving this matter, I may, perhaps, point out that, according to modern views, this kind of necessary accommodation should be provided for women, as well as for men. As a first step in a right direction, a Women's Lavatory might be added to the one existing near the "Elephant and Castle." Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. SECTION 26 (2) of the ACT 53 and 54, VIC., c 8, as amended by SECTION 4 of the ACT 54 and 55 VIC., c. 25. SPECIAL REPORT. During the past few days my " immediate " attention has been drawn, under the provisions of the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts to the sanitary condition of between 800 and 900 dwellings in this parish. This duty has been brought to my notice by owners of property with a view to obtaining certificates by virtue of which exemption from inhabited house duty may be claimed under the Inland Revenue Acts. The sudden request for these certificates is a natural consequence of the Quinquennial Valuation now in course of settlement within the Metropolis. On a rough calculation I estimate that applications in the case of upwards of 3,000 tenements will be applied for within the next few weeks. If such a conjecture prove a correct one the work entailed thoroughly and conscientiously carried out, will cover a period of some months. The Act of 1890 s. 26 sub-section 2 provides that " the Assessment of inhabited house duty of any house originally built or adapted by additions or alterations and used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding for each dwelling the rate of 7/6 a week, and occupied only by persons paying such rents, shall be discharged by the said Commissioners, providing that a certificate of the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the house is situated, or other Medical Practitioner appointed as hereinafter provided, shall be produced to them to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements. The Medical Officer of Health of a district on request by the person who would be liable to pay the bouse duty on any house in the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1896. 15 district, if the duty were not discharged as aforesaid, shall examine the house for the purpose of ascertaining whether such a certificate can properly be given, and if the house be constructed so as to afford such accommodation, and due provision be made as aforesaid, shall certify the same accordingly, provided that the Authority, if they are of opinion that the duties which would devolve on the Medical Officer of Health under this section could not be performed by him without interference with the due performance of his ordinary duties, may appoint some other legally qualified Medical Practitioner, having the qualification required for the Office of Medical Officer of Health of the District to make such examination and give such certificate as aforesaid." This section is amended by Sect. 4 of the 1891 Act, which latter stipulates that the annual value of each separate dwelling within the house " shall not amount to £20." Other amendments I do not purpose dealing with in this Report. In conclusion, as pointed out to your Vestry in my Annual Report for 1894, " no definition is given of what is meant by the somewhat vague and elastic expression " " suitable accommodation," and " sanitary requirements," the interpretation of these phrases being left to the judgment of the individual Medical Officer of Health. Health Department, Vestry Hall, St. George's, Southwark, 30th November, 1896. Dear Sir, Mr. Vivian, Surveyor of Taxes, has referred me to you for answers to the following questions:- (1) The meaning of the words in the certificate issued by your Authority to the effect that a house " is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the persons inhabiting it," and that "due provision is made for their sanitary requirments." Am I to interpret this sentence as denoting a perfect state of house sanitation or at least a much higher standard than that aimed at by the Statutory Bye-laws, and Regulations in force within this District. (2) Is it intended that new and old houses alike must reach the same, or a different standard of excellence, before a certificate can be granted. ('6) Does the certificate once signed remain good for an indefinite or merely for a limited period. If the latter, what is the length of time fixed. (4) Before considering any application for a certificate may I demand evidence from the Surveyor of Taxes to the effect that the dwelling in question is such a one in regard to annual value and construction as properly comes within the Acts. (5) Is it necessary for the M.O.H. himself to examine personally any house in respect of which a certificate is requested, or can such certificate be given on the report of a Sanitary Inspector to the M.O.H. (6) Can a mandamus or other legal process be issued against a M.O.H. for refusal to sign a certificate such as is at present sent out by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue. If such be the case, provided the Medical Officer act in a bond fide manner may he be subjected to any personal liability attending such action, and if so by whom will the expenses incurred be borne or repaid. This question has been suggested to me by an actual threat of proceedings. (7) Will your Authority accept the subjoined Certificate and Form of Sanitary Inspector's Report to M.O.H. as according with the provisions of the Customs and 16 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Inland Revenue Acts. If not in order kindly state what amendment or amendments are necessary.

Sir, With reference to your letter of the 30th November last, I am directed by the Board of Inland Revenue to state that they can only inform you that they would be prepared to receive a Certificate in the form proposed by you. in any case where relief from the Inhabited House Duty is sought under the provisions of Section 26 (2) of the Act 53 and 54 Vic., c. 8, as amended by Section 4 of the Act 54 and 55 Vic., c. 25. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) T. N. CRAFER, Secretary. F. J. Waldo, Esq., M.D. The whole of the foregoing facts and correspondence was laid before the Health Committee, who refused to sanction the signature of the District Inspectors to the printed form provided for that purpose. From this decision I am in doubt as to whether the Committee expect me to examine drains, and do the necessary work myself, or whether I am to employ the Inspectors, but, at the same time, to refrain from asking them to furnish me with the formal evidence of a signed report as to the discharge of duties clearly within their province and outside my own. Alcohol. The drink problem nowhere presses for solution with more urgency than in a poor and crowded district such as St. George's, Southwark. It seems likely, judging from the general trend of public opinion, that the question of environment has much to do with the alcoholic craving of the individual. At any rate the wealthier and healthier classes of society consume far less alcohol than the less well to do. Mortuary and Coroner's Court: Two hundred and twelve bodies were removed to the parish mortuary during the year 1896, as against 207 in 1895, 190 in 1894, 236 in 1893, and 191 in 1892. 19 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. This number includes bodies brought from the St. George's Workhouse. Post-mortem examinations and inquests were held in 88 cases, and inquests alone in 32 cases. During 1896 15 young children were suffocated whilst lying in bed with their parents, as against 16 in 1895. This lamentable Joss of life might have been prevented had these unfortunate children slept in cots. The following list shows the particular morning upon which the above-mentioned 15 infants were found suffocated in bed:— Sunday Mornings 4 Monday ,, 2 Tuesday „ 0 Wednesday „ 2 Thursday „ 3 Friday ,, 1 Saturday „ 3 15 Five bodies of those who have died from infectious diseases have been deposited in the Chamber set apart for such purpose. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1891. 338 Workshops have been registered by your Authority since January, 1892, when the Act first came into operation. Of this number 96 have been added during the past year. In many of these cases, I am glad to say, that registration has led to either the abatement or the removal of nuisance such as filth, overcrowding, and bad ventilation. Special attention has been given to the water-closets, both as to sufficiency and to a separate accommodation for the sexes. The late Home Secretary's Order, under Section 27 (1) of the Act, first took effect on the 20th November, 1892. It was made in the interests of the public and of those employed in " domestic workshops." The Order remains only partly enforced in this parish, and will continue so unless some means be devised to lighten the more pressing duties of the Sanitary Inspectors. In my Reports for 1893, 1894 and 1895, I said, that in my opinion, a special inspector would be required to carry the Order out thoroughly in your district. This view of the question I would again respectfully urge upon the attention of your Vestry. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1895. This important measure introduced by the late Home Secretary, Mr. Asquith, came into force on the 1st day of January, 1896. It forms a considerable advance on previous legislation both in raising the standard of industrial environment, and in giving increased powers to the Authorities. The chief points may be briefly touched upon. First and foremost, it provides that a factory or workshop shall be deemed overcrowded if there be less than 250 feet 0f cubic space to each person during the hours of work, and of 400 cubic feet during overtime. It authorises a magistrate, on complaint of an Inspector, and being satisfied that a factory or workshop is in a dangerous or injurious condition, to prohibit the place from being used until such works as are necessary to remove the danger have been 20 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. executed. Adequate penalties are provided against the employment of persons in work injurious to health, or for allowing wearing apparel to be made up, cleaned, or repaired in places where there is scarlet fever or small-pox. It also directs that a full notification and register of deaths from accident be kept by owners or occupiers, and that the Factory Inspector attend the subsequent inquest, while the Homo Secretary is furnished with powers for additional investigation if he deem fit. A number of fresh regulations have been passed with regard to laundries, which are now, for the first time, brought under the control of the Inspectors. Numerous provisions have been made with a view to enforcing the duties of employers in the observance of sanitation, of the fencing of machines, of the affixing of notices, and of the general carrying out of their responsibilities under the Act. It is worthy of special note, that in the case of tenement factories the owner is made responsible in place of the occupier. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.

Houses and Tenements 2 Inhabitants 9 During the years 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895, and 1896, applications have been made for Closing Orders in the case of 261 houses and tenements unfit for human habitation. These dwellings have sheltered upwards of 1,500 persons, and I think some steps should be taken to re-house those whose occupations necessitate their living in or near the district. To effect this object, the necessary powers are given the Vestry under part III. of the Act. I would again respectfully commend the serious attention of your Sanitary Authority toward the equitable solution of this pressing problem. Section 30 of the Act states that "It shall be the duty of the Medical Officer of Health of every district to represent to the Local Authority of that district any dwelling-house which appears to him to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation." In compliance with this direction I have from time to time advised your Vestry (the Authority under the Act) to apply for Closing Orders with respect to some of the worst class of slum-property in Southwark. Moreover, after closure for a term of certain of these houses, your Vestry have made and carried into effect orders for demolition. 21 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. Certain unwholesome dwellings which can be put into an habitable condition have been reported to your Health Committee. Such houses have been closed pending alterations—under the provisions of the Public Health Act. It should, however, be clearly understood that those houses which can be dealt with only by demolition, if a due regard be paid to health considerations, are usually taken under the Housing Act. If closed by virtue of the less stringent Health Act, there is nothing to prevent their remaining a standing danger, for an indefinite period, to the health of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwellings, and to the public generally.

During the year 1896 one of the yards of Messrs. Harrison, Barber & Co., namely that in Westcott Street, was closed. In the course of the summer some information came to the Sanitary Department that horses were being slaughtered on unlicensed premises at 107 Old Kent Road. The premises, which were used as stables, were accordingly placed under careful observation by Mr. Ralph. In the upshot, evidence was obtained and a summons taken out by the Vestry against the owner of the premises. The magistrate dismissed the case on the technical ground that the slaughtering took place in a yard held in common by the accused and by other occupants, therefore the summons was not good at law, and was dismissed without costs. It may be added that the County Council has since prosecuted the defendants in the above case for a similar offence, and obtained a conviction. The fine and costs amounted to £165. 22 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. List of Cow-houses licensed by the London County Council, in October, 1896. Name. Situation. No. of Cows.

Bakehouses under the New (1895) Act. The general provisions of the Act enforces 400 cubic feet of air space for each workman engaged in a retail bakehouse. They also appear to allow the Local Authorities to proceed against the owner, as well as the occupier, for certain offences committed in any such bakehouse. The special requirements of the Act, as regards retail bakehouses, are as follows :— "Sect. 27.—(1) Sections 34 and 35 of the principal Act shall apply to every bakehouse, and so much of those Sections as limits the operation thereof to cities, towns, and places, having a population of more than five thousand persons shall be repealed." (2) In Section 15 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, the words " which was not so let or occupied before the first day of June, 1883," shall be repealed. (3) "A place under ground shall not be used as a bakehouse, unless it is so used at the commencement of this Act, and if any place is so used in contravention of this Act it shall be deemed to be a workshop not kept in conformity with the principal Act." The gist of Sections 34 and 35 of the 1878 Act, and Sections 15 and 16 of the 1883 Act, referred to in the above quotation, may be found under " Regulations for Bakehouses " in the Appendix. It will be seen, after 30 years of tentative legislation, Government has recognised the fact that the underground bakehouses should cease to exist. The prohibition of any underground work-place used afresh as a bakery after the 1st January, 1896, may be reasonably regarded as a first step towards their entire removal. The Notification of Infectious Diseases. Certain infectious diseases have been made notifiable in London since the passing of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. They comprise:—small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, the disease known as scarlatina, or scarlet fever, and the fevers known by any of the following names:— typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued or puerperal. In 1896, the sum in fees paid to medical practitioners for notifying 683 infectious cases in St. George's amounted to £73 16s. 6d. This amount, paid in the first instance by your Vestry, is recouped by the Asylums Board, and charged to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. 43 per cent, of the total number of cases notified in the parish during 1896 were removed to the Asylums Board and other hospitals. During 1892, 67 per cent., in 1893, 34 per cent., in 1894, 44 per cent., and in 1895. 46 per cent. of such cases were treated in these institutions. The decrease of admissions during 1893, 1894, 1895, and 1896, was due to the overcrowded state of the hospitals. My experience of the past year shows that there is urgent need for further hospital accommodation for infectious diseases. It is important to bear in mind that prompt isolation alone can obviate the danger resulting from the detention of infectious patients in so poor and densely packed a district as St. George's. Room Disinfection. At the close of the year a good deal of attention was directed by your Vestry to the subject of room disinfection. A sub-committee of the Health Committee was appointed " to make a thorough investigation of the methods employed by the Sanitary 24 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Department, and the instructions given by the Medical Officer of Health in reference thereto." On the 27th November, 1896, a report was issued as the result of that inquiry. It contained a number of specific complaints and recommendations, which were fully discussed by myself in a Report (December 15th, 1896), and a supplementary Report (January 12th, 1897). The whole question was then further reported upon by a Committee of the Vestry (5th February, 1897). Although the latter documents do not strictly fall within the year 1896, yet it would be impossible to present a proper version of the matter without giving all the documents in their continuity. 1 have therefore inserted in the appendix the whole of the above-mentioned reports, together with a communication from the Local Government Board. A perusal of these reports can hardly fail to call the attention of the reader to certain points 1. The intelligent interest, both public and local, shown in health matters, and especially on such a technical point as the disinfection of rooms. 2. The fact that the present system of administration is imperfect. 3. That among other causes the imperfection may be traced to the following:— (a) Want of a refuge house. (b) Want of a larger staff of disinfectors. (c) Want of a special inspector to deal with infectious diseases. (d) Want of promptitude of the Asylums Board in removal of cases. In conclusion, I may add my hope that the interest recently shown in the important question of room disinfection in this poor and ci'owded parish may not be allowed to wane before the matter is placed on a sound and satisfactory footing. At the request of the Vestry I have drawn up a provisional code of rules for the guidance of the disinfectors (see appendix to Supplementary Report). It should be pointed out, however, that the suggested code has not been adopted by the Vestry. House to House Inspection. The first section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, directs that a house to house inspection shall be made by the Local Authority. Such a visitation as that intended by the framers of the Act was, for the first time in the history of this Parish, commenced in 1894. During 1896 1665 house to house inspections have been made, as against 1613 in 1895, and the results of such visits have been entered into the registers kept for the purpose. To repeat the words made use of for the last two years, I may, perhaps, be allowed to add my opinion that this system of house to house inspection is likely to do more towards raising the general health standard of your district than any single step yet taken by your Vestry. Houses Let in Lodgings. An attempt has been made, during the year under report, to enforce the new ByeLaws made in compliance with the Public Health Act, with respect to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. So far, 228 dwelling houses, inhabited by the poorest classes, have been registered in conformity with the Bye-laws. 25 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1896. In this Parish, houses built on the so-called "model'' or block system, and accommodating upwards of 12,800 inmates, at present escape the salutary provisions of the new bye-laws. These dwellings, often inhabited by the uneducated and unruly poor, are for the most part badly supervised. I would beg once more to enter my protest that such "models " should be included, in the interests of the public health, within the purview of the new tenement bye-laws. Such a reform could be accomplished by means of an amendment of the Public Health Act. By the appointment of a Female Sanitary Inspector the Vestry hope to secure the better carrying out of the bye-laws dealing with lodgings. Duties and Conditions of Appointment of Female Sanitary Inspector. DUTIES. 1.—To attend at the Vestry Hall from 9.30 to 10.30 a.m., and from 4 to 4.30 p.m., each day except Saturday, when the hours shall be from 9.30 to 10.30 a.m., anil from 12.30 to 1 p.m. 2.—To submit all communications from Owners of Property, Agents, and others to the Chief Inspector. 3.—When instructed by the Medical Officer of Health, to make Special Reports of any premises that he may consider necessary. 4.—To make periodical inspections of and submit reports to the Vestry on all houses and premises registered under the Bye-laws as to houses let in Lodgings and occupied by members of more than one family, and to prepare and serve all such notices connected therewith as she may be required. 5.—To make inspections from time to time of all workshops and work-places in which females are employed, including premises in which outworkers exercise their calling, to make reports thereon, and to prepare and serve all such notices connected therewith as she may be required. 6.—To report to the Chief Inspector any matters of a general sanitary character which she may discover, and which require attention. 7.—To attend all meetings of the Public Health and Sewers Committee, and the Vestry, whenever so required. 8.—To submit to the Chief Inspector reports of all eases in which Police Court proceedings are necessary, and to act under his instructions in all such matters. 9.—Generally to act under the directions of the Medical Officer of Health, and to make Keports in such form and keep such books as he may direct.

(Signed) J. A. JOHNSON, Vestry Hall, Vestry Clerk. 81, Borough Road, S.E. Falcon Court and Neighbourhood. I am glad to be able to report that in the near future there is every likelihood that the present area of Falcon Court and its neighbourhood will be swept away, and that this unwholesome area will be wholly or partially replaced by an open air space. A Local Government Board Inquiry has been made, and the report is presumably now under official consideration. The sanitary aspects of the scheme were discussed in my evidence laid before the Inspector last summer. Those interested in this aspect of the affair will find a full report at page 58 of the Appendix. In concluding this report, I may once again congratulate your Vestry on another year of progress in health matters. There has been a fall of .8 per 1,000 in the death-rate which has reached a lower point than any on record during the past half century. It is gratifying to be able to point to a solid and practical result of this kind, in view of the ever-increasing load of work and responsibility which is cast upon Local Authorities and their Medical Officer of Health. So long as I am honoured with the confidence of your Vestry it will be my earnest endeavour to carry out the duties of the important office with which I have been entrusted, with all necessary care and vigilance. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, F. J. WALDO, 1, Plowden Buildings, Temple. Medical Officer of Health. May, 1897. 27 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. APPENDIX. REGINA v. SLADE and THE VESTRY OF ST. GEORGE, SOUTHWARK. This case, in which the Salvation Army asked that a rule nisi might he upheld, came before the Lord Chief Justice of England and Mr. Justice Wright in the High Court of Justice on the 1st of May, 1896, and was decided yesterday (4th May) in favour of your Vestry. Mr. Macmorran, Q.C. and Mr. F. Low appeared for the Vestry, Mr. Willis, Q.C. and Mr. Munroe for the Salvation Army, whilst Mr. Sutton represented Mr. Slade the learned magistrate. The Vestry will remember the case arose out of an order, made last year by Mr. Slade prohibiting any future over-crowding in the Blackfriars Shelter. This order was given as a result of a prosecution by your Vestry, the hearing of which extended over a period of four months, during which time the magistrate himself inspected the Shelter. On the day the order was made it is worthy of note that Counsel for "General " Booth declared that "Whatever the magistrate's decision might be the Salvationists would abide by it loyally." Instead, however, of observing this course, the Salvation Army proceeded to raise certain "puerile objections" of a highly technical kind, against the wording of the order. In giving judgment against Mr. Booth, the Lord Chief Justice said:—"I think this rule ought to be discharged.'' The order of the magistrate was made on the 21st November, 1895. The order states that proof had been given that the nuisance complained of existed " at the said premises, and the same is caused by the act, default, or sufferance " of the person charged, and the Magistrate then prohibited the recurrence of the nuisance. The rule for a certiorari was obtained upon the grounds :— (1) "That 'house' is not mentioned in the notice, summons, or order, and premises are not a house." (2) "That the persons proved to have been at the premises in question were not "inmates" thereof within the meaning of the Act." The notice of the 21st July, 1895, to the chief officer in charge of the Salvation Army shelter states that the Sanitary Authority is satisfied of the existence of a nuisance at the premises situate at 115a, Blackfriars Road, aforesaid; that the said premises, or certain parts thereof, are so overcrowded as to be injurious or dangerous to the health of the inmates. It is not disputed that if, after the word "premises," the words " being a dwelling house " had been inserted the notice would be good. The question is whether the omission of these words makes it bad. I am of opinion it does not. The premises are mentioned by words of description. They are called a shelter. The language is applicable to a dwelling house, and not to a factory. The section which is material is Sect. 2, Sub-Sect. (1), Sub-Clause (e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Further provision is made by Sub-Sect. 2 (11). 28 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward. The test to be applied is whether in the case of a dwelling-house used also as a factory the overcrowding is injurious to the health of those employed therein. I think that the notice in substance conveys that the nuisance complained of is the overcrowding of a dwelling house, No. 115a Blackfriars Road. The order follows the Summons. I think it would be exceedingly regrettable if puerile objections of this sort were to be allowed to take effect. I also think that the magistrate would have been at liberty to amend by adding the words "dwelling-house.'' There is no substance in the objection. Looking to the whole circumstances, the Court thinks that the justice of the case will be met by discharging the rule, and (on the assumption) that the Shelter in question is a philanthropic institution, not carried on for gain, each side will have to pay its own costs. Mr. Justice Wright concurred. In conclusion, it is to be hoped that the action of your Vestry will soon be the means of bringing Salvation Army and other common night shelters of a similar nature within the control of the Common Lodging Houses' Act. Night Shelters, and What we Pay for Them.* Night shelters may be defined as places provided for poor persons to pass the night under a roof, either free of cost or upon payment of a small fee. In this brief article we propose to deal only with such places belonging to the Salvation Army, and to take our illustration from the Blackfriars Shelter, situated in the Metropolitan Parish of St. George the Martyr, and in the Union of St. Saviour Southwark. The position of this particular Shelter has been defined after a series of legal proceedings. The High Court decided that it did not come under the Common Lodging Houses Act, nor within the Public Health Act as regards disinfection. The Shelter, therefore, is less under the control of the Sanitary Authority than an ordinary dwellinghouse, inasmuch as disinfection can be enforced in the latter. As to overcrowding, the Sanitary Authority has a right of entry only between six in the morning and nine at night, that is to say, when the place is empty. In a word, the Shelter is practically, outside sanitary control. This fact has been emphasised by its having been the startingpoint of two outbreaks of small-pox, and by a recent police-court prosecution, when 1,031 inmates were proved to have been in a space which the magistrate said would be overcrowded by 551. The Blackfriars Shelter offers sitting-room for one penny per night, and rough sleeping accommodation for twopence or threepence. Nominally, its doors are open free of charge to the absolutely destitute, but in practice everyone has to pay. The Shelter is founded with money subscribed by the outside public. That it makes a handsome profit out of the pence of the poor has never been seriously disputed. At first sight its work appears to relieve the poor-law and to lessen the burden upon the poverty-stricken district of St. Saviour. Further inquiry, however, will show that this so-called philanthropic enterprise entails a heavy indirect tax upon the ratepayers, first, of the district in which it lies, and secondly, of the metropolis generally. To put the matter briefly, so far as St. Saviour's is concerned the Shelter attracts thither a flock of outside vagrants, an importation which concerns all who contribute to the rates. It will be well to state here how a pauper becomes entitled to poor-law maintenance. The Union to which he is chargeable is known as his place of settlement. It may be "original," that it to say, determined by the accident of birth, or " acquired " in any of the following ways:— * Paper read in the Public Health Section, Annual Meeting of the British Medical Association, Carlisle, July, 1896, by Drs. Waldo and Walsh. 29 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. One night's residence within a Union gives a person the right to throw himself upon the rates as a pauper. Three years' unbroken residence constitutes an acquired settlement, which takes precedence of a birth settlement. Twelve months' undisturbed residence constitutes an "irremovability." That is to say, the pauper can throw himself upon the rates, but he forfeits that right by a single night's residence away from the parish, when he reverts to his original union of settlement. If thrown upon the rates during temporary sickness, a pauper cannot be removed, no matter what his settlement. The money spent in trying to establish a pauper's settlement is often considerable. The attempt may involve much correspondence, special journeys, and legal proceedings, which may be carried from one court to another, even to the Lords. So great is the cost and delay in disputed cases that the responsibility is not infrequently accepted by the Guardians without further ado. Let us suppose a vagrant to have wandered up to London. He hears that for a penny he can sleep for the night in the Blackfriars Shelter, secure from the police. He makes for the place, and, perhaps, after sleeping there once he cannot find the penny for another night, and thereupon throws himself upon the St. Saviour's Union as a pauper. Unless the Guardians can find out his original union of settlement, they are thenceforth saddled with his maintenance. As an ablebodied man, he is kept in the House ; if ill, he has to be tended in an infirmary; if insane, he is put in an asylum ; if he die, he must be buried ; all at the expense of the ratepayers. So far as St. Saviour's Union is concerned, any and all of these responsibilities have been again and again thrust upon its Poor Law Authorities as the result of one or more nights spent by vagrants in the Blackfriars Shelter. Some idea of what the ratepayers of St. Saviour's pay for the Blackfriars Shelter, may be gathered from an analysis of admissions from the latter to local Poor-law institutions during the year 1895. Mr. Glover, a Relieving Officer in the Union, has furnished us with an able, exhaustive, and painstaking report upon this matter. During 1895, 691 paupers came direct from the Blackfriars Shelter to the Union of St. Saviour's, of which number 82 were casual. The cost to the Guardians of such paupers who had not a settlement in the Union, was £622 17s. 7d. These figures are computed at the rate of ninepence per head per day in the Workhouse; one shilling per day in a Poor Law infirmary ; and ten shillings per week in an asylum. The sum mentioned does not include the heavy expense of inquiries into settlements, of transferring paupers to there original unions, and of other miscellaneous items. In addition to this charge for aliens, the cost of paupers from the Shelter who had either a birth or an acquired settlement in the parish was £214 19s. 1d. Some of these latter settlements, it should be noted were actually acquired by a continuous residence of over three years passed night after night in the Shelter. Adding these two sums together, we find that the direct cost to the Union for paupers who came from the Shelter during 1895 was £837 16s. 8d. This sum does not include the cost of 82 casuals, who were all detained for two nights and one day. Some of the alien paupers would doubtless have drifted to St. Saviour's under any circumstances. On the other hand it seems fair to assume that the greater number of them were attracted thither by the existence of the Salvation Army Shelter. It must be borne in mind that the sum of £837 16s. 8d. represents a portion only of the actual outlay, for besides the heavy indirect expenses already mentioned, a number of these persons are still in the Workhouse. Those who are permanently disabled by physical 30 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. or mental weakness will have to be clothed, housed, and fed for the rest of their lives by the Union of St. Saviour's. The total cost is lessened to some extent by the contribution of the London County Council in aid of the local poor fund. The sum thus contributed is, in point of fact, a money payment on the part of the Metropolis generally towards the maintenance of the disabled folk attracted to London by the Blackfriars Shelter. On the whole, the direct and indirect cost of this philanthropy to the ratepayers of St. Saviour's may probably be estimated at several thousands of pounds per annum. Whatever the amount, if the present system be maintained, it will go on increasing year by year, as the permanently disabled pauper accumulate in the in firmaries and asylums of the Union. Supposing there were no shelter in St. Saviour's then the tramps coming up from the country would be distributed pretty equally throughout the various Metropolitan casual wards. For obvious reasons the Salvation Army chooses a poor district like Blackfriars for night shelters. It follows, then, that the poorest Metropolitan Unions have to pay the cost of tending the sick and disabled destitute persons attracted thither by the Shelters. It is, moreover, equally clear that in this way the richer quarters escape their fair and proper share of the burden. The Salvation Army Shelters appear to be carried on with funds directly and indirectly obtained from three sources: 1. Charitable donations. 2. The pence of the poor. 3. The contributions of the ratepayers, both local and metropolitan. The facts presented in this paper are the result of an economic analysis of a so-called philanthropic scheme, the motives of which we do not for a moment call in question. The scheme certainly does not stand the ordeal of a logical examination. The cost of night shelter to the ratepayers, then, if we may argue from the case of Blackfriars, is considerable. Surely, on the ground of the money expenditure alone, the District Sanitary Boards should have a larger measure of control over institutions of this kind. If this were the case the Medical Officer of Health would be better able to cope with epidemic outbreaks in the shelters. The history of small-pox in Southwark. during the past few years shows that the Blackfriars Shelter has played an active part in spreading the disease, not only in the neighbourhood, but also throughout London. This item is a further indirect burden thrown by the Shelters upon the metropolitan ratepayers, who have to maintain the infectious fever hospitals. Our main conclusion is that the Salvation Army Shelters attract a poor, shiftless, and often disabled class of the community to the most poverty-stricken districts of London, which are subsequently saddled with the cost of this ill-considered philanthropy. So far as we can judge, the best way out of the difficulty would be to bring all such night refuges under the Common Lodging-Houses Act. In this way not only the economic, but the sanitary interests of ratepayers would be to some extent safeguarded. Report of an Outbreak of Scarlet Fever in a Hospital within the District. I have to report ten cases of scarlet fever, notified to me within the past fortnight as having taken the disease and sickened in a hospital within your district. This outbreak may, probably, be traced to the accidental presence in the hospital of an infected parishioner, an infant whose death, which occurred within a few hours of entry, was certified as due to congenital cardiac disease and diarrhœa. Of the ten notifications mentioned, two only—both of nurses— were accepted by the officials at the Central Office of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The remaining eight notifications were refused by the Board; and, after personal application, I was advised to see the Resident Medical Official of the Hospital in question, and suggest to him the desirability of complying with the strict letter of the law by sending the notifications to the Medical Officers of Health for the various 31 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1896. districts from whence the patients originally came. This I did, with the result that my suggestion was immediately acted upon. The provisions of the Health Act as regards notification, are, I think, so far as they go good, but they do not go far enough. For example, no provision whatever is made for the notification of infectious diseases originating with patients in hospitals to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the particular hospital may happen to be situated. Such an omission constitutes, in my opinion, a serious flaw in the Act. On the other hand, again, the absurdity of the situation is accentuated when the fact is noted that the Medical Officer of such a hospital is obliged to notify patients who have become infected to the Medical Officer of Health for the district, often a country one, whence the patient originally came may be weeks or months before. By way of illustration, as matters at present stand, had the doctor chosen merely to notify the earlier cases to the Medical Officers of the place (scattered over various parts) from which the patients were brought to the hospital, the outbreak might easily have reached serious dimensions. In the instance, however, of the particular outbreak under report direct notification of the earlier cases has already led to the prompt and thorough disinfection of two wards, together with other precautionary measures directed towards the stamping out of a highly infectious and dangerous malady. The practical lesson to be learnt from the outbreak is the need of an amendment of Sect. 55-(l) (6) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, making notification of dangerous infectious disease compulsory, not only to the Medical Officer of Health of the district from whence a hospital patient is drawn, but also to the Medical Officer of Health of the Parish in which the hospital is situated. This view of the case I would earnestly urge upon your Vestry in order that the attention of the Local Government Board and of our legislators may be directed to an omission that constitutes a standing danger to the public health. F. J. WALDO, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, St. George's. 16th June; 1896. Report of an Outbreak of Diphtheria in Cornbury Street, Old Kent Road. In accordance with a request from your Vestry I beg to make the following report on an outbreak of Diphtheria in that portion of your district known as Cornbury Street, Old Kent Road. The first case was notified on the 14th of July, and the last on the 8th of October. There were fourteen cases in all of which number live proved fatal. Seven were treated in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals and seven at their own homes. With the exception of two, all those attacked were under the age of ten years. The youngest was one year two months, the oldest forty-one, and the average nine years two months. Seven were males and seven females. Cornbury Street is a narrow cul de sac, 160 yards long, running at right angles to the Old Kent Road. It consists of forty-seven two-storied houses, and is inhabited by carmen, watermen, and others of the labouring class. Four of these houses branch off in a kind of court. The houses may be divided according to the number of rooms into two, three and four rooms. In two cases there are six rooms. The two-roomed houses, three in number, consist of a single room opening from the street and connected by a 32 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. staircase with an upper bedroom. The three-roomed houses, two in number, have one downstair and two upstair rooms. The four-roomed houses, forty in number, -have each a front door opening by a passage into kichen at back and living room in front. An open staircase from the kitchen leads directly to two upstair rooms. Drainage.— The W.C.'s are in all cases, except one, situated in back yards and are atmospherically disconnected from the houses. The exception is No. 30, in which the W.C. opens directly into the single kitchen on the ground floor. For the most part the closet pans are of the hopper pattern furnished with a separate flushing cistern. In eleven cases there were defects found in the W.C.'s. Twenty-nine of the houses on both sides of the street communicate by means of a sewer with the main sewer in the Old Kent Road, while the remaining eighteen at the other end of the street open into what is known as the boundary sewer. The street sewers are unventilated, and the house drains are not disconnected as they should be by means of interceptor traps from the sewers. The house drains, glazed six and nine-inch pipes with four-inch T-shaped connections, are laid without cement and with open joints. Holes as big as nine inches long and four inches wide were found in these pipes. The sewers in the street are presumably laid in a similar defective fashion. In two instances combined drains pass directly underneath the houses, namely in Nos. 14 and 28. The street gullies, which open into the Old Kent Road system, are properly trapped. At the extreme end of the street, however, a gully opens into the boundary sewer. Up to the 29th September last, when alterations were made, the condition of this gully was a cause of constant annoyance. It was untrapped and frequently choked so that the adjoining street was flooded with surface water and filth, aud for a long time past the inhabitants had complained of intolerable stenches. There appears to be a sufficient fall in that part of the system connected with the Old Kent Road drainage, but it should be mentioned that both the latter and the boundary system are ventilated. It may be convenient here to summarize the state of drainage in Cornbury Street. The main facts of this somewhat complicated system are:— 1.—The W.C.'s are, with one exception, disconnected from houses, and are of fairly good type as regards construction and flushing. 2.—The whole of the pipes, from closet-pan to street sewers, are grossly defective. 3.—In two cases these defective pipes pass directly under houses. 4.—The street sewers are without ventilation and there are no intercepting traps, and up till recently one of the street gullies has been untrapped and frequently choked. Water Supply is from the Southwark and Vauxhall Company's mains. The service, so far as I can learn, is fairly though not invariably constant. In most of the houses it is obtained direct from taps connected with the rising main. In eight of the houses, numbers 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22, the drinking water is stored in cisterns situated in the back yards, and unfurnished with overflow pipes. The taps from the main as well as from the cisterns are in the yards, and both discharge over trapped gullies. Summary—Water Supply.—The chief risk of contamination arises from intermission of supply which takes place from time to time. The house-drains run from 1½ to 3 feet below the water supply pipes. The storage cisterns are additional dangers owing to their never being kept in practice in a cleanly condition. General Structural Condition.—The houses are built of brick roofed with slates generally water tight. The houses are from fifty to sixty years old, and there is no attempt at impermeable flooring. In the absence of cellars the ground flooring is laid 33 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1896. on joists separated by a few inches from the underlying soil, and there is no provision for ground ventilation. The general dampness of foundations is shown by discolouration of white-wash and peeling off of paper especially in cupboards. The back yards and forecourts are many of them unpaved, while others are imperfectly paved with concrete. In many of them fowls, pigeons, and rabbits are kept. At the backs of that side of the street which includes numbers 37 to 49 runs a strip of vacant ground some 3 feet wide and 95 feet long which, until recently was a general dumping ground for rubbish often of an offensive nature. The dust-bins are situated in the backyards; all of them are made of wood and many are without covers. General Sanitary Conclusions.—From a sanitary point of view the environment of dwellers in Cornbury Street can in no sense be regarded as satisfactory. The fundamental defect is the drainage system which is so constructed as to permeate the soil, to poison the air—both outside and inside the dwellings—and to risk the pollution of the water-supply. The connection between this undesirable state of affairs and the outbreak which forms the subject of the present inquiry will be subsequently alluded to. History of the Outbreak.—On the 14th of July a girl, aged five, of 41, Cornbury Street, was notified to be suffering from diphtheria. Owing to a skin affection she had not attended school for six months previously. She was supplied with milk from a dairy situated in Oornbury Street. The medical man in attendance was unable to trace the source of the infection. He was inclined, however, quoting his own words "to believe in contagion from school, or perhaps from some case in the neighbourhood but not in the street." This girl died in the upper front room, which was fumigated with sulphur and all clothes and bedding disinfected. On the 1st August another child, a girl aged one year ten months, died in the upper front room from what was certified as diarrhoea. On the 5th August, another child a boy aged six, was notified. He was treated in the lower front room where he died, and the mother was left childless. From various sources, including that of the doctor, I gather that the neighbours flocked into the house, both when the children were lying ill and on the occasion of the funerals. On the same date another case, a baby of 2½ years, was notified at number 21, eleven houses off on the same side of the street. The mother of this child had, just previous to its attack, been cleaning up at number 41. It seems reasonable to suppose that cases number 2 and 3 contracted the disease from the original case. Had any other common source of infection been at work it is tolerably certain that more cases would have occurred in the street. On the 17th August, a young man of 20, a lodger, was notified from number 41, the house where the outbreak began. It is more than suggestive that this young man occupied the lower front room in which case number two was nursed and died. The contents of the room had been carried away and disinfected, and the room fumigated with sulphur. The conduct of this young man, as reported to me from various quarters, shows the recklessness with which some sections of the public treat the risks of spreading the infection of diphtheria. It is hardly necessary to enter into a detailed history of the rest of the outbreak. Suffice it to say that eight fresh cases were notified at intervals of from two to eleven days up to the 16th of September. After a break of a fortnight, another case was reported, and nine days later the last of the fourteen cases occurred. Three of these cases were at number 41, three at 37, two at number 36, and the rest were scattered about on both sides of the street. Dealing next with common general condition we find :— (a) School.-There is no reason for attributing this strictly limited and local outbreak to the influence of any particular school or schools. Had any institution in the neighbourhood been the active source of contagion it is obvious that many more cases would have been reported in the neighbourhood. (b) Milk.—The supply was obtained from various sources, notably from a dairy 34 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. in the street. Most of the houses dealt with that particular milk vendor, so that any specific infection from that source would have caused a more general outbreak in the street. (c) Water.—By a similar line of reasoning water may be excluded. (d) Drainage.—The outbreak cannot be traced to defective drainage. Cornbury Street is sewered by two independent systems. Nine cases occurred in houses connected with the boundary sewer and five in those connected with the Old Kent Road sewer. At the same time it is probable that bad drainage together with dampness and other unwholesome surroundings has a considerable indirect influence in predisposing to attacks of diphtheria. For my own part I do not believe that the poison of diphtheria is likely to be conveyed by drains. Further it is a well known fact that sewer gas in houses is a fruitiul cause of sore-throats. It is equally well known that the diphtheria bacillus fastens on the lining membrane of any inflamed or otherwise damaged throat. In this way it seems probable that persons dwelling in an unwholesome environment like that of Cornbury Street will be specially prone to an invasion of diphtheria if once brought into this neighbourhood. (e) Social Influences.—This street a blind alley, with its closely-packed population forms a sort of colony where a good deal of social intimacy prevails. During the earlier stages of the outbreak I learn that patients were visited freely by neighbours, including children, and that funerals became the subject of special gatherings in the houses of the mourners. It is hardly necessary to point out how such conditions would favour the spread of infection. General Conclusion as to Cause — By a process of exclusion 1 am led to believe that the epidemic in Cornbury Street was due to direct infection from the original case at number 41 which was in turn infected by some outside source. That being the case it will be necessary to inquire as to the measures for staying the outbreak, and why, in spite of those measures, the disease spread to thirteen individuals and lasted over a course of several months. The chief measures by which diphtheria is to be controlled from a Public Health point of view are prompt isolation and thorough disinfection. Isolation, however, cannot be effected until the disease is recognised; and the question of early diagnosis becomes of first importance. Without attempting to deal exhaustively with these three points a few words may be said upon each in turn. Early Diagnosis.—It is well known to medical men that some cases of diphtheria are extremely difficult to detect. The diagnosis can only be made after a period of waiting. Moreover, it seems probable that a certain number of cases are never detected at ail. As an illustration of this difficulty I have it from a Doctor that four of his patients in Cornbury Street, although suffering from suspicious sore throats, remained unnotified owing to the clinical evidence being too weak in his judgment to support the theory of diphtheria, lience, it is of the utmost importance to be able to decide at once whether a sore-throat is or is not of a diphtheritic nature. This can now be done in a bacteriological laboratory. In Marylebone, for instance, every medical man is provided with a small cardboard box containinig two sterilised test-tubes. One of these tubes is for membrane, if it can be obtained, and the other is furnished with a sterilised swab of wool wound round a wire. The medical attendant touches the throat with the wool and sends it off to the Medical Officer of Health, who is able to send back within twenty-four hours a definite report as to the existence of the disease. The cost of the whole examination of each case amounts to two shillings and sevenpence. It should be clearly understood however that the examinations are not for the purpose of revising certificates, but for dividing the cases into those which might possibly be treated at home with safety and those which require strict isolation in an infectious hospital. 35 Annual Report Medical Officer of the of Health—1896. Isolation.— Amongst a crowded and poor population such as that met with in your district, I believe the only really efficient course to be adopted is the prompt removal of almost every diphtheritic patient to the Infectious Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. No one, having any practical experience of the sick poor, can deny the impossibility of efficiently isolating—to say nothing of treating—patients living in houses like those in Cornbury Street. With regard to this question it is especially noteworthy that the two original cases at number 41 were refused admission into the Asylums Board Hospitals, and notwithstanding the fact that a daily request both by word of mouth and in writing to the Central Office of the Board, was kept up until the death of the children referred to. This failure on the part of the Asylums Board was especially prominent during the early period of the attack—that is to say, the most important stage of the outbreak. Disinfection.— Owing to the build of houses in Cornbury Street and to the fact of the families of the disinfected patients having no rooms to go to pending the disinfection of their homes, this necessary process was only carried out in an imperfect manner. I will not now discuss the question of the remedy in the shape of a Reception House against a recurrence of this evil, since I have already fully reported upon the matter. The disinfection of rooms, whether by means of sulphur dioxide or by a spray of corrosive sublimate, or ether chemical should. I believe, in all cases he followod by a free perflation of fresh air—that is to say, if thorough efficiency be desired. Many authorities go so far as to assert that it is necessary to re-paper and whitewash rooms after fumigation by sulphur. I have little hesitation in saying that such a step would be absolutely necessary should the spray system be adopted in this district, in which case the cost—a heavy one—would fall upon your Vestry. In conclusion, the Cornbury Street outbreak, in my opinion, emphasises the want of a Reception House for families of infected patients, and of a house-to-house inspection of the Parish, such as that now in progress. It also illustrates once more the shortcomings of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, in the provision of adequate infectious accommodation for this poverty-stricken district. Report of an Inquiry into Room=Disinfection as practised in St. George the Martyr. REPORT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SEWERS COMMITTEE. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. George the Martyr,— Your Committee beg to report that the question of room-disinfection has been under their consideration, and on the 9th November, 1896, they appointed a SubCommittee to make a thorough investigation of the methods employed by the Sanitary Department, and the instructions given by the Medical Officer of Health in reference thereto. The Committee now submit the results of the enquiry made by the SubCommittee, and reported to the Committee on the 27th November, 1896, as follows:— The Sub-Committee held four meetings, and investigated the present system in the light of information, placed at their disposal by the Medical Officer of Health, the Chief Inspector, the Sanitary Inspectors, and the Disinfecting Men. The course pursued may be thus described. By frequent inquiry at the house where an infectious case has occurred, the disinfecting men learn when the patient has been removed; they then take the truck and proceed to the house, remove the bedding (putting blankets, sheets, &c., into a bag), and the smaller pieces of carpet; all these articles are placed in the truck. Larger carpets and curtains, even those hanging round the bed, are never removed. When the disinfecting men return to the room, they usually close the register (if there be one), and if such an appliance does 36 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. not exist, they endeavour to close the chimney with the first thing that comes to hand —canvas, sacking, or mattress—and, if through stress of circumstance, the mattress has to be used, it is not afterwards disinfected or removed. Until the last few weeks the windows have not, as a rule, been sealed by the pasting of paper, in order to prevent the escape of the sulphur fumes. Some vessel belonging to the tenant, either pail, shovel, coal scuttle or basin is taken, the sulphur placed in it and ignited, the men then leave the room, paste paper round the door, plug the key hole. Throughout these operations—even when carrying the infected articles out of the house—the men wear their ordinary clothes, without overalls. On arrival at the Disinfecting House, the man in charge puts on overalls, takes the articles out of the bag, and places them in the machine, but he does not disinfect his overalls. When the goods have been disinfected, before opening the door of the disinfecting machine, the man removes his overalls, and in his ordinary clothes (which may have been infected by the removal of the goods from the house) takes these goods from the apparatus, and places them in a second truck to take them back to the house. As a rule the room is opened by the disinfecting men—thus, practically, no supervision has been extended over their proceedings. With regard to the overalls worn while removing the infected articles from the truck to the disinfecting apparatus, your Committee find that they are never disinfected, and that they are sent to the wash with the towels from the Public Lavatories; and, while your Committee are anxious not to attach undue importance to this point, they are constrained to observe that there has been recently a case of typhoid fever in the house of the woman who washes these articles. In justice to the men who do the disinfecting, it is necessary to say, that, as far as the Committee can learn, no written instructions have been given of late years by the Head of the Sanitary Department, serious as the state of things is, so that it cannot be said that they failed to obey orders. Your Committee find that it is the practice of the Sanitary Inspectors to call as soon as they conveniently can after the removal of the patient, to learn whether the disinfection has been carried out; for them to superintend the process has been a rare event. It has not been the invariable practice to recommend that the room should be scrubbed, or that the furniture should be washed ; this omission seems the more serious in view of the importance which modern sanitary authorities attach to soap and water As regards the value of disinfection by sulphur, your Committee is left in a position of uncertainty. On the one hand, the Medical Officer informed them, that it might be necessary to provide scales, so that the amount of sulphur consumed might be in exact proportion to the amount of cubic space in the room. On the other hand, when referring to a room in which the register had never been closed during sulphuration, and which room the tenants had opened themselves—because the men did not return to open it—the Medical Officer of Health stated, as his opinion, that the nonclosing of the register would be of little importance, provided that the room was well aired afterwards. In the course of the inquiry, it was found that there had been an outbreak of scarlet fever, with one or two cases of diphtheria, in Pardoner Street. Between July 25t.h and August 17th, twelve cases of these diseases were certified in this small street, and the number was brought up to fifteen by the end of August. Members of your Sub-Committee visited, with a view to ascertaining whether any special precautions had been taken to arrest the spread of the disease; but the result of careful inquiry on their part, disclosed the fact that the disinfection had been carried out on the lines already described. 37 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1896. They were under the impression that it was the duty of the Medical Officer of Health to visit such cases.* Although the outbreak in the district, which is very poor, was sufficiently serious for those in authority to close of their own accord—after August 23rd—the neighbouring Sunday School, the Medical Officer of Health was unable to say that he had visited the spot according to the regulation which has just been quoted. Indeed, owing to the fact that the Medical Officer of Health does not keep books, according to the requirements of the Local Government Board,f he could give us but little information or assistance in the course of the inquiry. A case in-Street, for instance, was discussed, in which a child was removed on August 10th, suffering from scarlet fever. The disinfecting officer would not say that a mattress belonging to the infected family was not used to close the chimney during sulphuration. Before this child returned from the hospital, another child was attacked; and, after lying fourteen days at home, was removed on October 16th. A third child (who has since died) succumbed to the infection, and was removed on the following day. Meanwhile, a child belonging to another family in the same house was attacked with diphtheria, and removed on October 12th. Owing to the absence of any record of his visits, the Medical Officer of Health was unable to remember whether, as alleged, he had given any certificate to the father of the child suffering from diphtheria, so that he (the father) could return to work, or whether he had visited the house at any time to look into the circumstances under which scarlet fever had, after two months, returned to the same family, with fatal results. A somewhat similar group of cases of diphtheria was discussed, in which a child was removed suffering from this disease on March 4th. The child returned in April, was re-attacked in July, and was removed on July 25th. His sister was removed on July 28th. Your Committee submit that special attention should be paid to return cases such as these. With this object, it is to be desired that the Medical Officer of Health should be so punctual in his attendance as to be accessible to the members of the staff during those hours which the Vestry has specified. In the report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1895, he gives details as to the number of rooms and their inhabitants in which, during the last three-and-a-half years, efficient fumigation had been impossible, owing to there being no family shelter. The statistics are as follows:— No. of Infected Tenements. Disease. 1 Room. 2 Rooms. 3 Rooms. Total. Scarlet Fever 162 279 89 530 Diphtheria 67 68 33 168 Erysipelas 11 12 3 26 Enteric or Typhoid Fever 18 13 — 31 Puerperal Fever 4 — — 4 Small Pox 12 7 — 19 274 379 125 778 * The Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891, Art. 18, See. (6), reads:—"On receiving information of the outbreak of any dangerous infectious disease within his district, he (that is the Medical Officer) shall visit without delay the spot where the outbreak has occurred, and inquire into the causes and circumstances of such outbreak; and, in case he is not satisfied that all due precautions are being taken, he shall advise the persons competent to act, as to the measures which may appear to him to be required to prevent the extension of the disease, and shall take such measures for the prevention of disease as he is legally authorised to take under any Statute in force in the district, or by any resolution of the Sanitary Authority." † Sec. (14) of the Order already quoted, reads :—" He (that is, the Medical Officer of Health) shall keep a book or books, to be provided by the Sanitary Authority, in which he shall make an entry of his visits, and notes of his observations and instructions thereon, and also the date and nature of applications made to him and shall produce such book or books, whenever required, to the Sanitary Authority." 38 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

At the same time, your Committee cannot but regret that the Medical Officer of Health has not made use of the power conferred on him under s. 60 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, especially in those cases whore efficient fumigation is impossible. In view of the facts which have now been set forth your Committee further recommend:— 1. That the Medical Officer of Health be requested to prepare detailed instructions for the guidance of the disinfecting officers, as to the steps which shall be taken for the sealing of windows, doors, fireplaces, &o., for the removal of beds, bedding, curtains. &c.; the wearing and disinfection of overalls ; that the work of disinfection should be under the general supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, and the more detailed supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors, and that suitable appliances should be provided to ensure efficient sulphuration. 2. That the Medical Officer of Health be requested to carry out the requirements of the Local Government Board, as regards visiting and reporting on outbreaks of infectious diseases, and endeavouring to arrest the spread of such disease, as contained in The Sanitary Officers (London) Order, 1891, Art. 18, Sec. (6) and Sec. (14):—That he be required to carry out, as regards attendance at the office, the duty specified in paragraph 1 of the List of Duties which he signed at the time of his appointment. 3. That a suitable register be provided of forms of certificate, with counterfoil, to be given to employers as to the freedom from infection of their employees, and that no other form be used. 4. That the Sanitary Inspectors be required to carry out the provisions of the Order, already quoted, Art. 19, Sec (9), which require that "he shall enter from day to day, in a book to be provided by the Sanitary Authority, particulars of his inspection, and of the action taken by him in the execution of his duties. He shall also keep a book or books, to be provided by the Sanitary Authority, so arranged as to form, as far as possible, a continuous record of the sanitary condition of each of the premises in respect of which any action has been taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or under any other Statute or Statutes, and shall keep any other systematic records that the Sanitary Authority may require." 5. That the Vestry approach the Metropolitan Asylums Board, with a request to consider whether any system could be arranged, whereby this Vestry could be informed without delay of the removal of patients. (Signed) W. NEVILLE, 27th November, 1896, Chairman. 39 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. Special Report by the Medical Officer of Health upon Room Disinfection as practised in the Parish of St. George=the=Martyr, Southwark, and commented upon by a Report from a Health Subcommittee. Ladies and Gentlemen,—As you are aware, on the 1st of December a Report was placed before the Vestry by the Public Health and Sewers Committee. The document contained the conclusions of an inquiry by a special Sub-Committee into tbe question of room disinfection as practised in your Parish. A corrected copy of that Report was placed in my hands only a few hours before its presentation to the Vestry. I therefore asked leave to defer any remarks I might have to make until 1 had given due consideration to the many important points raised in the Report. That course was the more necessary because some of the statements contained therein appeared to reflect more or less upon the administration of my Department, and because I was not furnished with a copy of the evidence upon which those statements had been based. Nor has that evidence since been forthcoming. Speaking broadly, this Report condemns the present system of room disinfection in your Parish, and with that condemnation I am bound to agree. In many points the system is clearly open to improvement, as I have often urged in my reports.0 While much has been done in the four-and-a-half years I have had the honour to act as your Medical Officer of Health, there can be no doubt that we are still far from having reached any ideal methods. The Report may be conveniently divided into (1) Criticism of present disinfecting methods and administration; (2) Suggested remedies. 1. Criticism of present methods of disinfection and administration.—One of the chief points is that I do not keep sufficient books regarding infectious cases. In 1892, when I succeeded to the office, there was one notification book in existence, and one notice form for schools. There are now in 1896, eleven books and eight notice forms. Of these 1 give a list:— Books 1 Complaint Book. 2, 3 4 Three letter books—(a) Medical Officer's, (b) Inspector's, and (c) Notification for copies of reports to Asylums Board. 5 Special School Notice Book. G Disinfecting Book. 7 Inspector's Infectious Case Book. 8 Office Notification Book. 9 Doctor's and Nurses' (Asylums Board) Notification Books. 10 Infectious Disease Register. 11 Disinfected Articles Receipt Book. Notice Forms 1 Certificate of need of disinfection and cleansing (M.O.H.'s.). 2 Notice to disinfect and cleanse. * "The Parish Premises and Apparatus used for the disinfection and destruction of infected articles;" "A proposed Reception House for the temporary shelter—whilst disinfection is pending—of the families of those suffering from infectious diseases;" and "Report on proposed Disinfecting Apparatus and Reception House, at Nos. 23 and 24, Market Street," Annual Report for 1892. " Report on Suggested Incinerator," Annual Report for 1895. 40 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. 3 Medical attendant's certificate of readiness for final disinfection. 4 M.O.H.'s certificate for employees of disinfection of premises and articles contained therein. 5 M.O.H.'s special form of application for removals to Asylums Board. G Notification form of Asylums Board. 7 Special notice to owners re infection, as required by Sec. G2 Pub. Health (Lond.) Act, 1891. 8 Public notice of precautions for preventing spread of small-pox. Personally, I quite recognise that in certain respects the keeping of more books would be an advantage, so far as it can be done without taking up time which might be more usefully spent in visiting and other duties of my office. At the same time I may say that lately I have been deprived of the services of the clerk who formerly did much of the clerical work required in the Sanitary Department. Moreover, I have often found the possession of books most undesirable when giving evidence in Court, as they may be demanded by the opposing counsel, and afford him information he would not otherwise have possessed. For this reason I have to some extent trusted to the notes of visits taken by my Sanitary Inspectors, which should invariably mention the fact when I have been present. However, the question of additional books is one for the Vestry to decide. In one passage the Sub-Committee ascribe my inability to state whether or not I had visited Pardoner Street to the absence of books. That does not represent the real state of affairs. I may remind the Vestry that the name of the street in question —formerly Henry Street—was altered some years since, but it is still very generally called by its former name. At the meeting of the Sub-Committee I was asked, without previous notice, whether I had visited Pardoner Street. Not recognising the name for the moment I was unable to say whether I had or had not, been there. That answer was recorded, and although a little later I explained to the Chairman my position, and requested him to amend my answer, he nevertheless refused to do so. I, therefore, submit that when the Report says I was "unable to say that I had visited" [page 3] the spot in question, it is hardly making a correct statement. As a matter of fact, I visited the place mentioned on two occasions. Moreover, during my week's absence at the British Medical Association Meeting at Carlisle, my Deputy, Dr. Walter Smith, paid more than one visit to Pardoner Street. The same gentleman acted for me after I left for my annual holiday on the 16th August. Deducting these two periods, then, there are six cases of scarlet fever and one of diphtheria which were certified to me personally. Of those seven cases I visited two. In the absence of a copy of evidence it is impossible to enter into many of the statements put forward by the Sub-Committee. It speaks, however, of a mattress being used to close a chimney during sulphuration, and that appears to have actually occurred. I have received from a member of the Sub-Coinmittee a letter acknowledging that she had made an error in her assertions as to another alleged occurrence of a similar kind. In the absence of the evidence upon which the Sub-Committee acted, I am able to point out the following material inaccuracies in the lieport. On page 3 it is stated of two diphtheria cases, described, by the way, as a "group," that one child was removed on July 25th, and another was removed on July 28th. I have the evidence of Dr. Massie, the medical attendant, to prove that both those statements are wrong. Neither one of the children was removed to the hospital. One died at home on July 29th, and the other recovered at home from the diphtheria, but died in the early part of September at St. Thomas's Hospital. As a result of this inquiry the Sub-Committee will probably realise that the 41 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. subject of practical disinfection is beset with difficulties. When I took office in 1892 I found, as I have said, one notification book and one notice paper for schools ; one man who acted both as disinfector and as mortuary keeper; one hand-cart both for conveying infected goods to the apparatus and bringing them back again after disinfection; and an inefficient hot-air disinfecting apparatus. We now, in 1896, have eleven books, eight notice papers, two disinfectors (one of whom attends mortuary and Coroner's court); two hand carts, kept separately, one for infected and one for disinfected goods; one of the best possible modern types of disinfecting apparatus; and use of the Guy's Hospital incinerator for destroying infected articles. The difference between 1892 and 1896 represents, I submit, an enormous advance in practical disinfection. For all that, it may be freely admitted that the present system is far from perfect. That view I have repeatedly urged upon your Vestry. In my Annual Report for 1892, I advocated efficient fumigation and free exposure to air. These two steps are impossible unless the infected room or rooms be vacant for at least twenty-four hours. In this poor parish a majority of the inhabitants live in crowded rooms and tenements. The question naturally arises where persons thus circumstanced are to go if shut out from their room or rooms for twenty-four hours. In other words, we come round to what I have so often pointed out,—namely, the want of a reception-house for individuals who have been exposed to infection. As already said, I agree with the general conclusion of the Sub-Committee that our present methods of room disinfection are imperfect. I cannot agree with them, however, in tracing that imperfection altogether to a failure in duty on the part of the disinfectors. I am inclined to seek the root of the matter first, in the shortness of time during which the rooms are empty and available for sulphur fumigation, and, secondly, in the smallness of the disinfecting staff. In the majority of disinfections dealt with in this parish, about 75 per cent. of the inmates want to sleep at night in the rooms that have been sulphured during the day. This leaves practically some eight hours for fumigation and airing, which is, in my opinion, a totally inadequate allowance. As to the second defect, the want of more disinfectors, the average number of disinfections carried out in a year is 400. Were these evenly distributed, the present staff would no doubt be sufficient. As a matter of fact, however, the cases often come in six or eight in a day, and then it is out of the question for two men to do the work with any approach to thoroughness. As to cleansing infected rooms, and stripping paper from walls, it has always seemed to me that such steps were highly desirable, In organising a system, however, it seemed to me unwise to attempt too much at one time. My energies have, for the last four years, been centred upon the refuge house, as that seemed to me to be the pivot of proper disinfection. Should the Vestry decide to cleanse rooms and strip wall papers under Section 60, it will be necessary (1) to organise a staff for that purpose; (2) to provide a shelter for persons who would be ousted from their rooms (this would be more than ever needed, because the process would become one of days instead of hours, and the walls would be damp.) As regards the alleged defects in the disinfectors' work, I would point out that no specific complaints have been made to me by the sanitary inspectors. Ever since I have been in this parish, the details of practical disinfection have been superintended by the inspectors, with the understanding they should consult me as to any difficulty or defect that might arise. It has also been confirmed by the action of Mr. Edwards, chief inspector, who has invariably given the requisite orders to the men engaged in disinfection. He has never, so far as I can remember, called my attention to anything wrong in disinfection, except as regaids a few articles damaged in the steam apparatus. He has also given verbal instructions to the disinfectors, as I have myself, although I admit that I have never given written instructions. When I took office the disinfector 42 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. had been sixteen years in your service, so that he might reasonably have been expected to have a knowledge of his work that would enable him to act independently - of any written instructions. So far as I can learn, only some three or four of the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health have given anything but verbal instructions to disinfectors. Then, again, the Health Committee has constantly recognised the direct relation of Sanitary Inspectors to Disinfectors by appealing to Mr. Edwards upon points raised at meetings with regard to disinfection. For instance, on 12th October, 1896, the question as to the need of additional help for the disinfectors was asked of Mr. Edwards, although I was present at the time, and, I may add, held entirely different opinions from those put forward by your Chief Inspector. In an office like, mine, where these is an enormous amount of detail to consider, it would be obviously impossible to attend personally to every detail of administration, such as a visit to each notified case. But while the superintendance of disinfection has been in the hands of the Inspectors during the period covered by the Report of the Sub-Committee, I have had no coniphiints about errors of disinfection from the Chief Inspector, through whom such complaints would reach me. In making these plain statements, I do not wish to shirk any technical responsibility as head of the sanitary department. At the same time. I cannot accept the whole responsibility which the Report appears to assume lies upon my shoulders. Nor do I wish to cast any slur upon my Inspectors, who, I believe, have on all occasions acted loyally by their Medical Officer. To sum up this part of the subject. So far as I can learn, the present disinfector has been under the direct control of the Sanitary Inspectors for the last'twenty years. During the four and a half years I have held office he has certainly remained under that control. He has received his orders from the Chief Inspector, Mr. Edwards. The Vestry have recognised that position. Lastly, until the Subcommittee's Report, 1 have had no reason to imagine that any other view of the matter could possibly be taken. The Report quotes that Section of the Sanitary Officer's Act which directs the Medical Officer of Health to visit the site of any outbreak of dangerous infectious disease. I may point out that the interpretation of the word "outbreak" is left entirely to the judgment of the Medical Officer, a point insisted upon by the Local Government Board. In my opinion, ten cases of scarlet fever in Pardoner Street, spread over a period of three weeks and two days, did not warrant the description of an "outbreak." That view was evidently shared by Dr. Smith, who acted as my Deputy during part of the time in which these cases occurred. I may add that by my directions the Sanitary Inspectors visit and take down on a printed form numerous details in every case of notified infectious illness. Under Section (50 of the Public Health Act, the Health Committee, upon receipt of a certificate from the Medical Officer stating that cleansing is necessary in a given case, must issue a notice to the owner to undertake the requisite work. Failing action on the part of the owner within twenty-four hours, the law directs the Vestry to perform the work at their own expense. The cleansing must be done to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer. It is, therefore, left to the individual Medical Officer to decide what is necessary, and whether stripping the paper and white-liming is wanted for proper disinfection. When I came to this parish in 1892. I found that Dr. Walter Smith, who acted as Deputy Medical Officer when the new Act came into force, ordered the paper to be stripped in a scarlet fever case. The cost of that particular cleansing was thirty shillings, which was paid by your Health Committee, but I was informed that the then chairman, Mr. Brazier, with the approval of members present, expressed his opinion that such costly work should not be carried out in future. With that information in view I have refrained from taking action under the Section mentioned. I may add that on several occasions I have brought this matter before the Committee. 2. Suggested Remedies.—The recommendations at the end of the Sub-Committee's Report would certainly meet the approval of almost all Medical Officers of Health. 43 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. In my opinion, however, they do not go far enough, inasmuch as they do not deal with such vital points as the smallness of staff, the extent of cleansing to be enforced, and the provision (already on foot) of a refuge for displaced individuals and families. I would suggest as immediate practical steps that your Vestry appoint an additional disinfector. with women scrubbers and several men to strip walls and cleanse. If disinfection be carried out thoroughly an additional special inspector will be required. In other words, proper disinfection means a large outlay of money. Given unlimited means, it would be comparatively easy to get as perfect a system as could be devised in the present state of scientific knowledge. In fact, the defects pointed out by your Sub-Committee appear to be due, in some instances at any rate, to the policy of expecting the greatest results from the least expenditure. Although I have made my remarks as brief as might be, they nevertheless touch upon a number of important points. The Vestry will now realise why it was impossible to answer the Sub-Committee's Report off-hand, especially in the absence of the evidence on which that Report was based. In some quarters it has been suggested that the Report of the Sub-Committee reflects upon my efficiency as a Medical Officer of Health. I am sure, however, that such an opinion could not be held by those who have followed my work during the past four-and-a-half years, So far from ascribing any such motive to the SubCommittee, I welcome the interest with which they have approached this most difficult subject of room disinfection as of great promise to the future sanitary welfare of this parish. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, F. J. WALDO, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, December 15th, 1896. 44 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwar . ROOM DISINFECTION.

(Signed) J. A. JOHNSON, 1st December, 1896 Vestry Clerk. 48 Parish of St. Georye the Martyr, Southwark. Supplementary Report on Room Disinfection in the Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, by the Medical Officer of Health. Ladies and Gentlemen,—In accordance with the wish expressed by several Members of your Vestry, I have drawn up an outline of the chief points involved in efficient room disinfection. The subject may be considered under the two heads of administration, (a) of Office, (b) of Household. (a) Office.— Under this heading will be taken (1) Notification; (2) Serving of Notices; (3) Keeping of Books; (4) Enforcement of Public Health Act; (5) Granting of Certificates. These various duties are discharged by the Medical Officer of Health, by his Inspectors, by the part services of a Sanitary Clerk, and by the Disinfectors; all acting under the Health Committee. (1) Notification.—Notifications of infectious disease are sent in by medical men at all hours of the day, and are at once opened in the office. It has hitherto been the custom of the Chief Inspector to send one of the disinfectors, when available, to the householder to ascertain whether the friends consented to removal to a fever hospital. Subsequent action is guided by that answer. If the patient is to be removed, the clerk telephones to the central office of the Asylums Board, giving details and asking for the ambulance to be sent. Should the friends object to a removal the District Inspector makes a visit, and if he thinks the case unfitted for home treatment he attempts to persuade the friends to that effect. Failing that, he communicates with the Medical Officer, who usually pays a visit in person. In all cases a District Inspector inspects the premises immediately after notification. A daily record of notifications is made by the clerk in a special register. A second smaller book is also kept for a similar record, with blank spaces to be filled in by the responsible officers after disinfection has been completed, and by the inspectors to show they have visited the house. (2) Notices.—Notice of infection has to be sent within twelve hours to the Metropoltan Asylums Board, and also, in the case of children, to the schools they may be attending. These notices are drawn up by the clerk and sent by hand or post. Both notices are entered on counterfoil in notice book. If the friends assent to removal, a telephonic message to that effect is despatched to the Asylums Board. A copy of the original notification is then sent to the friends of the patient, to be delivered to the attendant in charge of the Asylums' ambulance. This copy has usually been delivered at the house by one of the disinfectors. In every case, according to the directions of the Public Health Act (sections 62 and 65) a special notice (on a printed form) is given to the master of the infected house, directing him to disinfect rubbish before removal, etc. This notice is served by the inspectors. In case the friends refuse the removal of patient, a printed notice is sent for their medical attendant to fill up, as to readiness for final disinfection. This is delivered by the inspectors. If the friends of patient refuse to allow disinfection, a certificate is drawn up by the Medical Officer of Health, saying that disinfection is necessary. The Sanitary Authority then serves a notice that such work must be executed forthwith. Certificates to employers that premises have been disinfected are given to applicants on the old, and now disused, school forms for certifying disinfection. There are no counterfoil for these documents, which are rarely issued (perhaps a dozen have been signed during the last three years). 49 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1896. Notice of disinfections for Head Teachers, taken from a book with counterfoils, are granted as regards (a) school children who have been actually sick, and (b) children who have been living in infected houses, and have been therefore kept from school. This notice is usually sent by post, but now and then by a Disinfector. (3) Keeping of Books.—In my opinion sufficient books are kept, but the system might perhaps be made more perfect. It may be noted, however, that multiplication of books does not always mean increased efficiency. With regard to the " book or books" which the recent Report of the Health Sub-Committee complains are not kept by the Medical Officer, I beg to state that: first, no definition of such " book or books " is contained in the order of the Local Government Board of 8th December, 1891, framed under the Public Health (Lond.) Act, 1891, and, moreover, cannot be procured from the Local Government Board. Secondly, that from my reading of the phrase " baok or books " meant by the order, do, as a matter of fact, already exist in the records of notices, in the registers and in the other books (of which a full list has been given in my Report of 15th December, 1896). All of the foregoing records, together with my book containing reports to the Vestry, are kept in my office. (4) Enforcement of Public Health Act.—It is hardly necessary to enter at length into this point. Careful records are kept by the Inspector of every detail with regard to legal proceedings, in special registers kept in the office. % (b) Household.—Under this heading, which deals with the administration of disinfection as it affects the household, we may consider the following points:— (1) Methods employed in Infected Booms.—In my opinion nothing has yet been introduced that answers better for practical work than sulphur fumigation. At the same time the "spray" (corrosive sublimate), or other systems, may or may not be more efficient, but their use would be attended with possible drawbacks that call for careful consideration before abondoning the use of sulphur. As to the way in which sulphur should be applied, the directions are simple enough. I have drawn lip a code of such rules for the guidance of the Disinfectors, which will be found in the Appendix. It may be added that, so far as can be learnt, written instructions have been given to Disinfectors by only two of the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health. It may be as well to urge here, as I have often done before, that sulphur fumigation must be regarded as a part only of room disinfection; free exposure to air and cleansing are furthur essentials to the complete process. The question of cleansing I shall refer to later when discussing the "enforcement of Section 60 of the Public Health Act. " In nearly all cases disinfectants are distributed gratis by the Disinfectors for the use of infected households. This is done shortly after the arrival of the notification at the office. (2) Carriage of goods to disinfecting apparatus is effected by the Chief Disinfector and by his assistant, or, in the absence of the latter, by the Chief Disinfector and one of the roadmen. The carriage used weighs upwards of a quarter of a ton, and is, in my opinion, far too heavy for the purpose, unless a pony be provided. The wheeling of this heavy cart, which must altogether weigh some half a ton or more when full, to and fro between the infected houses to the disinfecting station is a great tax on the strength of the disinfectors, particularly in windy weather. When the journey has to be repeated from four to eight times in a day the men engaged will have little energy to bestow on other parts of their work. As to the goods to be removed, I would certainly advice that all portable articles, such as beds, bedding, carpets, curtains, and the like, be taken away in the canvas bags supplied for the purpose, after a list has been made of such articles. (3) Disinfecting Apparatus.—Nothing need be said as to this beyond the fact that the Vestry has possessed for the last three years a Washington Lyon's apparatus of the best type. 50 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. (4) Incinerator.— Articles to be destroyed are burnt by arrangement at Guy's Hospital. (5) Dress of Disinfectors.— However desirable it would be in theory to have a removable dress, disinfected after every exposure, yet it would be extremely difficult to carry out the proposal in practice. Very few doctors, it may be noted, attempt anything of the kind. To be theoretically safe, disinfectors, inspectors, and medical attendants should pass their clothes through a steam apparatus, and have an antiseptic bath after every visit to an infected house. I am strongly of opinion, however, that the disinfectors should have their own room away from the Vestry. (6) Time taken by Process.—The disinfection of a room by sulphur, its sealing up and fumigating, going to and from the disinfecting station, with the removal of infected articles, will take up at least two hours. For the last four years the average number of disinfections has been over four hundred per annum, or rather more than one and onethird each day. If these cases were distributed evenly, the present staff of disinfectors could doubtless perform the work. As, however, cases are unevenly distributed, it is common to have four disinfections in a day, and as many as eight have had to be carried out within that period. Now, simply to clear and sulphur four rooms would take eight hours, to say nothing of the time required for passing goods through the Lyon's apparatus. (Each lot of infected articles requires three-quarters of an hour's exposure or more in the oven, besides the hour which is taken in getting up steam.) Then furthur, the Assistant Disinfector is often engaged upon Coroner's duty. During last week, for example, he had to attend seven inquests, and on one day to be present at four post mortem examinations. From these various reasons there is a constant temptation to hurry through all the steps of disinfection. Moreover, the whole process is sometimes put off for a day, a practice which can hardly be too strongly condemned. As a matter of fact, the disinfectors, in times of pressure, have not opened the sulphured rooms in some instances until nine at night. Under these circumstances the need of an increase of the staff of disinfectors will be fairly apparent to your Vestry, as a first step towards efficient disinfection. (7) The enforcement of Section 60 of the Public Health Act.—This point is of considerable importance, and its desirability has been urged by the recent Report of the Health Sub-Committee. The aim of the section in question is to enforce "cleansing" and disinfection. As the latter is carried out by the Vestry, "cleansing" alone remains to be considered. Speaking generally, I regard the proper cleansing of a room with disinfectants as essential to thorough disinfection. Further, I am inclined to think that stripping of the walls is advisable in a majority of infectious eases. Proper cleansing, therefore, is chiefly a matter of expenditure. I may say that, personally, I shall be most anxious to learn the precise wishes of your Vestry as to what is to be done in future as regards both stripping of walls and washing of rooms. (8) The Refuge House.—The need for this house is still pressing, and the more efficient the process of disinfection, the greater will be the need of such a shelter. If "spray" methods be substituted for the present sulphur fumigation, and the stripping of walls and washing enforced, it will be impossible, as heretofore, for most of the dwellers of infected rooms (75 per cent.) to return to their disinfected lodging on the night of disinfection. It must be admitted that the system of room disinfection as practised in this Parish is open to improvement. The subject, however, is so complicated and hedged in with difficulties that it will have to be approached cautiously, and with a full knowledge of the many points involved. The present Supplementary Report will, I think, convince members of the want of clerical help in the Sanitary Office. It will also point to the need of an increase in the staff of disinfectors, and of a Refuge House. As already 51 Animal Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. remarked, I shall be glad to learn the exact wishes of your Vestry with regard to the enforcement of Section 60 of the Public Health Act, so that steps may be immediately taken to carry out your directions. In conclusion, I venture to throw out the following suggestions:—- 1. That the District Inspector, instead of the Disinfector, pay the first visit to the household upon receipt of notification. 2. That the present books, with one or two modifications, are sufficient. 3. That disinfectors have nothing to do with the delivery of notices, or with office work generally. 4. That disinfectors have their own room away from the Health Office. 5. That a counterfoil book be kept for the certificates of disinfection granted to workmen for their employers; and that such documents be marked so as to confine them to that definite purpose. 6. That in case of removal each householder be provided with a form or stamped post card (addressed to the Vestry) to be filled up and forwarded as soon as the patient is removed by the Asylum Board. 7. That the records of Inspectors' visit might be extended, and made more systematic in some respects. 8. A trained clerk to be appointed solely for Health Office work. 9. That another disinfector be appointed, so as to have at least two such officers available as competent disinfectors. 10. That the appointment of assistants to strip walls and wash rooms is desirable if Section 60 is to be enforced. 11. That the appointment of a special Sanitary Inspector would be a great help to thorough disinfection. I have the honour to remain, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, F. J. WALDO. APPENDIX TO SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. Provisional Code of Rules for disinfection of premises for the guidance of Disinfectors, subject to the approval of the Vestry. On receiving notice from the Sanitary Inspectors of the need of disinfecting a room or rooms, the disinfectors are to carry out the following instructions:— 1. In every case the premises must be disinfected on the day of receipt of such notice from the Inspector, and that the Disinfectors attend at the office at half-past nine each morning at the Health Office, for the purpose of receiving instructions. 2. Every room that has been exposed to infection must be disinfected. 3. Subject to the above requirements the convenience of parishioners must be 52 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southward. studied, and any complaint of incivility or of neglect in following out these rules will be regarded as a serious breach of duty. 4. Before burning the sulphur all gilt, lacquered or copper fittings or ornamentation shall be removed from the room, washed with a cloth wrung out of carbolic acid solution (1 in 30), and placed outside the door; also all portable articles such as beds, bedding, carpets, curtains, and the like, shall be removed in canvas bags for disinfection in the steam apparatus, after a list has been made. 5. The chimney opening, windows, ventilators, cracks, apertures, and doors shall be securely sealed by means of thin brown paper and paste, a supply of both of which materials shall be kept at the disinfecting station. 6. Sulphur candles, to amount to 1½ pounds of sulphur to 1,000 cubic feet of air, shall bo burnt in an iron bucket or pail provided by the Vestry for the purpose, and no other method shall be us used. 7. In every case the room must remain sealed up for six hours at least; eight hours, if it can be arranged. 8. The disinfectors, shall, after six hours or longer, call at the premises, unseal the room, throw the door and windows wide open, and advise the occupier to let the room be thus freely exposed to the fresh air for (if possible) twenty-four hours. If that length of time cannot be arranged, the room must be left open as many hours as can be managed. 9. All infected goods ordered to be burnt shall be forthwith removod in the truck to the Incinerator. 10. On completing the disinfection of a room, notice by means of the signature of the disinfector shall be entered in the book kept for that purpose. 11. Where overalls are worn by disinfectors, they should invariably bo passed through the steam apparatus after each exposure to infection. 12. The canvas bags for fetching infected articles must be passed through the steam apparatus after each exposure. 13. The infected goods truck to bo sulphured after each conveyance of infected articles. F. J. WALDO, 12th January, 1897. Medical Officer of Health. Report of Special Committee on Dr. Waldo's Supplementary Report on the Public Health Committee's Report on Room Disinfection. To the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Ladies and Gentlemen.—The Supplementary Report on Room Disinfection has boon carefully considered by the Speeial Committee. It may be well to remind the Vestry of the circumstances in which this Eeport was presented. The Vestry received and adopted on December 1st, a report dated November 27th, from the Health Committee, giving the results of an inquiry into room-disinfection as practised in this parish. The report contained an outline of the system under which disinfection has been carried out. They also reported on the way in which infectious cases, when notified, had been treated, both as regards disinfection and the Medical Officer's visits. 53 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. The recommendations of the Committee were briefly these:— 1.—That the M. O. H. be requested to prepare detailed instructions for the guidance of the disinfecting officers, as to the steps which should be taken for the sealing of doors, windows, fireplaces, &c.; for the removal of beds, bedding, curtains, &c.; and the wearing and disinfection of overalls. That the work of disinfection should be under the general supervision of the M. O. H., and the more detailed supervision of the sanitary inspectors; and that suitable appliances should be provided to ensure efficient sulphuration. 2.—That the M. O. H. should be requested to carry out the requirements of the L.G.B. as regards visiting and reporting on outbreaks of infectious diseases, and endeavouring to arrest the spread of such diseases—as contained in the Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1891, Art. 18., Sec. 6 and Sec. 14. That he be required to carry out, as regards attendance at the office, the duties specified in par. 1 of the list, of duties which he signed at the time of bis appointment. [Par. 1 reads as follows:— "He shall attend at the Vestry Hall every weekday, from 10 until 11 o'clock a.m., and from 3 to 4 o'clock p.m., or at such other time as the Vestry may direct."] 3.—That a suitable register be provided of forms of certificate, with counterfoil, to be given to the employers as to the freedom from infection of their employees. 4.—That the sanitary inspectors be required to carry out the provisions of the Order, Art 19., Sec. 9, which requires that "he shall enter from day to day, in a book to be provided by the Sanitary Authority, particulars of his inspection, and of the action taken by him in the execution of his duties. He shall also keep a book or books, to be provided by the Sanitary Authority, so arranged as to form, as far as possible, a continuous record of the sanitary condition of each of the premises in respect of which any action has been taken under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; or under any other statute or statutes; and shall keep any other systematic records that the Sanitary Authority may require." 5.—That the Vestry approach the Metropolitan Asylums Board with a request to consider whether any system could be arranged whereby the Vestry could be informed, without delay, of the removal of patients. The report also called attention to the fact that the doctor did not keep a book according to Art. 18, Sec. 14, of the General Order. In a report dated December 15th, 1896, Dr. Waldo replied to tha Health Committee's statement. The report was divided into two sections:—first, Criticism of present disinfecting methods; second, Suggested remedies. He states, "one of the chief points is that I do not keep sufficient books regarding infectious cases "; and after setting forth the various books which are kept, he continues—" I quite recognise that in certain respects the keeping of more books would be an advantage, so far as it can be done without taking up time which might be more usefully spent in visiting and other duties of my office. At the same time, I may say, that lately I have been deprived of the services of the one clerk who formerly did much of the clerical work required in the Sanitary Department. Moreover, I have often found the possession of books most undesirable when given evidence in Court, as they may be demanded by the opposing council. For this reason I have, to some extent, trusted to the notes of visits taken by my sanitary inspectors, which should invariably mention the fact when I have been present. " On this your Committee have two observations to make. 1.—The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1891, Art. 18, Sec. 14, requires "that the M.O.H. shall keep a book or books to be provided by the Sanitary Authority, in which he shall make an entry of his 54 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. visits and notes of his observations and instructions thereon; and also the date and nature of applications made to him; the date and result of the action taken thereon, and of any action taken on previous reports; and shall produce such book or books whenever required to the Sanitary Authority." Your Committee are of opinion that this doty has been neglected. It is true that the M.O.H. now keeps—dating from November 16th, 1896—a small memorandum book; but in such form that he finds it impossible to answer any question on a particular case which may be put to him. He stated that any similar books which he might have kept were lost during the alterations. This is singularly unfortunate, as these note books are the most important documents that the Health Department possessed. It is scarely creditable that they should not have been put in a place of safe custody. Had he preserved a proper record much time would have been saved, and his duties would have been performed in a much more satisfactory manner. 2.—As regards the withdrawal of the clerk in the Sanitary Department, this official was withdrawn in order that he might be placed under some supervision. The irregularity of the doctor's attendance, and the circumstance that he did not carry out his obligation to attend at the office at certain definite hours induced the Vestry to remove this officer to the General Office. Whenever the M.O.H. required his services, they were placed at his disposal. As a matter of fact, the M.O.H. did not supervise his work. As regards the statement in the same Report that "the Sub-Committee ascribed his inability to state whether or not he had visited Pardoner Street to the absence of books, that did not represent the state of affairs;" and he reminded the Vestry that Pardoner Street was formerly Henry Street, and "is still generally called by its former name," your Committee observe that the doctor was appointed in May, 1892, and the street was re-named in December, 1892. "Not recognising the name," he continues, "I was unable to say whether I had or had not been there," and, "a little later I explained to the Chairman my position, and requested him to amend my answer, and the Chairman refused." The contention of the Committee is that had the M.O.H. kept proper books he would have been able to recognise the street, either as Pardoner Street or Henry Street. If this note book had been properly indexed he would have been able to say the dates when he visited. It is, however, scarcely necessary to consider this particular case further. As regards the M.O.'s general observations on Boom-Disinfection, and the way in which the disinfecting officers discharge their duties, your Committee are of opinion that the doctor should have given a more detailed supervision. It is no doubt true that the Chief Inspector gives instructions; but supervision and instructions are not the same thing; and the M.O. is ultimately responsible. Either he is head of the Department, or he is not. If he is head, then for any failure of duty on the part of any subordinate official the Sanitary Authority look to him for report. Especially, your Committee would have expected this to be the case, having regard to the constant recommendations which the doctor has made as to the provision of a Kefuge House. The system of disinfection which had obtained was admittedly inadequate. The greater, therefore, the necessity for the M.O. to exercise far more detailed supervision than is ordinarily to be expected of such officers. If the doctor had realized his obligations in this particular (especially when regard is paid to the implicit confidence which the Vestry had hitherto reposed in his ability), the method and system of disinfection would long since have been reformed. But for the future, the Vestry should decide whether the ultimate responsibility for the due discharge of duty by the disinfectors should be in the M.O.'s or in the Chief Inspector's hands, your Committee hold that the M.O. is, and should remain responsible. As regards the exact connotation of the word "outbreak" in reference to the Pardoner Street cases of scarlet fever, the interest is academic rather than practical. 55 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. It may be held necessary that, for future guidance, the Vestry should lay the whole facts of the case before the L.G.B. and ask for their ruling in the matter. The enforcement of Section 60 of the Public Health Act is the last point dealt with by the M.O. in this portion of his report. Your Committee deals with this matter at a later period. The report concludes with suggested remedies. These are dealt with in detail in the Supplementary Report presented to the Vestry at its meeting on January 12th. Before its reception by the Vestry the M.O. was instructed to submit the same to a Special Committee. With this your Committee propose now to deal. As copies have been sent to every member of the Vestry, it will have been observed that the doctor deals with the matter under the following heads:— Administration of (a) Office, and (b) Household. (a) Office. Notifications. These are received at all hours of the day. Tho M.O, is due at 10 a.m., the Chief Sanitary Inspector and staff at 9.30. They review the doctor's correspondence, and such letters as they think contain notifications, they open, according to the doctor's instructions. The Chief Sanitary Inspector sends a disinfector to the case notified, to learn if the friends are willing that the patient should be removed. If tho answer is in the affirmative, the Sanitary Clerk telephones to the M.A.B.; should the friends refuse, the District Inspector visits, and, if he thinks it desirable, he attempts to persuade the patient to be removed: if his efforts fail, he communicates verbally with the M.O., who "usually pays a visit in person. " Your Committee endeavoured to learn what percentage of such cases the M.O. visited in the months of October, November, and December. The doctor was unable to give any information, because he keeps no record; various cases were selected at haphazard, and, on being asked whether he had visited he could not reply for the reason already stated. From the stand point of administration such a result Is most unsatisfactory; from the stand point of the patients themselves it is even worse; for the statement has been made, and not contradicted, that whenever the doctor does visit, speaking generally, he succeeds where others fail. The doctor states that a "daily record of notifications'' is kept, but your Committee find that such record has not been kept entered day by day. This circumstance is to be regretted, for reasons which are fresh in the memory of the Vestry; had the M.O. exercised a detailed supervision, this book would have been properly kept. A second smaller book which, since the date of the first inquiry, has been improved, is also kept, and affords further information. But it is inadequate, and additional colums should be provided, in one of which should be preserved a record of the M.O.'s visits when made. As regards the certificates of disinfection granted to employers, the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Health Committee, has already ordered that a counterfoil book should be prepared. As regards the notices of disinfection for head teachers, your Committee, are of opinion that they should always be sent by post- In reference to the keeping of books, your Committee cannot concur in the doctor's view that sufficient books are kept, nor are they properly systemised; nor are they kept up to date. This is indispensably necessary if the work of the Health Department is to be efficiently done; and furthermore, your Committee strongly recommend that the M.O. shall be required to keep the book indicated in Art. 18, Sec. 14, of the Sanitary Officer's (London) Order, 1891. Had this book been in existence, and properly kept, a vast amount of time would have been saved, and unpleasantness avoided in the course of this enquiry. If the doctor declines to keep such diary, your Committee has no 56 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. alternative but to recommend the Vestry to appeal to the L.G.B., and request that the M.O. may be called upon to resign. Such book should be examined and initialled by the Chairman at every meeting of the Sub-Committee appointed by the Health Committee to examine the books of the Department. It should contain practically a continuous record of his work. At present the Vestry has no knowledge of the time which he spends in the parish, nor the business on which he is engaged. (b) Household. Methods of disinfection employed in infected rooms. (1) It has never been suggested that the Spray disinfector should in all cases supersede the sulphur; the spray method was only recommended in those cases where, in the M.O.'s opinion, efficient sulphuration was impossible; but whenever the M.O. is of opinion that disinfection by sulphur is the more desirable system to be employed, the Vestry will probably be prepared to defer to his expert opinion. It must, however, be on the distinct understanding that he takes such steps as will insure a scrupulous discharge of duty on the part of the disinfectors, so as to make this system as effective as possible. As regards the instructions to disinfectors contained in the Appendix, your Committee recommend that they be referred back to the M.O. for further consideration and report. They appear to have been compiled hurriedly, and are not arranged with sufficient care; they are scarcely worthy of the M.O's. reputation. (2) As regards the carriage of goods to the disinfecting apparatus, your Committee cannot concur in the view that a pony should be provided to draw the truck. Even when full, it is not too heavy for two men to draw. In time of pressure the disinfectors have the asistauce of one or more of the roadmen. But this general question would, your Committee submit, be more profitably dealt with at a later period. (3.) In reference to the wearing of overalls—the M.O. states that their use would be difficult in practice, though desirable in theory. Your Committee are of opinion that the dress should be provided, and the disinfectors, if possible, induced to wear it—the difficulties do not appear insuperable; but in any case the responsibility of ultimate decision should remain with the doctor as the head of the Health Department. (4.) Now, as regards an increase of staff, which the doctor recommends, your Committee are of opinion that greater supervision is required, rather than a permanent increase of staff. In times of pressure, no doubt two disinfectors cannot do the work; but additional men are provided by the Works Department when required. The daily average of cases is only 1.3 per diem. If there are occasionally six and even eight cases (but of this latter number no instance has happened in the last six months) in a single day, there are also periods when the disinfectors, qua disinfectors, have no work whatever. And even if the staff were permanently increased, in times of extreme pressure, casual help would still have to be obtained. Your Committee, therefore, recommend that, for the present, the staff be not increased. (5.) We pass to the enforcement of Sec. 60 of the Public Health Act. We note that the contention of the Committee which conducted the inquiry into the system of room-disinfection is practically admitted, viz.:—that the provisions of this Section, as far as cleansing is concerned, had not till then been enforced. No doubt the question is difficult, but each case should be decided on its merits; and with the exercise of tact and discretion, the experience of other Sanitary Authorities would probably be repeated in this district. At any rate, since the recommendation of the Health Committee on this matter was adopted by the Vestry, thirty-eight notices under this Section have been 57 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health.—1896. served, and with one exception have been complied with. The provision of a permanent staff, however, for this purpose is not within the range of practical politics, for the reason already stated in reference to the suggested increase in the number of disinfectors; it cannot be, until the Refuge House is ready for occupation; for this is an indispensable necessity, if the provisions of Sec. 60 are to be completely and universally enforced. (6.) As to the provision of a Sanitary Clerk; that is, of a clerk whose time shall be exclusively devoted to sanitary work, your Committee cannot recommend such an appointment, until they are convinced that the M.O. intends to give more personal snpervision to questions of detail. The late sanitary clerk was removed from the Sanitary Inspector's Office because he had not sufficient supervision. If the M.O. intends to look after the details of his work, then no doubt such an official should be appointed. If his Department is to be administered, as regards details, in the future, as it has hitherto been in the past, it is certainly not worth while. As to the suggestions with which the M.O. concludes his report—(1) the first, to the effect that the District Inspector and not the disinfector, should pay the first visit, after notification seems eminently desirable, and has already been recommended by the Health Committee. Similarly, with regard to (2) the provision of a counterfoil book of certificates of disinfection, granted to workmen for their employers; and similarly as regards (3) the extension and systemising of the records of Sanitary Inspectors' visits. (4) In the recommendation that the present books are sufficient, your Committee cannot concur—and the insufficiency of the books seems to have been the view of the doctor himself, according to his report dated December 15th, 1896. Neither the present system, nor the way in which the books are kept, reflects credit on the Health Department. The Health Committee should, for their own credit's sake, be instructed to take the whole matter into their serious consideration. (5.) All notices which do not require legal proof of delivery should be sent by post. (6.) We see no reason why a room for the disinfectors should be provided. Your Committee have not learned in the course of their enquiry that the disinfectors have any writing work to do other than that of entering up their respective diaries. (7.) The provision of a stamped form or postcard, whereby the friends may acquaint the M.O. of the removal of a patient, may be useful in a majority of cases, but we fear that the system will not be completely satisfactory. We lean to a recommendation already received by the Vestry to the effect that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should inform the Vestry when an order of removal to an infectious hospital has been issued to the Ambulance Superintendent. (8.) As to the provision of a Clerk, your Committee would be prepared to recommend such an appointment, if, as has already been stated, they had ground for hope that adequate supervision, and a proper system of work, were to be arranged for such an official. (9.) If the work of the present disinfectors were to be, to some extent, rearranged, the present staff would prove sufficient. Nor can they recommend (10) the appointment of a permanent staff of assistants for the enforcement of Sec. 60; nor can they endorse (11.) the doctor's recommendation that another Sanitary Inspector should be appointed. In the L.C.C's. return, they observe that this parish, judged by population, number of inhabited houses, and rateable value, has the largest staff of Inspectors of any parish of more than 50,000 inhabitants, in the Metropolis. Your Committee has learned in the course of this enquiry that it is the practice of the L.G.B. to send communications of a confidential character to the M.O., the contents of which be is not in a position to divulge to the Vestry. We recommend that the 58 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. L.G.B. be requested to intimate to the Vestry the general lines on which such communications are based, for harmonious co-operation between the M.O. and the Sanitary Authority becomes unnecessarily difficult under the system which at present obtains. (Signed) FREDK. REDMAN, February 5th, 1897. Chairman. The following resolution was passed by your Vestry on the 9th of February, 1897:— "That the attention of the L.G.B. be called to the Special Committee's Report adopted by the Vestry on February 9th, and that they be respectfully requested to consider the same in relation to the Report on Disinfection of December 1st, 1896, already submitted, and that they be further requested to advise the Vestry whether the method and standard of administration in the Sanitary Department of this Parish is conducive to the public interest, regard being paid to the level of poverty and health which already obtains in this District." To this the Local Government Board replied as follows:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., March 6th, 1897. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th ult., enclosiug copy of a report made by a Special Committee appointed by the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, to consider a supplementary Report on room disinfection, presented to the Vestry by their Medical Officer of Health on January 12th last, and, in reply, I am to state that the information before the Board is not sufficient to enable them to advise the Vestry on the questions raised in the resolution, a copy of which also accompanied your letter. I am to add that the Board are not aware of any grounds for the statement at the conclusion of the Special Committee's Report, that it is the practice of the Board to send to the Medical Officer of Health confidential communications, the contents of which he is not at liberty to divulge to the Vestry. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) ALFRED D. ADRIAN, J. A. Johnson, Esq., Assistant Secretary. Clerk to the Vestry of the Parish of St. George the Martyr. Southwark. Copy of Evidence of Medical Officer of Health in support of the London County Council "London (Falcon Court, Borough) Improvement Scheme, 1895." The 111 dwelling-houses which the Council propose in their scheme to sweep away, cover, in my opinion, an insanitary area. These houses—lining Birdcage Alley, Falcon Court, Brent's Court, Eve's Place, Red Cross Court, and Maypole Alley—are approached from the Borough High Street by means of covered passages which are narrow and funnel-shaped. The Falcon area again is hemmed in on the west, by the lofty Stanhope, Mowbray, and St. George's model dwellings, as well as by the 59 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. Voluntary Roman Catholic School; on the east by the row of houses lining the Borough High Street; and on the north and south by warehouses. In addition, Messrs. Smith's Medicated Lozenge Manufactory, the Midland Railway Receiving Depot, and sundry warehouses stand between the parallel courts and alleys comprised in the unhealthy area. This arrangement—an obstructive one—taken in conjunction with an existing faulty construction and grouping of houses in the area in question, prevents a due admission of light and air. The dwellings themselves in many cases have no means of obtaining a through ventilation, and in those instances where a back-yard is present such yard is usually narrow and insufficient for purposes of ventilation. The cellars—especially of the back-to-back houses in the Falcon Court—often contain the W.C.'s, ash-pails, and other sanitary conveniences. They also serve as kitchens, and are generally used for the washing and drying of clothes, as well as for other purposes. The occupied houses of the Falcon Court area cover together 1 acre 30 poles— that is to say—rather under 1¼ acres, and upon that space 821 human beings are concentrated. The population density for the whole parish of St. George the Martyr is 211 to an acre as against 58 for London. Eighty-nine deaths of inhabitants of the Falcon Area are known to have occurred during the four years 1892-3-4 and 5 which figures gave an average death-rate of 29.5 per 1,000. The (corrected) death-rates for 1892-3-4 and 5 are 24.6 for the whole parish, and 19.5 for London. It is but fair to remark, however, that the only address given of parishioners who died in the St. Saviour's Union Workhouse at Dulwich, is the vague general one of "St. George's, Southwark." This fact may tell either for or against the actual mortality return of the Falcon Area. It seems more likely that a large proportion of those who die at Dulwich Workhouse, come from the Falcon Area for the following reasons:— (1) The poverty and general character of its residents; (2) The presence of three common lodging-houses, having 128 male and female lodgers; and (3) The probability of such a class of resident drifting into the Union house. If then, a large proportion of the Workhouse deaths is to be attributed to the Falcon Court, it is evident that the death-rate of 29.5 per 1,000 does not represent the facts of the case. The average death-rate from the seven chief zymotic or preventable diseases, for the years 1892-3-4 and 5 is 4T per 1,000, as against 3.2 per 1,000 in the whole Parish, and 2.7 per 1,000 in London, for the same period. The average deaths under one year of age to every 1,000 births for the years 1892-3-4 and 5 number 407 in the Falcon Area, as compared with 206 in the whole Parish, and 163 in London for the same time. The average percentage of deaths in the Falcon area which occurred under five years of age to the total number of deaths for the years 1892-3-4 and 5 is 67. This compares with the high figure of 49.7 for the whole Parish, and 35.7 for London, for the same period. In other words, of every 100 deaths which took place in the Falcon area 67 were those of children under the age of five years. These figures point, also, to the fact that the percentage of deaths under five year8 of age to the total number of deaths from the Falcon area was almost double that for the whole of London. The three tables herewith appended give particulars of the mortality from the chief diseases at three age periods. 60 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Soutthwark. In conclusion, I may add, that during the three years 1893-4 and 5 the Vestry of St. George's have caused 188 official notices to be served, under the Health Acts, on owners and occupiers of property within the area under inquiry. This action, however, has only touched the fringe of a long-standing and insanitary evil, and has merely ended in the removal of a few of the grosser and more glaring defects. On the other hand, those faults of a structural nature, which are both many in number and of a serious nature can, in my opinion, be alone mended by radical measures in the shape of a rehousing scheme, followed by demolition of the buildings covering the area.

The best means of Preventing the Attack of the Disease, and of Stopping it when it has Broken Out. It is required by law that every child be vaccinated within three months of its birth ; parents or persons in charge of infants are liable to prosecution and fines for omission. It cannot be too widely known that vaccination is one of the best means of preventing an attack of Small-pox. All persons above twelve years of age should be re-vaccinated. When Small-pox prevails in a family or neighbourhood, every person should be immediately re-vaccinated. When an individual has Small-pox, everything should be done to separate the person attacked from those around. Since Small-pox is pre-eminently contagious in all stages of the disease every case should at once be removed to a Small-pox Hospital. If the patient be treated at home, the sickroom should be cleared of all needless furniture, including woollen or other draperies, which serve to harbour contagion. No person should be allowed to enter the room, except those who are attending upon the sick. Where persons have had Small-pox, whether they get well or die, the room in which they have been ill, and all articles therein should be disinfected. The inhabitants of the parish who may at any time have any bedding or clothing which requires to be disinfected, are requested to give notice thereof without delay at the Vestry Hall, Borough Road ; such articles will then be removed by the officers of the Vestry, disinfected, and returned without any charge whatever.

Regulations as to Furnishing Information Relative to the Condition of Patients, and as to the Visiting of Patients. Information as to Conditions of Patients— 2. Upon the admission of a patient, a letter will be sent to the nearest known relative or friend, setting forth the state of the patient. Should any serious change for the worse take place, a letter will be sent daily to the relative or friend, stating how the patient is progressing; which letter will be continued until the patient is in such a condition as to render further communications unnecessary. But should the patient become dangerously ill notice will be sent to the nearest known relative or intimate friend, with an intimation that the patient may be visited; and, at the discretion of the Medical Superintendent, arrangements may be made for the conveyance of the visitor to and from the hospital. 3. Enquiries as to the conditions of patients must be made in writing to the Medical Superintendent, who will reply by return of post. It is very undesirable that friends of patients should personally make enquiries at the hospital. Visiting— 4. The visiting of patients is limited to the nearest relatives and intimate friends of patients dangerously ill. One visit only will be allowed daily to each patient. Visits, which will not be allowed without the permission of the Medical Superintendent, are, as a rule, to be limited in duration to a quarter of an hour. In urgent and special cases, however, the Medical Superintendent is empowered to increase the number of visitors to two, and to extend the duration of the visit. 5. Visitors are warned that they run great risk in entering the hospitals. They ara advised not to go into the wards of the small-pox hospitals without having been properly re-vaccinated, and if they reside where the case visited occurred, are earnestly requested to urge the remainder of the occupiers of such house to call at once on the Public Vaccinator (whose address can be obtained from any of the parish officers) for the purpose of being vaccinated. 6. Visitors are further advised not to enter the wards in any of the hospitals when in a weak state of health or in an exhausted condition, but to partake of a good meal before entering the hospital. They will be required when in the wards to carefully avoid touching the patient, or exposing themselves to his breath, or to the emanations from his skin; and will not be permitted to sit on the bed or handle the bed clothes, but will be allowed to sit on a chair at the bedside at some little distance from the patient. 7. Visitors will also be required to wear a wrapper (to be provided by the Board) to cover their dress when in the wards, and to wash their hands and faces with carbolic soap and water before leaving the hospital, or to use such other mode of disinfection as may be directed by the Medical Superintendent. 8. Visitors are strongly urged not to enter any omnibus, tramcar, or other public conveyance immediately after leaving the hospital.

Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. 83 Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 17th December, 1896. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to forward to you, herewith, copies of Forms to be appended to the Annual Reports for 1896, required to be made by Medical Officers of Health, together with a Memorandum as to the Annual Reports to be made by those Officers, and I am to request that these copies may be sent without delay to the Medical Officer of Health for the District. The Report itself will doubtless contain detailed statistical information, but the Board think it desirable that, in addition, tabular statements of Sickness and Mortality should be made in all districts on a uniform -plan, and it is with this object that the forms in question are issued. I am at the same time, to remind the Authority that if the Medical Officer of Health fails to send to the Board such a Report as is required by the Regulations, it will devolve on them to certify the fact to the County Council, and in that case, under Section 24 (2) (c) of the Local Government Act, 1888, a sum equal to one-half of his Salary will be forfeited to the Crown, and the Sanitary Authority will lose the benefit -of the re-paymcnt of a moiety of the Salary by the County Council. It is important that the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health should be made within a reasonable time after the close of the year to which it relates, and the Board trust that they will receive at an early date in the coming year, the copy which is to be transmitted to them. I am further to request that the attention of the Medical Officer of Health may be called to the 19th Section of the same Act, under which be is required also to. send a copy of the Annual Report to the County Council. I 'am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) HUGH OWEN, Secretary. To the Vestry Clerk of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. Memorandum as to Annual Reports of Medical Officers of Health. Every Medical Officer of Health, appointed under Order of the Local Government Board, is required to make an annual report with regard to the Sanitary District which is under his superintendence. This report is to be for the year ending the 31st December, or, if the Officer at that date has not been in office for a whole year, then for so much of the year as has elapsed since his appointment. The report is to be made to the Sanitary Authority, and the Medical Officer of Health himself should send a copy of it to the Local Government Board and to the London County Council. It should be made to the Sanitary Authority as soon as practicable after the expiration of the year to which it relates, and should be in the hands both of the Sanitary Authority and of the Local Government Board within, at most, five months from the end of the year. The Board's copy of the report should be forwarded to them when the original is sent to the Sanitary Authority, except where the report is likely to be printed by order of the Authority. In such cases the Board need only be supplied with a printed copy. Article 18 (Section 15) of the Board's Order of 8th December, 1891, specifies the information to be contained in the Annual Report, and is printed below. 84 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. The report should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the District and with the means for improving these conditions. It should consider these subjects with reference to the past and future as well as to the particular year; and the account of the sanitary state of the District generally should, while marking the point that has been reached in the sanitary state and administration of the District, indicate directions for further consideration and action. The sanitary history of the year under review should include a record alike of the proceedings of the Medical Officer himself and of the proceedings taken tinder his direction or advice. The Medical Officer of Health, in reporting his proceedings and advice, may find it convenient to follow, in the main, the order in which the subject matters of his duty appear in the several paragraphs of Article 18. Special care should be taken to report fully and explicitly in reporting on the influences affecting or threatening to affect injuriously the public health within the District; and the causes, origin, and distribution of disease within the district may usefully be the subjects of annual record. An account should also be given both of the actual circumstances of the District tip to the end of the past year, and of any improvement or deterioration that has occurred during the year in conditions conducive to health or to disease. For example, a vigilant health officer has in his annual report an opportunity for pointing out any facts as to water supplies and house construction, conditions of storage, and of removal of refuse customary in the district; together with any facts as to the adequacy or inadequacy of means of isolation and of disinfection, and the like. And such a Health Officer, reporting on the diseases and their causes within the district, will generally have some instructive details to give, either of conditions newly productive of disease, or of matters that have been remedied with advantage to the public health. In reporting upon section 3, not only should the fact of having made systematic inspections, but the outcome from those inspections should be duly put on record. The report should contain a full account of inspections, whether systematic or occasional, of the judgment which the Medical Officer of Health has formed thereon as to the sanitary state of his District, and of the .advice he has in consequence given to the Sanitary Authoity and the action taken by the Authority thereon. By "systematic" inspections are meant inspections independent of such enquiries as, under other article of the Order, the Medical Officer of Health has to make into particular outbreaks of disease, or into unwholesome conditions to which his attention may have been specially called by complaints or otherwise, and such inspections will include the house-to-house inspections which may be necessary in particular localities. In making systematic inspections, as in much of his other action, the Medical Officer of Health will usually have required the assistance of the Inspector of Nuisances ; and it will be for the Medical Officer to include in his report an account of the action which, at his instance, the Inspector may have taken for the removal of nuisances injurious to health. The tabular statements of sickness and mortality in the District during the year, to be made on the forms supplied for the purpose, should be the subject of comment in the text of the report, in so far as deductions from them may assist the Sanitary Authority to an appreciation of the lines of action needful in the future. As regards these statements of sickness and mortality only one other observation appears to be needful—the District under the superintendence of a Medical Officer of Health will often contain several parts evidently differing in their circumstances, or having very different rates of mortality, either from all causes, or of motality from some particular disease or class of diseases. The observation of these differences can scarcely fail to lead to valuable information, and it is in view of such differences that the tabular statements are required in Section 15 to be classified according to localities. and that provision for such a classification is made in the forms supplied for returns of deaths, In the absence of any ascertained differences of the above sort, it will still be Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1896. 85 ~ desirable to classify the deaths of the district according to the part of the district in which they occur; and for this purpose any areas of known population ma)' be taken as representing "localities" for purposes of the Order. Classification on this basis will be likely to lead to the discovery of real differences when the returns for several years can be compared together. The same considerations apply to the records of sickness (Table B). These records should be tabulated for every sanitary district; and it will be well, before proceeding to fill the columns and the blank spaces, to note carefully the headings and the footnotes. What has been said above with regard to the information which an annual report should contain must bo understood, not as suggesting that the report should be limited to these subjects, or that more detailed or differently arranged tabular statements may not be added but as indicating the sort of information required by the Board's Order. Many Medical Officers of Health will doubtless, with great advantage to the administration of their districts, furnish much more detailed information respecting particular questions to which they have been led by the circumstances of the foregoing years to devote attention, or in the investigation of which they may have arrived at valuable conclusions. Any information of this kind will be appreciated by the Local Government Board. (Signed) R. THORNE THORNE, Local Government Office, Medical Officer.
