CLE 5 THIRD ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF ST. JAMES & ST. JOHN, CLERKEN WELL. (For the Year 1858-9.) LONDON: BR1CKIIILLL & GREENWOOD, CONTRACT PRINTERS, NEWINGTON BUTTS 1860. THIRD ANNUAL REPORT of the VesteRy of the parish of ST. JAMES AND ST. JOHN, CLERKENWELL. In conformity with the provisions contained in the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 19 Vict. cap. 120, the Vestry have to report their proceedings for the year ending 25th March, 1859. The multifarious and onerous duties of the Vestry and their Committees having been fully set forth in former Reports, it may hero suffice to state that those duties and responsibilities, involving as they do the sanitary and general well-being of the parish, are deeply felt by the Vestry, and have constantly engaged their utmost attention and solicitude. During this period, Meetings have been held as follows :— Vestry Meetings, (General) 33 Do. (Special) 8 Finance Committee 16 Committee of Works 35 Assessment and Appeal Committee 9 Sanitary Committee 6 Special Committees on Sundry subjects 17 Total 124 4 Under the superintendence of the Committee of Works, and the Sanitary Committee, the following works have been carried out: SEWERS CONSTRUCTED.

This important question has during the past year received a solution. Her Majesty's Government, upon the representations of the Metropolitan Board of Works, introduced a Bill during the past Sessions, for amending the Metropolis Local Management Act, which Bill became law on the 2nd August, 1858. That Act gives the Metropolitan Board the power to execute such works for the improvement of the Main Drainage of the Metropolis as to them shall seem proper, without being required to submit their plans to the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's Works for approval, as 5 under the original Act. It also authorizes temporary works of deodorization, the expenses of which are to be paid out of the moneys raised by rates. To carry out this gigantic scheme, the Board are empowered to raise the sum of £3,000,000, with the consent of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, who are authorized to guarantee its repayment and interest. For the purpose of repaying the moneys so raised, the Board are empowered to levy in each year, during forty years from the passing of the Act, on the several parishes of the Metropolis, a Rate equivalent to 3d. in the pound on the annual value of the property rateable, estimated according to the basis of the County Rate, to bo paid into a public account in the Bank of England, in such sums and at such periods as the Board shall direct. Immediately on the passing of the Act, the Metropolitan Board proceeded to take into consideration the important works for which it provided, and directed that plans and specifications be prepared forthwith, for the execution of portions of the works, upon the principles of the scheme recommended by Messrs. Bidder & Hawksley, and their Engineer, Mr. Bazalgette. It is unnecessary here to enter into the details of the system of Main Drainage adopted, suffice it to say, that contracts were entered into as fast as practicable for the execution of portions of the works, which commenced on Hackney Common, on the 31st January last, and precepts were issued to the several Yestries and District Boards of the Metropolis for their first contributions, under the title of " The Metropolis Main Drainage Rate," that directed to this Yestry being dated 19th November, 1858. This precept required the sum of £2767 3s. as the amount due from Clerkenwell for the year 1859, payable on the 24th June, the same sum to be raised and paid annually at such periods as the Metropolitan Board shall direct. To meet this it was found necessary to make this rate of 4d. in the pound on the poor rate assessment of the parish, that being considerably below the County rato assessment, the basis of the rate. 4d. in the pound, however, producing a little in excess of the sum required, and the expenses of collection, 6 that excess will be carried to the credit of the account, and enable tho Vestry occasionally, (once in several years,) to reduce the rate to 3d. in the pound. THE ABOLITION OF THE METROPOLITAN TOLLS Is a question which has occupied considerable public attention, and the Vestry haying received a communication from the Royal Commissioners appointed to enquire into the matter and receive evidence thereon, dated 27th July, inviting any statement in reference thereto, which the Vestry might wish to make, such communication was referred to theFinance Committee, by whose recommendation a statement, suggested by Mr. Pascall, was forwarded to the Royal Commissioners in October, setting forth that about 30 years ago the Metropolitan Roads Commissioners caused the parish of Clerkenwell to be chargeable with the maintenance of the whole of its roads, including Pentonville-road, Bagnigge "Wellsroad, Goswell-road, and St. John-street-road, which were previously turnpike Roads and maintained by tolls. That the cost to the parishioners of repairing these roads ever since that period had been from 3d. to 6d. in the pound per annum, in consequence of the heavy wear and tear on them, (being the principal thoroughfares of the parish,) in addition to the cost of the streets and roads of the parish generally. That the parishioners of Clerkenwell having to bear this burthen for the benefit of traffic unconnected with the parish, it is exceedingly unfair and unjust that they should have to pay a toll immediately on entering the adjoining parishes of Islington, and St. Pancras, with a horse or vehicle in carrying on their trade. Also, that the parishioners having the burthen of these roads, were clearly entitled to the benefit of the possession of the old toll-house and garden at the bottom of the Pcntonville-road, which the Roads Commissioners had nevertheless retained to the present time A similar communication as far as relates to the toll-gate house was at the same time addressed to the Metropolitan Roads Commissioners, the result of which was that negociations were entered into between them and the Vestry for this property to be given up to the parish, and on agreement to this effect is being carried out. 7 An arrangement was also made to give evidence on the Abolition of the Metropolitan Toll question before the Royal Commissioners, and a Special Committee was appointed for this purpose, and to watch the question generally. Accordingly a Deputation attended the Commissioners on the 24th March last, and gave evidence thereon. (see appendix.) This important question is still pending, and receiving the careful attention of the Committee. Annexed is the Balance Sheet of the Vestry's Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 25th March, 1859, with Lists of Officers, &c. By Order, Robeet Pagei, Vestry Clerk.

APPENDIX, Extract from the Minutes of Evidence given before the Commissioners appointed to enquire as to the best means of affording relief to the Inhabitants of the Metropolitan Districts, 'within six miles of Charing Cross, by the Abolition of Turnpike Gates and Toll-Bars. Friday, March. 25th, 1859, Present.—Right Hon. Charles Viscount Eversley in the chair, Colonel the Hon. Edward Gordon Douglas Pennant, M.P., William Battie Wrightson, Esq., M.P. Mr. George Aldridge, Mr. Paget, Vestry Clerk; Mr. Boulter, Mr. Pierre Poley, Mr. William Hodson, and Mr. Eustace, are called in and examined as follows: 1781. (Chairman to Mr. Aldridge ) I believe you attend from Clerkenwell?—Yes. In introducing the deputation from Clerken well, I may state that we attend to express our opinion, as you are aware, in reference to the toll question. I hold in my hand a Report which was drawn up by the Deputation when they met in Committee, and submitted to the full Board last night. 1782. What Board do you allude to?—The Vestry Board of Clerkenwell. In this Report there is a resolution which was agreed to by the Committee, and submitted to the Board, who approved of it unanimously. Our clerk will just read the resolution, which embodies our views as nearly as possible, and I think it will be understood better than by my describing them. ( Mr Paget.") The resolution is as followsResolved, that this " Committee are of opinion that both the propositions submitted to the " Toll Commissioners are objectionable, and consider that the proper " course would be for each parish to maintain its own roads, as Clerken" wrell has done for nearly 30 years, particularly as such roads have " become public streets by being built upon on each side, and the houses "subjected to rates, which was the principle applied to Clerkenwell, " and which subjected the parish to the charge ; but in the event of "Royal Commissioners recommending that a tax be levied upon horses 19 " and carriages, the parish of Clerkenwell strongly urges its claim to its " proportionate share of such tax for the maintenance of roads formerly " Turnpike roads." The two propositions referred to, are those which have been urged upon the Commission by other deputations ; the first is for levying a Tax upon Horses, and the other is for levying something in the shape of a general rate over the district.Those are the propositions referred to. 1783. (Chairman to Mr. Aldridge). You have no turnpike road at present in the parish of Clerkenwell ?—We have no toll gates. 1784. Have you any turnpike roads?—We have roads which were formerly turnpike roads. 1785. Tou have no roads now which are repaired by tolls?—No. 1786. They are all repaired by the parish ?—By rate. 1787. Can you state how many miles of road you have in your parish ?—Not quite two and a half. 1788. Independently of streets?—Independently of streets. 1789. "What does it cost you to maintain those roads in repair?— About 2,212l. annually. (Mr. Boulter.) That is the cost of repairing the roads per annum on an average of 30 years. 1790. (Chairman.) Of course there is a very considerable traffic upon that road?—Yery great. 1791. (Chairman to Mr. Paget.) How many miles of paved street have you ?—About twenty. 1792. Can you at all state what the cost of repairing those streets is ?—A much smaller amount in proportion than it costs to repair the 2½ miles of road. It costs about 2,000l. per annum. The committee Btate in their Report, " This parish has nearly twenty miles of roads, " streets, and public places to maintain, including the highways, which "have cost, during the three years ending Christmas last, about the sum "of 12,557l., the greater portion of which has been absorbed by the "highways." 1793. How do you account for the streets costing so much less ?— There is comparatively little wear and tear on many of the streets of Clerkenwell. 1794. Are these paved streets, or only macadamized? — Partly paved and partly macadamized. 1795. You are referring to the 2½ miles formerly turnpike roads?— Yes. 20 1797. (Chairman to Mr. Aldridge.) The only suggestion you have to offer to the Commissioners is that, supposing the toll gates are removed, each parish should pay for the repair of its own roads ?—We have borne the whole expense of paving and repairing what were turnpike roads in Clerkenwell for the last twenty-nine years, receiving nothing from tolls. "We are willing to hear our burthen, provided all the other parishes are put on the same footing. We can scarcely step six yards out of Clerkenwell before we have to pay a toll in Islington. "We cannot get into either Islington or far into St. Pancras without paying a toll. 1797. (Mr. Wrightson.) Do you apprehend that the parish of Clerkenwell suffers at all from the existence of tolls in other parishes round the neighbourhood ?—I consider that they are great barriers to trade. Wherever there is a toll gate, house property is always worse on the other side of the gate. Builders always choose situations so as to avoid toll gates; and with regard to Islington, many persons would take the toll-gates into consideration, and would not go there. 1798. Do you consider that parish affected in any way as regards the price of coals by the operation of toll gates that intervene between you and the supply ?—I should not say that it is. 1799. Do you apprehend that the parish is injured by a want of free access to the country ?—I think it is. (Mr. Foley.) There would be no toll on coals which are delivered from the Great Northern railway. They come direct to us at Clerkenwell. We do not suffer with regard to the delivery of coals, but certainly, with regard to the delivery of goods, every tradesman in Clerkenwell suffers. 1800. (Mr. Wrightson.) Do you apprehend that you suffer with respect to the price of vegetables, or does it affect butcher's meat in any sort of way ?—The markets are within the tolls ; and with regard to vegetables, I think market gardeners are not liable for tolls. We are a large manufacturing population in Clerkenwell, and we deliver our goods round the suburbs, and so every tradesman suffers in the delivery of his goods round the suburbs of London. 1801. Would it not be worth while for the parish of Clerkenwell to submit to some small burthen for the sake of attaining those objects, provided that it was not too heavy ?—It would be manifestly unjust for Clerkenwell to submit to a burthen to support other roads, as I have said. In some respects we do suffer, but a tax would press more upon the parish of Clerkenwell now than the present tolls do. 1802. (Col. Pennant.) You would rather have the gates left as they are, than pay any additional tax ? Yes; more especially a horse tax, which would be more objectionable than a country rate, inasmuch as those persons who lived without the radius would have the use of all the roads without paying anything towards the repair of them. 21 1803. (To Mr. Aldridge.) Do you suppose that Clerkenwell has increased in value in consequence of the gates being abolished ?—I think that building ground has been covered on each side since the tolls have been done away with. 1804. Is there much ground unoccupied now for building? I can scarcely point to any. 1805. Do you think that the abolition of tolls in your parish has tended to the entire relief of the parish ? I do not think it has, because there are toll gates in Islington. Throughout Islington and St. Pancras, and I think almost throughout the six mile radius, the public roads have really become streets. Both of those parishes are very large, and in a better position to maintain their own roads than Clerkenwell is or ever has been. 1806. (To Mr. Eustace.) Do you know what is the assessable value in your parish?—197,000l. to the poor-rate. 1807. "What is the rate in the pound that you pay for highway rate, exclusive of lighting ?—The 2½ miles was kept quite separate from the other until the passing of the Local Management Act. Previous to that time for paving and lighting, exclusive of the 2i miles, our rates averaged 10d. in the pound. It was 10d., then it was 1s., and then it came down to 8d. The last rate that was made previous to the Local Management Act for maintaining, lighting and cleansing was 8d. in the pound. 1808. What has it been including the 2½ miles?—At one time the rate for the 2½ miles was 3d. and sometimes 4d. in the pound. There was a separate rate for the maintenance of the highways. 1809. Tou put it in two different sums ?—Yes. 1810. Altogether amounting to about 1s.? Rather over 1s. in the pound. 1811. Do you know how much of that goes to lighting?—The present lighting rate is about 4d. in the pound per annum. 1812. About 8d. in the pound is the actual sum for the repairs of your roads on an average ?—Roads and streets together; that is, cleansing and all. 1813. That includes watering, too, I suppose?—No, not watering; watering was always distinct. 1814. What is that in the pound?—"We did not water the whole parish; there were only parts that were watered. It was about 2½d. in the pound on the streets watered. 1815. Is that now merged in your other rate ?—Watering, lighting, cleansing, and paving the 2½ miles are now all merged into one sum. 22 1816. That is exactly 1s.?—The whole of it is now nearly 2s. in the pound for all the public roads; lighting, cleansing, watering, repairing, and such like. 1817. You say only 4d. of that 2s. goes towards lighting?—Yes. 1818. Then it is ls. 8d. in the pound for the repair, watering, cleansing, and so forth, of your roads?—There is the dusting to be taken out of that 1819. How much do you take out for that?—I should say that is about 1d.; not more than that. 1820. That still leaves 1s. 7d. for the repair of the roads ?—Yes. 1821. You think it amounts to that in the pound?—Yes, that is about it, for all the management of the road; that is the whole 20 miles, including the 2i miles of road. 1822. (Chairman.) Have you any paving done in the parish? —"We have at present. When the Local Management Act came into operation, we borrowed 5,000l, for the purpose of paving this 2½ miles of road, or as much as we could afford to do ; but the rates are so heavy, in addition to the poor rates, that we are compelled to go on very slowly with it. "We should be glad to pave them all if we could, but we have not the funds to do it. 1823. "What is the amount of your debt ?—About 4,000l. 1824. (Col. Pennant,) Have you not power to spread that over a number of years ?—Ten years. 1825. (Chairman.) "What interest do you pay ?—Five per cent. 1826. And your portion of the principal every year ?—Yes. (Mr. Paget.) 500l, a year. (Mr. Eustace.) "We are known to be heavily burthened in our parish, so I suppose we could not get the money on such good terms as other parishes. 1827. (Col. Pennant.) "What prevents you extending it over a greater number of years than ten ? Is it that you could not get money lent you?—(Mr. Eustace.) "We advertised, and we had only one response to the advertisement. We tried a second time, and we only had the same offer again, and we were compelled to come to the terms of the party who offered. With respect to the value of property on the line of road, we think that the property, instead of rising in value, is now depreciating. The noise and and turmoil are so great on these 2½ miles of highway, that the houses which three or four years ago let for about £28 a year are now let for 20l. They came to us to reduce the rates. Evidence was produced to us of the depreciation, and we had to reduce the rates in consequence of the value of these premises going down 23 1828. Is that owing to the increased traffic?—Yes. The traffic is so great that foot passengers will not go along it unless they are actually compelled. Ladies or that class of passengers will not go shopping. (Mr. Eustace.) For instance, a relative of mine, who is a retired tradesman, has actually left the road from the noise and dust, and gone to reside elsewhere. "We are compelled to be at great expense in watering our roads twice a day to keep down the dust to make the place at all habitable, otherwise we should suffer very severely in our rating. This is through traffic, and not traffic from which we benefit, but traffic coming from other parts and going to other parts of London. "We really derive no benefit from it whatever in our parish, so that we would impress as earnestly as we can on the Commissioners that in case anything like a general rating of any kind, either a tax on carriages or horses, or a county rate, or a district rate, that we are certainly fully entitled to receive our proportions for mileage along with the other parishes. Rates have been expended on the roads totally distinct from any parish account whatever, so that for all practical purposes there has been quite a distinct board kept up. That was previous to the Metropolitan Local Management Act. (Mr. Hodson.) It is also the opinion of the first-class shopkeepers in the immediate neighbourhood , that if these toll gates are removed it will increase their business 20 per cent, at least. 1829. (Chairman.) If the toll gates are removed which are now outside the boundary ?—Yes. (Mr. Aldridge.) I may state, in conclusion, as a general principle that we think it fair that each parish should pay for the repair of its own roads. The witnesses withdrew. Adjourned. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 1858. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, In the present, my third Annual Report, I shall endeavour to condense the weekly and fortnightly Reports, which I had the honour of laying before you from time to time, during the past year, with the addition of some remarks upon the present sanitary condition of the District, and a statement of the nuisances removed, and the improvements effected during the same period. There are three aspects in which the Sanitary state of a District may be viewed:—1st, in comparison with that of other Districts ; 2ndly, with that of the same District in former years ; 3rdly, in regard to its Sanitary capacity,—the standard being founded upon its general sanitary relations. I will test the mortality of the past year according to these principles. During the year 1858, the mortality of the entire metropolis was above the average ; the Registrar General tells us that the year 1858, was an unhealthy year. In Clerkenwell, the number of deaths was 1477, the average of the last 10 years being 1404 ; hence there was an excess of 73. According to the metropolitan death-rate, the excess of deaths would have been 94, so that the mortality of Clerkenwell is not so much above the average, as that of the metropolis. In 1856, the number of deaths in Clerkenwell was 1313; in 1857, 1406; so that the deaths were 64 more than in 1856, and 71 more than in 1857. The births, in 1858 were 2220; in 1856, 2179; and in 1857, 2219. During each year, a certain number of deaths of persons removed from the various districts of the metropolis, take place in General and Special Hospitals and Lunatic Asylums. The proportion of these belonging to Clerkenwell amounts to 105; the number for 1857 being 103, 26 The total number of deaths from Zymotic diseases, amounts (according to the old arrangement) to 336; that for 1857, being 348. The deaths from the principal zymotic diseases, were 285, against 295 in 1857, and 244 in 1856. These deaths are tabulated below, according to the respective years. 1856. SMALL POX. MEASLES.

These are the principal data in the mortality, to which I shall direct your principal attention ; the remainder will be found in the Tables at the end of the Report. It is interesting to find that the number of deaths from Zymotic diseases is less than last year- Deducting the number of deaths at and above 60, from (he total number of deaths, the Zymotic diseases amount to nearly 1/4th of the remainder. The short history of these diseases is, that some arise from infection or contagion, whilst others are generated amidst dirt, filth, and foul 27 air; in nearly all cases rendered fatal by the presence of decomposition in some form or another. It matters not what the source of the foul matters may be: whether arising from open privies or cesspools, refuse heaps, and the escape of drainage from decayed drains—by which the air is directly contaminated ; or from the presence of decomposing animal matter emanating from the bodies of over crowded human beings, and exhalations from dirty linen, bedding, and walls; the effect is the same, rendering infectious disease—to the infection of which no one should be unnecessarily exposed, entirely beyond the control of treatment, and eminently more infectious then they would otherwise be; and rendering all of them more fatal. The number of deaths from Typhus amounts to 31, to which must be added 8 which took place in the Fever Hospital. That for 1857 was 47, the number occurring in the Fever Hospital being 9 ; and that for 1856 being 52. Here is a decided diminution. If it were required to select one disease, most certainly indicating the unfavourable sanitary condition of a locality or district, it would be Typhus; hence we may conclude decidedly, that the general sanitary condition of Clerkenwell has been improved, during the past two years. Perhaps the money best spent by the Guardians of the Poor, is that devoted to at once removing patients suffering from Typhus, to the Fever Hospital. The large number of other deaths from Zymotic disease points to two most serious and intimately related evils existing in the District, viz.— those of over-crowding, and of entire families occupying a single room ; where these conditions exist, there is no possibility of preventing infection, nor of providing the sufferer with the amount of fresh air required for diluting a Zymotic poison, so as to prevent its fatal action. In thousands of instances in this District, living, cooking, sleeping, and dying, and the retention of the dead until buried, all go on in one room, the size of which is not more than one-fourth or one-fifth of that which it ought to possess, even omiting to allow for the space occupied by the furniture and the bodies of the occupants. And this evil is not at a stand-still, for very few new houses are built, these, moreover, being of the better class, not 'within the reach of the poor; and the population is increasing, even under its present undue mortality, at the rate of 800 a year. There seems to exist no inclination on the part of the Vestry to alter this state of things at present. Attention, however, has recently been drawn to it and the attendant evils, by Capt. Harris, the Assistant Commissioner of Police, who has shown the importance of placing all single rooms occupied by families, under the control of the Common Lodging Houses Act, which it is hoped will soon be done. 290 deaths arose from Consumptive diseases; the number in 1857 being 274. Many of these might probably be traced to 28 ment in an impure air, or in over-heated and ill-ventilated rooms, and insufficient out-of-door exercise. Among young women, also, many who formerly would have been brought up in service, enjoying good food, regular hours, and active exercise, are now employed in artificial flower making, fancy work, &e., under which circumstances they are ill-paid, ill-fed, over-confined, and finally become consumptive. Of the 294 deaths from diseases of the pulmonary organs, many must also be attributed to the low vitality produced by living in over-crowded or illventilated apartments. 142 deaths occurred in the "Workhouse: this number is rather less than that applying to the Metropolis in general, where, as the Registrar-General shows, 1 in every 11 deaths occurs in the Workhouse. Water Supply.— The Water-supply needs no special comment in regard to quality , but the old evils remain in respect to the quantity, viz: the one hour tap system, and the underground cisterns. The inhabitants of some of the courts are without water from Saturday evening until mid-day on the Monday following ! This is a terrible state of things. The water-supply is very deficient on the whole, as is the accommodation for washing and drying linen; this can never be thoroughly remedied until Baths and Wash-houses are established. If these could be supplied, the District would be benefited beyond measure; and there could be no excuse for the existence of the filthy state in which the linen of the poor is so often seen. • Cow Houses.—These still remain great and increasing nuisances. As the population is increasing, more cows and a greater amount of nuisance connected with their being kept in the district must necessarily be supplied. Great advantage would result from insisting upon the dung being removed between the hours of 10—12 at night and 6 in the morning. Slaughter Houses.—The condition of the Slaughter-houses has been on the whole good; 'the improvements required consisting simply in lime-whiting, repairing broken paving, and replacing broken or displaced traps. Yet it must be stated that a few of them are little more than make-shifts. Nuisances Removed, &c.—The works carried out in the removal of nuisances, and the improvement of the drainage of the district have been very considerable : 117 houses have been drained; 95 new drains laid; 171 cesspools destroyed, the privies being panned and trapped; 118 sewers cleansed, repaired, and re-paved; 332 gullies cleansed, repaired and trapped; 4 new gullies made; 4 air-shafts built; and 1124 feet of new sewers made, in King-street, Hallett's Place, Passing Alley, Wynyatt-street, Berkeley Court and St.. John's Lane. 29 In addition to these works, numerous minor improvements have been made: such as cleansing water-butts and cisterns, and providing lids; cleaning and lime-whiting houses; removing pigs and refuse, &c. and trapping drains. In regard to the cesspools alone, at a moderate computation, it may be considered that 256 square yards of surface of concentrated foul matter, pouring their offensive and noxious emanations into the very houses of the inhabitants, have been done away with. I wish I could congratulate the Vestry upon the foul effluvia generated within the dwellings from over-crowding having been removed to a like extent. It appears to me that the trapping of the gullies is not carried to a sufficient extent in the district; the effluvium from many of them is most offensive to passers by, and to the occupiers of the houses opposite which they are placed ; and it is no uncommon circumstance to observe paper or sacking laid over the gullies to keep the effluvium from the shops and houses. I must also remark that the removal of the refuse from the dust-bins is most imperfectly carried out. I have no intention of finding fault with the present contractor, for the same has been the case when the duty was in other hands. Your Clerk has explained to me the arrangement which is adopted, and it appears admirable ; but in practice it is most unsatisfactory, for into whatever house I go in the district, I find the dust-bin overloaded and often very offensive, and the occupants complaining that they cannot get the refuse removed. There appears to be something wanting in the whole system. Mostly the dwellings of the poor are let out in tenements, and it is no one's duty to give notice that the refuse requires removal, therefore it remains. Probably the real remedy would be found in directing the dustmen to apply regularly at the houses, at stated intervals, and not remain satisfied with simply passing through the streets. I have now reviewed the principal points to which I would direct your attention. The year on the whole has not been favorable, although the mortality most amenable to sanitary improvement has been diminished. The per centage mortality has been 2.2, whilst it should not exceed 1.7, so that, at the present rate, between 300 and 400 deaths occur annually beyond the due proportion. High mortality in a district, especially among the poor, who are the principal sufferers, does not relate simply to the dead; the living are also deeply concerned., Consider the waste of time and consequent loss of income to the parents or friends arising from the preliminary attendance, the funeral and the burial. Every death in a poor family causes an interruption to the ordinary remunerative labor, and produces expenses which have to be paid out of scanty wages, often 30 barely sufficient to maintain the family; hence the living suffer from want, the parish funds must he appealed to, families become parentless, and next comes crime. Besides, not only is the trouble and expense of attending upon fatal illness to be considered, but also that connected with maladies which are cured, to be taken into account, and which does not enter into the mortality tables. That the mortality of Clerkenwell is less than in some other districts of the metropolis may strikingly be shewn by its comparison with that of Newington, in which the population is almost exactly the same as that of Clerkenwell, but with the advantage of being spread over nearly double the number of acres of ground. The average mortality of Newington during the last ten years is 1701, that of Clerkenwell being 1404—an excess of nearly 300 deaths; in 1858 the deaths in the former district being 1764, and in Clerkenwell 1478. Butitmust beremembered that the population of Clerkenwell is rapidly increasing ; that numerous offensive businesses, with their train of poor, and nuisances, are being brought into the District,—even the very foot-way is becoming converted into shops; and that drunkenness prevails to an alarming extent; consequently the better classes, who suffer least mortality, are leaving the District, their houses being occupied and overcrowded by the poor. Hence the future sanitary prospects of Clerkenwell, cannot be considered as favourable. It is to be hoped however, by unremitting attention to the still further improvement of the Drainage of the District, the diminution or removal of the various nuisances, the distribution of the crowded inhabitants, the provision of a far greater supply of water, and efficient places for the purification of linen &c. to that the mortality may ultimately be brought to the proper standard; for surely Clerkenwell has natural advantages which should place it foremost in a sanitary point of view among the Districts of the metropolis. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, October, 1859. J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D. Deaths Regisetered in Clerkenwell in 1858. Deaths Registered in Clerkenwell in 1868. Death.
