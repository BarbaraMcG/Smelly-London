To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors, L—INTRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Fifty-Fourth Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of the -Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District of St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since 185(5, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1900, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last mentioned date have been great. Changes were made in 1900, at the census of 1901, and again in 1906, when the two southern Sub-Districts were amalgamated. So that now the four Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras, except for slight deviations of the outer boundary, coincide with the four Parliamentary Divisions. CENSUS. The time is fast approaching for taking another decennial census, and the Bill to be introduced into Parliament for this purpose is under consideration. METEOROLOGICAL RECORDS. Here follow the Meteorological Records for the year, as deduced from observations made at Greenwich and at Camden Square. 11 METEOROLOGICAL TABLE FOR LONDON, 1909. {Extracted front the Annual Summary of the Registrar-General.)

The Notification of Births Act, 1907, came into operation on 9th March, 1908. Primarily, the duty of notifying a birth to the Medical Officer of Health devolves upon the father of the child if he be resident in the bouse at the time of its occurence; secondarily, upon any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth. The notice must be given by posting a prepaid letter or post card within 36 hours after the birth, or by delivery of a written notice of the birth at the office of the Medical Officer of Health within the same time. The local authority must supply, without charge, addressed and stamped post cards containing the form of notice to any medical practitioner or midwife residing or practising in their area who applies for the same. The notification is in addition to and not in substitution for the requirements of the Act relating to the registration of births, and it applies to any child born after the expiration of the 28th week of pregnancy, whether alive or dead. Liability to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings is incurred by any person who fails to give notice of a birth unless there is reasonable ground to believe that notice has been duly given by some other person. 24 THE ST. PANCRAS PREVENTIVE SCHEME. The St. Pancras preventive scheme of infantile mortality is briefly as follows:— 1. Notification of Births.—From these are selected the most suitable cases to visit, commencing with the poorest houses in the poorest streets. 2. Advice Cards to Mothers.—A copy of the Advice Card is sent to the mother of every newly-born child as soon as the birth is notified. Supplies of these cards are also sent to medical practitioners, hospitals, dispensaries, and midwives for distribution. 3. Medical Advice.—In cases where mothers arc suffering from disease they are referred to doctors, hospitals, and dispensaries, and where mothers are in need of extra food and milk to continue breast feeding, they are referred to religious and charitable organisations, and especially to the St. Pancras School for Mothers. During the year, as previously, the work of the Woman Inspector in advising expectant mothers and in correcting defective and improper feeding has been supplemented by assistance received from a number of lady voluntary visitors. The St. Pancras Mothers' and Infants' Society, supported by voluntary contributions and voluntary workers, with its SCHOOL FOR MOTHERS at 37, Chalton Street, Somers Town, supplements the municipal work, and is doing a great good in the southern part of the Borough. On the 4th September, 1909, the Local Government Board issued an Order with respect to the qualification, duties, &c., of Health Visitors under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which enpowers the Borough Councils to appoint suitable women for the purpose of giving to persons advice as to the proper nurture, care and management of young children, and the promotion of cleanliness. The Act of 1908 enables the County Council to pay out of the County Fund any sum by way of contribution towards the salary of a Health Visitor appointed under the regulations not exceeding in any case one-half the amount. 25 ACTION TAKEN DURING THE YEAR.

During the year 1909 of 5,238 live births registered 3,826, or 73½per cent. were notified within 36 hours, that is to say, nearly three-fourths of the live births were promply notified, and in addition 135 still births. The sending of cautionary letters in cases where there lias been omission to notify is having the effect of bringing the notifications in earlier. The effects upon the infantile mortality has been as follows:— In 1904 = 151.6 deaths of infants per 1000 births. „ 1905 = 135.7 „ 1906 = 131.1 „ 1907 = 113.8 „ 1908 = 115.0 „ 1909 = 108.8 THE POSITION OF ST. PANCRAS. The summers of 1907, 1908, and 1909 were cold summers, and the St. Pancras method of prevention was not put to the test of comparison with other boroughs and towns in the third quarter of the year. It was in this hot quarter of the year that St. Pancras did so well by comparison in lowering the mortality, as shown by the three years 1904, 1905, and 1906, especially in the last and hottest year of the three. When it is called to mind what a large proportion of infant mortality is caused by summer diarrhoea and other diseases due to improper feeding in the hot weather, it is apparent that the principal test of the value of a system of saving infant life by breast-feeding is the total mortality in the third or summer quarter of the year. The prevalence of measles exerts its main effect in the second and fourth quarters, and cold in the presence of poverty, which connotes insufficient clothing and warming, in the first or winter quarter of the year, and prematurity more or less all the 3'ear round. The Quarterly and Annual position of merit of St. Pancras, compared to London Boroughs and the 76 large towns, for the years 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1909 in regard to Infantile Mortality:— 29 London Boroughs. 1st Qr. 2nd Qr. 3rd Qr. 4th Qr.

Mr. Burns replied. The following tables give the information asked for : — I.—Iutant Mortality in each of the years 1904 to 1908. — Deaths under one year to 1000 births in the years— 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 England and Wales 145 128 132 118 121 76 great towns, including London 160 140 145 127 129 London 145 130 131 116 113 142 smaller towns 154 132a 138 122 124 England and Wales, less the 218 125 1136 116 106 110 towns 28 II.— Infant Mortality in the First Nine Months of each of the Years 1904 to 1909. — Deaths under one year to 1000 births in the first three quarters of each of the years— 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 England and Wales 149 131 135 113 115 106 76 great towns, including London 165 142 148 118 123 114 London 149 129 133 110 110 104 42 smaller towns 157 136a 140 118 117 107c England and Wales, less the 218 towns 127 116b 117 101 105 97d a, 141 small towns; b, less 217 towns; c, 143 small towns ; d, less 219 towns. On Tuesday, March 1st, 1910, Mr. Vivian, in the House of Commons, asked the President of the Local Government Board how many local authorities had adopted the Notification of Births Act, and what diminution in the infant death-rate, under one year, had taken place. Mr. Burns wrote in reply : The Act is now in force in 195 areas of local government — namely, (1) the whole of the administrative County of London, comprising the City of London and the 28 Metropolitan Boroughs ; (2; 40 County Boroughs ; (3) 4(i Non-County Boroughs; (4) 57 Urban Districts; (5) 17 Rural Districts. In the case of 4 Non-County Boroughs, 7 Urban Districts, and 16 Rural Districts the Act is in force by virtue of its adoption by the Worcestershire County Council. After giving a list of the various areas which have adopted the Act the Right Honourable Gentleman proceeded : The death-rates of infants during the first year of life published by the Registrar-General for England and Wales show that the figures for the years 1907, 1908, and 1909 were lower than in any previous year recorded, being 118, 120, and 109 respectively per 1000 births. The lowest corresponding figure in any previous year was 128 in 1905. The following is a copy of Advice Card to Mothers revised to date:— ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Pubi.tc Health Department. ADVICE TO THE MOTHER. It is found;— (1) That a large number of infants are born before full time and diesoon after birth, or are born so feeble as to live only a few weeks. This is mainly due to want of health and stamina in the parents, especially in the mother. 29 (2) That a large number of infants are not suckled at the breast after being born, or are suckled at the breast only for a few weeks, and are weaned too early. This is due either to the want of stamina in the mother or to want of knowledge. Experience shows : — (3) That the hand-feeding of infants is generally unsatisfactory, always risky, and in the summer dangerous and often fatal. (4) That it is cheaper and easier to feed infants by the breast than by the hand; (5) That it is simpler and wiser for the mother to take care of her health, both before and after the birth of her infant, and to improve her breast milk, than to bring up her baby by hand feeding, wholly or in part. (6) That if the mother's health and stamina are maintained the infant can be breast-fed for the natural nine months and grow into a robust child. In these circumstances all mothers are advised to practise and spread a knowledge of the following system Mothering. The health of the mother is most important of all. The mother must take care of her health so as to make her infant strong at birth, prepare herself to suckle her baby, and pay particular attention to the nipples. Spirits and strong drink must be avoided ; plenty of good, plain, wholesome, nourishing food must be eaten, and the appetite improved by exercise in the open air. A mother who improves her own health will also improve that of her baby. When in doubt as to her health and habits a mother should not hesitate to seek medical advice at once. Suckling. A mother who has properly taken care of her health should be able to fully suckle her baby when born. She should not be disappointed if the breast milk is scanty or not fully established for two or three days. The regular suckling of the baby will cause the flow to increase more and more. If she continues to take care of her health she should be able to continue suckling her baby for about nine months. The best food for the baby is mother's breast milk alone and without any other food whatever. If the mother's milk is poor in quality she should improve it by eating a greater quantity of good, plain, wholesome food, and improve her appetite by more exercise in the open air, and, above all, a mother should avoid spirits and strong drink. 30 If the mother has not enough milk the same measures will increase tin quantity, and a cupful or two of milk half-an-hour before suckling will he an excellent help towards this, as the only way to humanise cow's milk is to pass it through the mother and not through a machine. In many cases a cupful or two of liquid food such as cocoa or soup should always he taken shortly before suckling; even hot water is better than no liquid at all. The nipples should be cleansed and dried each time after suckling, and the baby's mouth should be kept clean. The baby should be suckled every two hours during the first three months, gradually decreasing to every three hours during the following months. The baby should be awakened for this purpose, if .necessary. Also twice in tinnight during the first month, once during the second month, and in the third month night feeding should be gradually discontinued. As the feeds are reduced in number the quantity of milk at each feed naturally increases. Feed the baby slowly : allow fifteen minutes or more for each meal. Do not rock the baby violently after it is fed. Do not feed the baby when it cries between meal-times. Never give a " dummy comforter" to the baby. Weaning. The usual time for weaning is about the ninth month. Weaning becomes easier and safer if it is delayed until after the ninth month, soon after which the breast milk should be altogether stopped. Breast feeding should not be continued after the 12th month. Not until the eighth or ninth month, and until the first front teeth are cut, is a baby able to eat and digest floury foods, such as baked flour, powdered biscuit, small crumbled bread, and fine oatmeal, and these foods should never be given to a baby before that time. Never give the baby soothing syrups, teething powders, patent medicines, patent foods. On no account should portions of the ordinary food or drink of the mother when at meals be given to the baby, they may prove injurious and even fatal. Weaning before Time. A mother should not wean her baby before the seventh month at the very earliest, as weaning before time is dangerous to the baby. Every effort should be made to put of weaning until after the hot weather has come and gone, as the months of July, August, and September are particularly fatal to hand-fed babies. If the health of the suckling mother or of the baby is failing, a Doctor's advice should be sought with a view to avoiding: weaning. If the health of the mother or the breast milk cannot be improved and the Doctor considers that the baby must be weaned or partly hand-fed, then it should be taken regularly to the Doctor for advice as to the proper food and feeding. A hand-fed baby's progress should be very carefully watched, and if it appears to be ailing or does not thrive medical advice should be immediately sought, especially if there be any diarrhoea, as illness in a baby develops rapidly and is soon past remedying. 31 Advice, Instruction, and Information. 1.—Medical advice can be obtained by a mother from her private Doctor, or at the various provident dispensaries, hospitals, or other public medical charities, according to her means. 2.—Instruction in motherhood may be obtained, and babies may be weighed at the " Mothers' and Babies' Welcome," 37, Chalton Street, Euston Road, N.W. 3.—Information in reference to health visitors, and the home instruction of Mothers and advice as to mothering, suckling, and weaning, may be obtained from the Women Inspectors, to whom messages may be addressed, at the Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. John F. J. Sykks, Medical Officer of Health. (On back;.) Special Spring and Summer Notice. Babies born after the beginning of April should continue to be Soi.ei.y Brkast-Fkd until the end of September at least, otherwise they run a serious risk during the hot weather of dying from Diarrhoea. [On back.) Winter Notice. Tough, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and other Chest complaints of Babies are best prevented by clothing the Baby with a long-sleeved woollen undervest, and when out of doors by well covering the neck, arms, and legs.

The School for Mothers established by the St. Pancras Mothers'and Infants' Society in Somers Town in the Spring of 1907 has now been in existence three years, and has fully justified its existence in excellently supplementing and carrying to a logical conclusion the principle of instructing and helping the mother as the agent for the prevention of infantile mortality. At the Institution known as the "Welcome" at 37, Chalton Street, Euston Road, N.W., a series of activities in "mothercraft" are energetically carried on, much to the benefit of the newly-born and the young, who when neglected at an early age arc so prone to become physically unfit. It is commencing the prevention of physical deterioration at an earlier age even than the medical inspection of school children. The municipal and philanthropic scheme under the guidance of the Medical Officer of Health and a Woman Sanitary Inspector works on the following lines:— 32 Notifications of expectancy from public institutions. Notification of births from persons present. To the Medical Officer of Health. General Advice Cards to Mothers. Health Visitors' attentions to poorer class Mothers. Fathers—Wage earners. Mothers — Well- informed, healthy and thrifty. Infants — Brtast-fed. Referred to School for Mothers Superintendent. Referred to various other co-operating agencies. Revisited from time to time till weaning. All going well. Revisited at weaning. Medical Division. Periodical consultation and weighing. Referred by Medical Officer to Provident Division. Doctor or Midwife. Baby clothes, etc. Extra help and extra nourishment during confinement. School Division. Periodical instruction in • the arts of motherhood at the School and at home.

Sir, The work done during the year 1909, with regard to the attempts to lessen infant mortality, has been carried on mainly on the same general linesas fully described in my five previous reports. In accordance with vour wishes, natural feeding for infants, Up to about 9 months of age, has been our watchword, and the principle chiefly instilled, both in the written and verbal advice given to the mothers, both from the Town Hall and from the School for Mothers. Last year (1908), in order to assist in a special widespread inquirv suggested by the Home Office (on the subject of the employment, &c., of women, both before and after the birth of the child), every single home where a birth had occurred, in the particular district of Somers Town included in Ward VI. (East), was visited, and the mother and baby having been seen an Inquirv form was filled in. This first visit was paid when the baby was from 6 weeks to 8 weeks of age, as soon as possible after the birth had been registered (since the Early Notification of Births was not in force in St. Pancras at the beginning of the year 1908, when the Home Office Inquiry was started). Then during the year 1909 each of these homes was again visited, on or within a few days of the day that the baby was 12 months old, so that as complete a history as possible might be ascertained of the first year of life. In many instances intermediate visits had been paid, so that the progress of the little one might be watched where danger was likely to arise, either from the ill-health of the mother or baby or from the poverty-stricken condition of the home. At the final visit at 12 months it was found, as expected, that in many cases the family had removed; and though in some instances of these removals the baby was able to be traced, yet in others no clue could be obtained. A brief summary of these births visited in Ward VI. is as follows :— Births occurring during 1908 in Ward YI. 077 " Removed" at primary visit 4.5 " Not known " at primary visit 24 " Removed" at final visit (at 12 months) 184* " Dead " within the 12 months 68‡ Complete history (during the 12 months) obtained 3566 Of those found "removed" at final visit many details had previously been obtained. ‡There may have been other deaths amongst those who were not traced at final visit. A full report of the Home Office Inquiry, with four Summary Tables, and details on working sheets is herewith appended. 38 Voluntary Visitors. This year, as previously, the work of the Public Health Department in regard to the lessening of infant mortality and all the clerical work consequent upon the Notification of Births Act has been usefully supplemented by means of a number of fully qualified women-workers (from the National Health Society, Bedford College, the Royal Sanitary Institute, etc.,) who were desirous of gaining practical experience in St. Pancras. All those who applied to come, and who were deemed suitable, worked enthusiastically and sympathetically; and when they left here to fulfil other duties always expressed themselves most grateful for the kindness and help they had received and the experience they had gained. It seems, however, that the benefits received were mutual, as much good work was done for the Public Health Department without involving any expense. Miss Muirhead and Miss Day, who had also worked here during the latter part of 1908, left in the early part of 1009 to act as Sanitary Inspectors at the City (temporary) and Yarmouth respectively. Miss F. Anderson and Miss Houghton left in order to further qualify themselves by examinations of the Sanitary Inspectors' Examination Board and Central Midwives' Board respectively. Miss Spong and Miss Allen went to take up duties in connection with the Children's Act at Edmonton. The Misses Edith and Mabel Rintoul, for personal reasons, did not wish to continue Public Health Work; and Miss Petty was appointed at the St. Pancras School for Mothers to carry out some original Cookery investigations in the homes, and also to act as Assistant. Superintendent. Mode of Visiting. During the year 1909 babies were systematically visited at both an earlier and a later age than had been done previously—earlier, because the Early Notification of Birth gave us the necessary information much sooner than the Registrar's Returns had done; and later, because, in accordance with the request of the Home Office, a visit was paid to the infant on completion of the twelfth month. Though by the Notification of Births Act the birth was generally notified within 36 hours, yet neither the voluntary visitors nor myself would visit a mother until the baby was over 10 days old (by which time the Doctor or Midwife would probably have discharged the case) unless we were specially asked to do so by the Doctor or Midwife attending. Number of Births, Visits, &c. Total births (excluding still births) registerd (majority within two months) 5237 Births (including still births*) notified, (majority within 30 hours) 3961 Still births notified, 135. 39 Advice Curds sent to eases notified within 36 hours on day of receipt of notification. (N.B.—Not sent for still births) 3826 Advice Cards sent to cases registered (but not notified) on the receipt of Registrar's returns 1377 Caution Letters sent to cases registered but not notified re births occurring since January 1st, 1909 1252 Visits. Total number paid. 2207 Actual number of infants visited 880 Additional visits to infants‡ 1327 ‡Of these—Infants " not known " at address given 2 „ Infants " removed " from address given 152 Extra visits paid by myself to Hospitals, Doctors, Midwives, Nurses, Creches, Maternity Missions, Almoners, Relieving Officers, Workhouses, Infirmary Employment Exchange, Distress Committee Office, School for Mothers, C.O.S., National Health Society, Royal Sanitary Institute, &c. 338‡ ‡This number would have been considerably higher if it could have included all the " visits " which had perforce for press of work and lack of time to be replaced by letters and interviews at the Town Hall. Notification of Births. The Notification of Births Act which came into force in St. Paneras in March, 1908, has thus been in vogue during the whole of the year 1909. The numbers of notifications, still births, &c., for 1908 and 1909 arc not comparable, as they refer in the former case to a period of 9 months oidy, and in the latter to a period of 12 months. Since the beginning of the year 1909, cautionary letters have been sent to the fathers (or persons in attendance) of those infants whose births were registered but not notified, and by this means the knowledge of the Act has become more widespread. The Hospitals and Midwives seem to notify their eases very regularly, but it is probable that some of the private practitioners omit to remind the husbands of their patients of this duty. Illegitimacy. Of the total births registered (5,237) the illegitimate births registered numbered 216, i.e., 4.1 per cent. The remarks in the last year's report to you re illegitimate births and the deaths of illegitimate infants apply equally now. Clerical Work. The amount of clerical work continues to increase year by year. As before complete and current indexes have been kept of all the births registered and of all the registered infant deaths. All the clerical work consequent upon the notification of births has been carried on in the same way as during last year and, in addition, each week cautionary letters have been sent to every case where a birth has been registered but not notified. If a birth is neither registered nor notified, then the Public 40 Health Department can have no knowledge of it. For the first time this year complete entries have been made each week of births (with St. Pancras addresses) occurring in Institutions outside St. Pancras (e.g. Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, British Lying-in Hospital (Endell Street), Middlesex Hospital, etc.), and these numbered 532. Many of these notifications were duplicated, so much care was required to ensure that the correct number of entries was made. Weekly reports have been submitted to you as to the number of notifications, the titles of notificants, and attendants; also quarterly reports as to the number of births notified, registered, and visited, etc. It is a matter for regret that so much time has to be spent upon clerical work, that in consequence the more vital home-visiting, etc., has to be somewhat neglected. Infant Mortality. The infant mortality rate, which (when estimated on the same basis of infant deaths per 1000 births, exclusive of still births) in 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907 and 1908, was respectively 152, 136, 131, 114 and 115, was 109 in 1909. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, Blanche Gardiner, Sanitary Inspector. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST. PANCRAS HOME OFFICE INQUIRY--1908 AND 1909. SHORT EXPLANATORY NOTES. Area of Inquiry was Ward VI., of Easf St. Pancras, thus including the poorest part of the Borough (viz., Somers Town) :— Every baby born and registered during 1908 in this Ward was visited, and, the mother and baby having been seen, an Inquiry Form was filled in as far as was possible At the first visit the baby was from 6 to 8 weeks old; and while intermediate visits were frequently paid, the final visit was on or within a few days of the child being 12 months old. Births occurring during 1908. in Ward VI. (St. Pancras) 677 Of these " Removed " or "Not Known " at primary visit 69 ,, "Removed" at final visit at 12 months 184* „ Dead within 12 months 68‡ ,, Surviving the first year 356 *Of those found " removed " at final visit some details had previously been collected. These have been entered from the Inquiry Forms separately on to the Working Sheets, but they were too incomplete to be summarised on the Sheets I. and II. (A., B. & C ) ‡There may have been other deaths amongst those who were not able to be traced at final visit. •11 Only those who have actually visited the cases and tilled in the Home Office Inquiry Forms can fully appreciate the difficulties involved in filling in the Working Sheets and Summary Tables. The personal equation plays an important part, not only of the personality of the visitor, but also that of the mother visited. Midwives, Health Visitors and C.O.S. Workers look at things from different points of view and with different eyes; while as to the mothers, some could give exact and definite information, others were somewhat inconclusive, while with others it was felt that what they said was not necessarily true at all. (See also pp. 74 and 75 of the Proceedings of the Infant Mortality Congress, 1908 ) Re Industrial Employment of Mothers.—On the original Inquiry Forms this was sub-divided into industrial employment before present pregnancy, during present pregnancy, and after birth; whereas on the Working Sheets and Summary Tables " industrially employed " had no definite period-signification. The Working Sheets and Summary Tables have often therefore been sub-divided into (a) During this pregnancy and (b) After birth; but the two main divisions into which all the cases were grouped were :— (1) Mothers never "industrially employed" at all, either during pregnancy or after birth. (2) Mothers " industrially employed" for any time whatsoever, either during pregnancy or after birth or both. By " industrially employed " we have understood any sort of employment at ail, that is for gain, whether at home, or in factory, or workshop, or elsewhere. Hut it must be remembered, that the majority of these St. Pancras mothers have irregular and uncertain employment, such as odd days charing, washing, cleaning : also that the period of employment varies very considerably, sometimes for a part of a week only, sometimes for a whole week. When the father is " out of work " the mother will get work, but when the father is " in work" the mother will stay at home. (Moral- Regular work and good wages for the father should be the aim of those people who wish mothers to stay at home and tend the baby.) From the Summary Table I. (of " cases under inquiry ") it is seen that out of 414 cases of infants the mother was not "industrially employed" at all in 300 cases; and " industrially employed," and this only to a very varying extent, in only 114 cases; therefore St. Pancras may be regarded as useful in the widespread Home Office Inquiry, at least as a control and comparison. 42 Inquiry as to Industrial Employment of Married Women and Infant Mortality (1908).

And in the case of 46 mothers, out of a total of 300 mothers not industrially employed, there had been previous miscarriages and still births. For the total number of miscarriages and still births among these mothers see Summary, Table I., " Cases under Inquiry." 46 In addition to the foregoing there were 217 infants removed before twelve months, viz. :— 1. 33 infants whose mothers were industrially employed either (a) during pregnancy or (b) after birth, or both. 2. 184 infants whose mothers were not industrially employed either (a) during pregnancy or (b) after birth. Note.— The dates of removal of these cases was not ascertainable, as the final visits were paid at the end of the first year of age of the infant, that is, during 1909, and the earlier visits were paid in the earliest months of the first year of age. So that in most cases the intervals between the visits were very long, other duties not permitting of frequent visits being made. III.—INFECTIOUS DISEASES. § DISCOVERY AND DIAGNOSIS. It is well to know that unrecognised cases largely spread infectious diseases. Discovery.—Mild cases of indisposition or disease excite no particular attention, or are attributed to other than the real cause by parents, guardians, or friends, and are not submitted to medical examination. In the autumn there are generally several instances of parents and guardians failing to recognise as infectious cases of slight disturbances of health in children until other children become infected and develop typical symptoms. When cases of suspected infectious diseases occur there is sometimes considerable difficulty and delay in making an exact medical diagnosis in certain types of the disea-es. Here bacteriological and additional clinical examinations are brought to bear upon doubtful types, and to check or confirm the diagnosis. Bacteriological Tests.—The number of specimens of secretion, blood and sputum submitted to bacteriological tests during the year in suspected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, and the results of examination were as follows :— Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Diphtheria (Secretion) 29 . . 61 90 Reaction obtained. Doubtful. Reaction not obtained. Total. Typhoid (Blood) 9 . . 15 24 47 Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Tuberculosis (Sputum) 16 . . 64 80 Infectious Diseases full into several categories— (a) Permanent eompulsorily certifiable diseases. (b) Permanent voluntarily certifiable diseases, e.g., consumption. (c) Temporary compulsorily certifiable diseases, e g., chicken-pox when small-pox is present. (d) Non-certifiable diseases — (i.) Diseases notifiable by School Teachers, e.g., measles, whooping cough, mumps, tonsillitis. (ii.) Communicable Disorders notifiable by School Teachers, e.g., ophthalmia (blight), ringworm, impetigo, scabies, pediculosis. (iii.) Suspicious Symptoms, e.g., sore throat, feverish cold, whooping, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, etc. 48 f 2- NOTIFICATION AND DISEASES.

This matter was considered by tlie Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health in 1906, and it was decided that it was undesirable to take any steps to remove erysipelas from the list of notifiable diseases. 53 The following table of information obtained from Metropolitan Medical < )fficers of Health shows how easily each city and borough could act as its own clejring-house. If medical certificates of the notifiable infectious diseases were sent by the medical staffs of public hospitals and dispensaries to the Medical Officer of Health of the city or borough in which the institutions are situated, instead of being sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the city or borough in which the patient resided or resides, and the Medical Officer of Health were required to forthwith forward such certificates to the Medical Officer of Health of the city or borough in which the patient resided or resides, having extracted such information as he may require, several advantages would be obtained. Firstly, the medical staffs of public hospitals and dispensaries would be spared the (to them) difficulties and worries of finding the situation of the patient's residence in order to ascertain the Medical < )fticer of Health to whom the certificate should be sent; secondly, the Medical Officer of Health would at once know what was taking place with regard to infectious disease in the institutions of his borough, and in accordance with the present practice (as a variable number of certificates of cases residing elsewhere are now sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the borough in which the institution is situated and have to be forwarded to another Medical Officer of Health), the contents of the certificate would be immediately telephoned to the Medical Officer of Health of the borough of the patient's residence and the certificate immediately sent 011 by post. With regard to payment, this could be easily adjusted by one borough reclaiming from another borough the few shillings or pounds disbursed for in- or out-patients of public hospitals and dispensaries not resident in the borough where the institution is situated. 54 CERTIFICATES OF COMPULSORILY NOTIFIABLE DISEASES.

Extracts from Memorandum on Cerebro-Spinal Fever, issued by the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board in July, 1905, were quoted in the Annual Report for 1906.

Consumption.—The scheme for the voluntary notification of consumption—a disease which is the cause of more suffering and death than the whole of the compulsory notifiable infectious diseases—came into operation at the beginning of 1906. Local Authorities have power to put into operation a scheme of this character without the consent of the Local Government Board, and to pay a' reasonable fee for each notification. The Borough Council decided to pay to each medical practitioner the same fee as is allowed for notifications under the Infectious Diseases Clauses of the Public Health Act, namely, two shillings and sixpence if the case occurs in his private capacity, and one shilling if the case occurs in his practice as medical officer of any public body or institution. Each notification received is treated as confidential, and nothing is done to prejudice the patient's occupation or employment. Advice papers are sent in all cases notified. By an Order dated the 18th December, 1908, the Local Government Board, in pursuance of Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended and extended by the Public Health (London) Actt 1891, and the Public Health Act, 1896, have provided for the notification to the medical officers of health of sanitary authorities of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (phthisis or consumption) occurring amongst the inmates of Poor Law Institutions, or amongst persons under the care of district (Poor Law) medical officers. The Order came into operation on the 1st January, 1909. The most important provisions of the Order are as follows :— By Article IV. the medical officer of a Poor Law Institution must, within forty-eight hours of recognising symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in the case of a poor person who is an inmate of the Institution, notify the case to the medical officer of health of the sanitary district in which the person resided immediately before he became an inmate of the Institution. Article V. directs similar notification to be made in cases where a district medical officer recognises the disease in persons attended by him (i.e., out-relief patients), according to his agreement with the Guardians. Under Article VI. the superintending officer of a Poor Law Institution must notify the medical officer of health of the actual or intended place of destination and address at that place of any person leaving the institution in respect of whom a notification has been received. Article VII. directs that a relieving officer must notify changes of patients' addresses to the medical officer of health of the district to which such person may move. By Article VIII. notifications directed under the Order are to be paid for by the sanitary authority. The remuneration allowed to medical officers of a Poor Law Institution or a district medical officer will be at the rate of one shilling for 57 every notification, and in the ease of a superintending officer of a Poor Law Institution or a relieving officer at the rate of threepence for ever}: notification, but where in relation to one and the same case two or more notifications have been sent by a Poor Law medical officer to one and the same medical officer of health his remuneration will be sixpence for every notification after the first. Article IX. provides that nothing in the regulations shall have effect so as to apply or to authorise anyone to put in force with respect to a person in relation to whom a notification has been made any enactment which renders him, or any other person, liable to a penalty, or subjects him to any restriction, prohibition, or disability affecting him or his employment, ocaupation, means of livelihood, or residence on the ground of his suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Subject to this qualification a sanitary authority, on the advice of their medical offieer of health, may, in the case of a poor person notified as suffering from this disease :— 1. " Take all such measures or do all such things as are authorised " in any case of infectious disease, or of dangerous infectious " disease, by any enactment relating to public health, and as " have reference to the destruction and disinfection of infected " articles or the cleansing or disinfecting of premises ; 2. " Take all such measures or do all such things as are appropriate " and necessary for the safe disposal or destruction of infectious " material, produced and discharged, as a result of pulmonary " tuberculosis, and otherwise for the prevention of the spread " of infection from any such material; 3. *' Afford or supply all such assistance,, facilities, or articles as " within such reasonable limits as the circumstances of the case " require and allow, will obviate or remove or dimish the risk " of infection arising from the conditions affecting the use or " occupation of any room when used or occupied by the poor " person as a sleeping apartment; and 4. " Furnish for the use of the poor person, on loan or otherwise, " any appliance, apparatus, or utensil which will be of assistance " for the purpose of any precaution against the spread of infee" tion." The sanitary authority, on the advice of their medical officer of health, may provide and publish or distribute in the form of placards, handbills or leaflets, suitable summaries of information and instruction respecting pulmonary tuberi culosis, and the precautions to be taken against the spread of infection from that disease. The Order was set out fully in Part VI., § 3, of the Annual Report for 1908. As a large proportion of the voluntary notifications formerly received were Poor Law cases, the great majority are now compulsory notifications under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908. Each notification received is treated as confidential, and nothing is done toprejudice the patient's occupation or employment. Advice papers are sent in all cases notified, and inquiries are made by the Woman Inspector and disinfection carried out when requested. 58 ST. PANCRAS BOROUGH COUNCIL. Public Health Department. Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption). ADVICE TO CONSUMPTIVES. Description of Consumption. Consumption is not an inherited disease, but susceptibility' to take it may be sometimes inherited, sometimes induced by wrong habits or unhealthy conditions ; susceptibility is induced by insufficient or ill-assorted food, by strong drink, by scanty clothing, by sexual excesses, by any debilitating habits or illnesses, or by such unhealthy conditions as overcrowding, want of ventilation, closeness, darkness, dirtiness, and dampness in dwellings. It is not an incurable disease; if treated sufficiently early and thoroughly it is frequently cured, and in some pronounced cases the disease may be arrested, but at any stage of the disease, from early to far advanced, a consumptive, if not careful, may not only infect others, especially members of his own family, but may also re-infect himself. Consumption is a wasting disease caused by germs, which grow and multiply in the lungs. The germs give rise to coughing and spitting. In coughing, some of the germs are sometimes shot into the air in the spray of the cough, and in spitting they are always discharged from the lungs in large numbers in the spit or phlegm. Consumption is spread by the germs in the phlegm or spit and also in the cough-spray. They are occasionally coughed in spray directly into the mouth, nose, or eyes of another person, or are passed from mouth to mouth in kissing on the lips, or in drinking from the same vessel, or eating with the same table articles, but most frequently they are spread by being spat out in the phlegm or spit upon the surface of a covered or enclosed place where they dry up into dust which is wafted about and breathed into the lungs. This infected dust is most dangerous, and the most important point in the prevention of consumption is that the phlegm spat out by a consumptive should never be allowed to dry and should be burnt or boiled as soon as possible. Consumption germs are destroyed by sunlight, dayl ght, and fresh air; by the most scrupulous cleanliness in every detail of living; and by burning or boiling or washing away the phlegm and spit discharged from the nose and mouth of a consumptive. Consumption is cured, arrested or improved by living and sleeping in the open air, that is, by plenty of sunlight and fresh air, which is food for the lungs; by feeding well, that is, by plenty of wholesome, nourishing food for the body (especially fatty food) ; by clothing warmly, that is, so as to enable living and sleeping comfortably in the open air to be carried on; and by graduated outdoor work so as to restore the bodily vigour, which is the most effective means of resisting consumption. 59 Personal precautions to be taken by Consumptives. In coughing, do not cough into another person's face, and be careful when coughing to hold before your mouth a paper square, a piece of rag, or a handkerchief, which can be burnt, or boiled in the morning or evening, together with the satchel or pocket in which these articles are carried. Whether used to shield the cough or not, the hands should be washed before every meal. The phlegm or spit must not be swallowed, for two reasons : firstly, because it may set up the disease in the bowels, and secondly because, whether it sets up disease or not, it will infect the stools and render it necessary to take special precautions to disinfect them. In spitting, do not spit upon the floor, side wall, or other surface of the interior of any room, hall, conveyance, or other enclosed or covered place; but, when indoors, spit into a bowl, and when out of doors, into a widemouthed bottle or pocket spittoon, or into a street gulley. The bowl or bottle must contain some liquid to prevent the spit drying, and be properly covered or corked. The paper, rag, or handkerchief, and the satchel or pocket mentioned above to be used in coughing, may also be used for wiping the mouth, and—if the bowl or bottle is not at hand at the moment—also for receiving the phlegm, provided that it is not allowed to get dry and that as soon as possible it is burnt or boiled. The contents of the bowl or bottle should twice daily either be cast into a bright fire or down a water closet or be buried in the earth. The bowl with the cover off, or the bottle with the cork out should then be boiled in water for five or ten minutes and thoroughly cleansed, and the cover or cork should be similarly treated at the same time. In kissing, a consumptive should not kiss or be kissed on the lips, and it is safer for all persons, whether consumptive or not, to kiss and be kissed on the cheek. In eating, table articles, such as knives, forks, spoons, drinking vessels, and table napkins, after use by a consumptive, should be carefully washed in boiling water, and it is safest to reserve a set of such articles for his special use. All persons before handling food should wash their hands. In washing, a consumptive should have a separate towel for his special use in the same manner as he should have a separate table napkin and a separate handkerchief. In working, a consumptive should graduate his bodily work according to his condition, and carry it on either in the open air or in a room fully open to the air. In sleeping, a consumptive should not sleep with another person, but should occupy a separate bed, and best of all, should have a separate bedroom where open-air treatment can be carried on—the windows beiDg open day and night—with advantage to himself and his family. 6O General Precautions. Sunshine and daylight, fresh air and cleanliness, are the natural cnemesi of consumption. All living-rooms, sleeping-rooms, and work-rooms should be well lighted and well ventilated, and all chimney flues and fireplaces should be kept open. Frequently cleanse all Tooms, passages, and staircases. In cleansing, avoid raising dust, as it is dangerous, therefore adopt wet cleansing. In cleansing furniture, woodwork, etc., use damp dusters to wipe up the dust with, burn the dust, and boil the dusters after use. In cleansing carpets, hangings, etc., use damp tea-leaves or damp sawdust, and tie a damp duster over the broom ; burn the tea-leaves or sawdust, and boil the duster. In cleansing floors, scrub them with soft soap and boiling water. Meat, before being eaten, should be well cooked, and milk be boiled for five minutes. A room ceased to be occupied by a consumptive should not be used again until both the room and the contents have been thoroughly disinfected and cleansed. Disinfection is best carried out by the Borough Council. JOHN F. J. SYKES, Oclobcy, 1909. Medical Officer of Health. PULMONARY PHTHISIS (CONSUMPTION). SOCIETIES AND INSTITUTIONS FOR SEGREGATION Consumption is mainly spread by the germs in the spray of the cough and the phlegm of the spit. The more the disease advances and the more the weakness of the patient increases the greater the difficulty of preventing the cough-spray and spit-phlegm from disseminating the disease. Hence the most advanced cases are the most likely to spread the disease, and the poorest advanced cases the least likely to be able to provide against the spread of the disease. I.—Philanthropic Societies for providing separate bed-room accommodation for poor Consumptives at home do not exist in England as in France, where the benevolent branches of the Dispensaries for the Tuberculous make such provision, but application may perhaps be made to Religious and Medical Missions, District Visiting Committees, branches of the Charity Organisation Society, &c. II.—Homes for the last stage of Disease (including Consumption). Friedenheim Hospital, Sunnyside, Upper Avenue Road, Swiss Cottage, N.W. St. Luke's House, 14, Pembi'idge Square, Bayswater, W. The Hostel of God, 29, North Side, Clapham Common, S.W. St. Peter's Home (Women only), Mortimer Road, Ivilburn, NAY. 61 III.—Homes for Advanced Consumptives. For the destitute, the Poor Law Guardians of St. Pancras have provided Wards for Consumptives at the Northern Infirmary, Dartmouth Park Hill, N.W. For the necessitous, the Metropolitan Asylums Board have had under consideration on several occasions the question of providing accommodation for Consumptives, and the matter is still under consideration. For the provident, the National Committee for the establishment of Sanatoria for workers suffering from Tuberculosis (54, Gray's Inn Road, W.C., Secretary, W. G. liunn), proposes to construct sanatoria to be maintained by the combined efforts of Trade Unions and other labour organisations. For the impecunious who are able to secure the interest of subscribers or guarantors, and also for paying patients, the following institutions are available: — Home for Consumptive Females, 57 & 58, Gloucester Place, Portman Square, W. 26 beds. Admission £1 Is. entrance fee, and 7s. a week for chronic cases, and 10s. a week (without entrance fee) for cases awaiting admission to a Consumptive hospital. Hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth, 40, Grove End Road, St. John's Wood, N.W. 85 beds. Admission by Subscriber's letter. Women arc only admitted at present. A special ward for Consumption. St. Joseph's Hospital for Tncurable Women and Children, Burlington Lane, Chiswick, W. 40 beds. Admission 10s. 6d. weekly for women, and 5s. 6d. weekly for children. £2 2s. to £4 4s. weekly for a separate room. At Ventnor, St. Catherine's Home for Advanced Consumptives. At Bournemouth, Fir's Home for Advanced Consumptives. At Torquay, Mildmay Home for Advanced Consumptives. IV.—Special Hospitals for Pronounced Consumptives. All the special institutions mentioned below admit pronounced cases by letter of recommendation. The period of treatment of pronounced cases is limited, but patients are instructed and trained to so manage themselves as to avoid danger to others when they leave the institution. Mount Vernon Hospital for Consumption, Mount Vernon, Hampstead, N.W., and Northwood, Middlesex. 110 beds. Office and outpatients, 7, Fitzroy Square, W. Brompton Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, Brompton, S.W. 321 beds. Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, City Road, E.C. 80 beds. 'City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, Victoria Park, E. 164 beds. Hospital for Consumption, 26, Margaret Street, W., and Convalescent Home, Fail-light Hall, Hastings. [General hospitals are more and more inclined not to admit patients suffering from Consumption on account of the length of time they may require to occupy the hospital beds.] 62 V.—Sanatoriums for Incipient Consumptives. The National Association for the Prevention of Consumption and other forms of Tuberculosis publish a list of Sanatoria at their Central Office, 20, Hanover Square, W. (6d.). More or less complete lists to date are also published in the Medical Directory and other medical publications. The Sanatoria are too numerous to print here; they attract cases in the earliest stage before the expectoration of infective sputum has commenced or is fully established, and their object is to cure. VI.—Open-air Occupation for Consumptives. There is at present no special society for finding or providing open-air employment for Consumptives on leaving Sanatoriums, Hospitals, or Homes, or to work in conjunction with a society for providing separate bed-rooms at home for poor Consumptives. VII.—Precautions by Susceptible Persons. Members of families in which there is Consumption should have medical attention on the slightest deterioration of health, or if getting thinner, and should have as much fresh air and good food as possible. Children of such families may often be helped to obtain residence in the country by application to the Children's Country Holiday Fund, 18, Buckingham Street, Strand, W.C., or the Children's Sanatorium, or the Women's Holiday Fund, or the Invalid Children's Aid Association, Denison House, Vauxhall Bridge Road, S.W. Young persons who belong to Girls' or Boys' Clubs may be able to obtain information as to the Country Holidays from these organisations. Application may also be made to local branches of the Charity Organisation Society for information, and in suitable cases for help, as to convalescent and preventive treatment. CAMPAIGN AGAINST CONSUMPTION. During the year, under the auspices of the Mission of Magdalen College, Oxford, whose Settlement is established at No. 1, Oakley Square, N.W., a Public Welfare Association has been formed in St. Pancras. This Association consists of representatives of nearly all the philanthropic bodies in St. Pancras. The Association has started a " Campaign against Consumption" with the intention of co-operating with the St. Pancras Dispensary, 126, Euston lload, N.W., and the Municipal Authorities, in discovering and assisting poor consumptives, in such a manner as to prevent the spread of the disease, to alleviate the condition of advanced cases, to procure the amelioration and cure of the more hopeful sufferers, and, lastly, but most important of all, to avert the danger of other members of a family becoming susceptible or being infected. The following is the scheme for examination of sufferers and suspects:— 1. The Public Health Department and the Public Welfare Association, through their Visitors, search out and receive information of persons suffering, or suspected to be suffering, from pulmonary tuberculosis, and send those who have no medical attendants to the St. Pancras Dispensary with Introduction Cards for medical examination as to consumption. 2. The St. Pancras Dispensary examines medically for the presence of consumption the suspects sent to the Institution with Introduction 63 Cards from the Visitors, the Medical Examiners availing themselves, when necessary far diagnosis, of the specimen boxes provided by the Borough Council for the bacteriological examination of sputum, and notifying confirmed and probable cases of pulmonary phthisis to the Medical Officer of Health, who passes them on to the Woman Inspector for confidential inquiry. 3. The Public Health Department, upon the receipt of the Medical Notification, sends to each case an Advice Card for the consumptive's use, and an offer to disinfect the bedroom upon removal of the patient from one room to another or one house to another, together with a list of Public Institutions receiving consumptives at different stages of the disease ; and in each case makes enquiry into the hvgenic and social circumstances of the patient in relation to the disease, and sends a copy of the inquiry to the Medical Attendant notifying and to the Hon. Secretary of the Public Welfare Association. (N.B.—The Public Health Department carefully refrains from making any inquiry at the place of occupation of a patieDt and from any other measures likely to prejudice a patient.) 4. The Public Welfare Association receives, through their Hon. Sec. from the Woman Inspector, a copy of the confidential inquiry (where instruction, guidance and assistance are necessary) for the purpose of the Visitor of the Association, in order that she may arrange that medical advice and treatment appropriate to the social and pecuniary circumstances of the case are provided, and that the patient may be regularly and periodically visited at the home to see that any medical instructions are properly carried out and that the patient has such necessaries as are required to re-establish or maintain health. On the initiation of the Public Welfare Association, supported by the St. Pancras Dispensary and the Municipal Authorities, a Tuberculosis Prevention Exhibition was held at the Working Men's College, Crowndale Road, from April 14th to 23rd, 1910. This Exhibition, organised by the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption, was supplemented by exhibits of local interest, and proved a most effective method of demonstrating the possibilities of the prevention and cure of consumption in this Borough. Popular lectures were given by leading experts in the subject, and, during its stay in St. Pancras, it is estimated that several thousands visited the Exhibition. The following were the exhibits shown and lectures delivered:— Division t.— The Disease. Sub-Division I.—Pathology. (What Consumption is and its Effects.) ,, II.—Statistics and Statistical Inquiries.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sik, I submit a report on the work done in connection with notified cases of consumption during the year 1909. The year has been the first in which cases of consumption treated by the Medical Officers of the Guardians has been eompulsorily notifiable. '1 his work is an extension of that previously don# in this Borough on the basis of voluntary notification. In a previous report, attention has been drawn to the value of such notification in bringing to the knowledge of this authority those cases and families which most require advice as to general precaution, and which may usefully be placed in connection with various helpful agencies. The year has also been marked by the development of the long-desired scheme for dealing with the various aspects of the disease through the charitable and social associations of the district. The formation last autumn of the Public Welfare Association brought into relation with each other and with this department the philanthropic workers of the Borough. Much valuable work has been done, and there is every prospect of still more valuable results from the efforts of this Association, to which, and more particularly to whose Honorary Secretaries, much gratitude is due. We are also much indebted to the Saint Pancras Dispensary for providing Medical examination for those suspected cases not already in the hands of their own doctor. We now require the notification of those cases with whose homes 110 medical practitioner is in immediate contact If the regulations applying to the Poor Law Medical Officers applied also to the hospitals and dispensaries, we should then be in touch with all the cases most urgently in need of such help as we can give; and if care is taken that the wishes of the medical attendant are regarded and that the patient is not alarmed or harassed, we shall no doubt obtain by voluntary notification those other cases to whom we can be of use. To illustrate the inter-connection of Poor Law and Hospital cases it mav be noted that of the Poor Law cases notified during the vear sixty were known to have previously received attention at Hospitals, and of the voluntary notified cases five were known to have been previously in the care of the Guardians. For practical purposes, however, the pressing problem is not so much the -discovery of new cases as the discovery of adequate means of dealing with those already found. While every voluntary institution has a long waiting list; while many of our people reject the help of the Guardians from hatred of the pauper label; while there is 110 adequate fund for the provision of home treatment either as a substitute for, or as a continuation of, sanatorium treatment; while the provision for advanced and dying cases still requires wide extension ; it is idle to remain satisfied with the distribution of printed and spoken advice, -essential though this is. 69 Occupation for the patients is also a pressing difficulty, and unemployment is often the end as well as the beginning of the disease. Some valuable work in relation to consumption has been done by the School for mothers. Miss Colles as Superintendent has taken great interest in mothers in danger of developing the disease, and Miss Potty's work as Assistant Superintendant, in teaching in the homes of the people the making of nourishing and inexpensive dishes, goes near to the root of this and many other health difficulties. This year's work has confirmed the experience of previous years, but has given few new points of interest. Two cases occurring in cleaners and attendants at places of amusement may be noted. Both complained of the effects of dust inhaled during work, and it seems probable that this was an active cause of their illness. Improved methodsof cleansing, both domestic and general, seem much needed. Almost every form of cleansing involves the inhaling of dust or the contamination of the hands. The domestic doormat is probably a potent spreader of infection, and the ordinary broom, in street or house, does the same work. Some cheap and destructible form of sputum flask is desirable. The ordinary glass bottle approved for cleanly and careful patients is less suitable for the careless and unintelligent, whose lack of fastidiousness must he noted in their unguarded moments to be fully understood. The compressed paper box distributed by the Manchester Health Department seems preferable to the glass bottle, as being destructible together with is contents. Two cases of consumption in caretakers in unoccupied premises were found. In both cases the rooms occupied were disinfected after the patients' removal. The regulations relating to Poor Law Notifications prohibit any action which directly or indirectly subjects the person notified to any disability affecting his employment, occupation, means of livelihood or residence. The wisdom of this caution is evident, and every care has been taken in dealing with the cases to comply implicitly with its requirements. Any action consequent on notification which may tend to deter other sufferers from availing themselves of medical care will necessarily do harm, even though the action in the single case may seem to be desirable. Although 110 immediate and direct action may be taken with reference to the place of employment of a patient, information of much value relating to industrial conditions will be obtained, and, with proper proper caution, acted upon. A further valuable contribution to the improvement of industrial conditions will be the education of the patient and household as to the value of fresh air and general cleanliness. Too often, at present, the employees object to the full use of means of ventilation provided in workshops, anil persist in undesirable practices which can only be stopped by themselves. I am, Sir, Your ole lient Servant, M. E. Bibby, Sanitary Inspector. 70 Addendum.

(Legislation) of the Annual Report for 1907 the London Order of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, dated 12th September, 1907, as to the Notification of Glanders in Horses was quoted, and also the Regulations of the London County Council thereunder. In Part III. (Infectious Diseases) of the same Annual Report paragraphs relating to human glanders were quoted, and it was explained that in future, by the Order, a Veterinary Inspector must report the existence of glanders to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough as well as to the County Council. During the year 1909 the Veterinary Inspector reported 16 outbreaks of glanders in horses in various stables in the Borough. § 3.—ISOLATION AND EXCLUSION.

EXCLUSION OF CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL ON ACCOUNT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, WHETHER NOTIFIABLE OR NON- NOTIFIABLE. On September 8th, 1909, the following instruction was issued to the Sanitary Inspectors :— Dr. Kerr, the Medical Officer of the Education Branch of London County Council, informed me on Monday, 6th instant, that he proposes to give the following instruction as a new rule in regard to the exclusion of children from school on account of contact with infectious disease:— Present Rule. Only children coming from the same flat, or, in a tenement house, from the same floor in the case of self-contained tenements, where infection exists should be excluded from attendance at school. Proposed Rule Where a case of infectious disease occurs in any premises inhabited by children attending a public elementary school the children should be excluded from school, in accordance with the following rules, where a portion or portions of such premises are sub-let:— (a) In the case of "Model Dwellings" or "Trust Buildings," etc., only children from the same flat (or self-contained tenement) as that in which the case of infection exists. (b) In the case of an ordinary dwelling house sub-let, children from the whole house should be excluded, except in cases where the tenements are absolutely self-contained and each family has its own domestic and sanitary conveniences, in which case the above mentioned rule (a) will apply. 72 COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND DISORDERS.

In December, 1909, I reported specially upon this subject. During 1908, in London, according to the Registrar-General's returns, there were 228 cases of puerperal fever notified and 137 deaths, which included puerperal septicaemia, pyaemia, sapraemia, and fever, that is to say, the puerperal septic diseases. During 1908, in St. Pancras, eight cases of puerperal fever were notified, four cases were removed to hospital, and two deaths occurred of this class of disease. Of the four cases removed to hospital, two were removed to the North Infirmary of St. Pancras, one to the University College Hospital, and one to the British Lying-in Hospital. The case removed to the University College Hospital appears to have been one attended through the extern maternity department of the hospital, and was therefore a hospital case from the beginning. The case admitted into the British Lying-in Hospital entered that Hospital to be confined, and possibly was a case of auto infection after a difficult confinement, at any rate a hospital case from the first. I have caused inquiry to be made of the General Hospitals in St. Pancras— University College Hospital, Royal Free Hospital, New Hospital for Women, Temperance Hospital—and I am informed that they do not admit lying-in women suffering from puerperal septic diseases. Doubtless one of the reasons for this is the danger of the disease being so easily carried from one patient to another in a maternity ward. The cases usually admitted to maternity wards of hospitals are those of diseases, injuries, or malformations of women about to be confined, and who require special attention, and possibly some form of manipulation or operation. The Poor Law Hospitals, that is the North and South Infirmaries in St. Pancras, are compelled to admit destitute persons suffering from disease, and cannot refuse to admit cases of such an urgent nature as puerperal sepsis suddenly brought to the door of the Infirmary and thrown upon the care of the Guardians. The Metropolitan Asylums Board do not admit cases of puerperal fever to their hospitals. The infections of scarlet fever, diphtheria, &c., have always been legarded as particularly dangerous to women lying-in, and it has been considered inadvisable to admit lying-in women to fever hospitals. From the point of view of the spread of infection, it is open to question whether it is the more desirable to remove a puerperal fever patient from her isolation at home into the ward of a hospital. This may free the home, medical practitioner, midwife, and nurse from the chance of conveying infection, but will transfer the chance to the hospital practitioner, midwife, and nurse. The latter will have more appliances and facilities at hand to minimise infection, but will also be subject to greater facilities for conveying infection. From the point of view of the treatment of the patient, in the homes of the poorer classes it cannot be expected that the same facilities, appliances, and attendance can be provided as are to be found in the ward of a hospital. But it can be expected that extreme cleanliness and the utmost precautions should be observed in the house, that pregnant women should be instructed to be well 77 prepared and observe these precautions, and that nurses, midwives and doctors should also supervise and exercise these precautions. An important bearing upon this is the fact that since the passing of the Midwives Act, 1902, there has been a remarkable permanent fall in the mortality from puerperal septic diseases, as shown in the Annual Reports of the Registrar-General. I have come to the conclusion that the question of the desirability of, or necessity for, providing hospital accommodation for puerperal septic diseases is one that can only be satisfactorily thrashed out in an inquiry by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, where the evidence of medical experts, midwives and nurses of all shades of opinion would be heard. Your Borough Council resolved, on the 15th December, 1909, that the Metropolitan Asylums Board be asked to make an inquiry into the desirability of, and the necessity for, providing hospital accommodation for puerperal septie diseases upon the evidence of medical experts, midwives, and nurses, and to publish a report upon the subject for the guidance of the public, the profession, and the Metropolitan Borough Councils. In January, 1910, the Guardians of St. Pancras concurred with the proposals of the Borough Council and took similar action. A reply was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board stating that whilst the Managers are in sympathy with the Council they are of opinion that such an inquiry could best be made by the Local Government Board, inasmuch as the Managers have no machinery for instituting or conducting such an inquiry, nor have they the power to incur expenditure for the creation of the necessary machinery. They state, however, that in the event of the Local Government Board deciding to add puerperal fever to the list of infectious diseases for which the Asylums Board are required to provide accommodation, they would be prepared to make arrangements for the reception of certified cases of this disease into the hospitals under their control. The Medical Officer of Health drew further attention to the fact that in London, in 1908, as the number of deaths from puerperal fever was 137 and the number of cases was 228, the case mortality was 60 per cent.—a very high proportion. It is possible that prompt expert treatment in hospital would reduce both the case mortality and the prevalence of the disease, and the amount of hospital accommodation required to effect this would be small. Assuming that of the 228 cases as large a proportion as one-half required to be promptly removed to the hospital, then 114 cases would have to be provided for during the year. This represents 2.2 cases per week—say 3—and if they remain in the hospital an average of three weeks, there would be nine cases in hospital at the same time, so that by the provision of about a dozen beds with the necessary staff and appliances the requirements would be satisfied. Your Borough Council resolved, on 23rd February, 1910, that the Local Government Board be asked to make an inquiry into the desirability of, and and the necessity for, providing hospital accommodation for puerperal septic diseases, and to publish a report upon the subject for the guidance of the public, the profession, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the Metropolitan Borough Councils. 78 §4.—DISINFECTION AND CLEANSING.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CLEANSING STATION. (I.) In 1893 a Family Shelter (now known as a Contact Shelter) was erected at the Disinfecting Station over the coach-houses, wash-house, and store room in the western wing of the station buildings at a cost of £450. This Contact Shelter consisted of four rooms, each with a bath room attached and two W.C.'s, one at each end of the corridor of access, and was approached from the station yard by an outside iron staircase at the south end. (See M.O. H.'s Annual Report for 1892.) (II.) In 1903 the room at the rear of the wash-house on the ground floor and at the north end of the western wing of the buildings was converted into two bath rooms for verminous men at a cost of £45. Similarly the north end room with bath room of the Contact Shelter over was fitted with a second bath, and provided with a separate iron staircase for access from the station yard and so converted into two bath rooms for verminous women and children at a cost of £42. This part of the building used for verminous persons was cut. off from the Contact Shelter and named the Personal Cleansing House, and cost altogether £87. (see Annual Reports of M.O.H. for 1903-4.) 81 (III.) In 1904-5-6 it had been found that more accommodation was necessary for children, that the children required to be separated from the adults, that a more desirable point of access should be provided for the children, and that it was advisable to avoid the repellance of the terms "cleansing of verminous persons" in connection with children accidentally acquiring vermin by attending school. Accordingly, at the beginning of 1906, the two middle rooms (each with bath room attached) of the four rooms on the upper floor of the west wing were set apart for children and cut off from the Contact Shelter at the south end of the women's portion of the Personal Cleansing House at the north end by the provision of glass doors, locked by the Woman Attendant. This part of the building was named the Children's Baths, and access was provided to it by means of a new entrance made on the west side of the building by shifting one of the baths and erecting a substantial iron staircase approached from the St. Pancras Gardens. These alterations cost £50. (See Annual Report of M.O.H. for 1906.) In 1908 it was found necessary to provide two new baths, one in the girls' and one in the boys' room, at a cost of £14 10s.; so that the Children's Baths consist of four— two for the boys and two for the girls. The new entrance and staircase and two additional baths cost together £64 10s. In consequence of a large amount of clothing requiring to be disinfected at frequent intervals during the day, and the excessive wear and tear in using the large steam chambers for this work, a new small disinfecting apparatus was installed to relieve the larger chambers. At the same time a vertical boiler was erected to produce all the steam and hot water for the several buildings in substitution of fires and a geyser. THE CLEANSING OF VERMINOUS SCHOOL CHILDREN. The Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, empowers local authorities to expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants, and empowers them to permit any persons infested with vermin to have the use, free of charge, of such, for the purpose of cleansing their persons and clothing of vermin. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, section 19, empowers the sanitary authorities, upon the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health that any articles are filthy, dangerous or unwholsome, to cleanse, purify or destroy such articles; section 20 similarly empowers the sanitary authorities to require owners of houses to strip, cleanse, etc., rooms or parts of houses upon the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health that any house, or part, is infested with vermin; section 21 applies section 59 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, compelling sanitary authorities to provide means for cleansing, purifying and destroying filthy, dangerous or unwholesome articles and for the removal thereof, and for the cleansing of houses infested with vermin to the purposes of the two preceding sections of the Act, and section 24 gives the sanitary authorities power of entry for the purpose of carrying out the afore-mentioned sections, and in the interpretation, section 23, it is to be observed, that the expression " house " includes " schools." The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, by section 36, empowers the Medical Officer of the London County Council to examine the 82 person and clothing of any child attending a school, and if the child be found to be verminous, to require that the parent or other person should properly cleanse such child and the clothing within 24 hours, and if the person fail, may then remove the child from any school and cause the person and clothing of such child to be properly cleansed; by section 37, similar provision is made enabling the Medical Officer of the London County Council to enforce the cleansing of the person and clothing of the inmates of common lodginghouses ; section 38 enables the County Council and any sanitary authorities to make and carry into effect agreements and arrangements for the purpose of cleansing of the person and clothing in the afore-mentioned cases, and section 40 empowers the London County Council to make regulations with respect to the mode of carrying into effect the provisions of the above sections. Following upon these provisions, the Minutes of the London County Council of the 4th February, 1908, p. 157, contain instructions that (a) the provisions of the Act of 1907, with respect to verminous inmates of common lodging-houses, should be carried out by the Public Health Committee, and that they should have power to enter into agreements or arrangements ; and b) that the provisions with respect to verminous children attending schools should be exercised bv the Education Committee, and that regulations affecting such children should be made by such Committee; but (c) that arrangements with sanitary authorities should be made through one Committee, namely, the Public Health Committee. The Children Act, 1908, by section 122, sub-sections (1) and (2), reproduces the powers of section 36, sub-sections (1) and (2), of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with regard to the examination of children attending school, giving notice and requisitions to cleanse the person and clothing of any child infested with vermin or in a foul or filthy condition, and for the removal and forcible detention and cleansing of such child. And, in addition to this, sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 122 of the Children Act, 1908, provide :— " (3) Where any sanitary authority within the district of a local " education authority have provided, or are entitled to the use of any " premises or appliances for cleansing the person or clothing of persons " infested with vermin, the sanitary authority shall, if so required by the " local education authority, allow the local education authority to use " such premises and appliances for the purpose of this section upon such " payment (if any) as may be agreed between them, or, in default of an " agreement, settled by the Local Government Board. " (4) Where after the person or clothing of a child has been cleansed " by the local education authority under this section the parent or " guardian of, or other person liable to maintain the child, allows him to " get into such a condition that it is again necessary to proceed under this " section, the parent, guardian, or other person shall, on summary con" viction, be liable to a fine not exceeding 10s." In July, 1909, a letter to the following effect was addressed from the Education Offices of the London County Council, Victoria Embankment, W.C., to the Town Clerks of certain Metropolitan Borough Councils : — " Sir, Cleansing of Children Infested with Vennin. " The appropriate Committee of the Council have again had under " consideration the question of the cleansing of school children infested 83 "with vermin. The Committee are anxious that a definite understanding"should be arrived at between the local Sanitary Authority and the "Council in regard to the arrangements for the attendance of the children " at the cleansing stations. "It is not possible to estimate at the present time the number of "children which would require treatment, but the Committee are anxious "to know what accommodation is available for the purpose, and they "would like to be informed as to the number of children which could be "cleansed per day at the station provided by your Council. "With regard to the cost of cleansing children, section 122 (3) of " the Children Act, 1908, provides that the Sanitary Authority shall, if " so required by the local Education Authority, allow the local Education "Authority to use the premises provided by the Sanitary Authority upon " such payment (if any) as may be agreed between them. " In this connection I shall be glad if you will kindly inform me " what amount per head of children cleansed the St. Pancras Metropolitan " liorough Council would be willing to accept from the Council in the " event of the Council deciding to take advantage of the provision of the " Children Act above referred to. " I am, Sir, " Your obedient Servant, " (Signed) R. Bi.air." Education Officer_ From information received some time ago, it appeared that 9 of the London Boroughs had made no provision for the cleansing of verminous persons ; that 16 had made considerable provision, and 4 had made tentative provision to carry out the Act. It is recognised that the advent of school children to a cleansing station enables the bedfellows also to be persuaded to come; and, furthermore, enables the sanitary authority to cleanse the clothing and bedding, and also other members of the family, as well as the dwelling itself. Without the advent of children of school age, the possibility of obtaining the cleansing of the person and clothing of persons of other ages at home, and the clothing and bedding of the dwelling, would largely cease. If verminous school children are cleansed by the education authority, they cannot follow up the case into the home, and merely giving notice to the sanitary authority of such cleansing would still deprive the sanitary authority of the lever afforded by the personal attendance of verminous school children who bring their bedfellows along with them, and lead to a further sequence of events. Furthermore, the action of the education authority in cleansing would cease during 9 or 10 weeks of holiday throughout the year. It would seem somewhat anomalous that the sanitary authority should have the power and duty of cleansing persons of both sexes and all ages except children of schooI-age. It would be difficult to understand the object of the exception, as such children are as much part of the community under the care of the sanitary authorities of the Metropolitan Boroughs as persons under or over school-age. 84 It may he observed that baths for the object of cleansing verminous persons, adults and children, are in a different category to ordinary cleansing or hot baths. Again, to a different category belong swimming baths intended for exercise, and morning baths mainly intended as an invigorating tonic and discipline. The Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, empowers the Borough Council to expand money in providing a cleansing station. The General Powers Act, 1904, enables the Borough Council to deal with the houses. The General Powers Act, 1907, confers compulsory powers on the County Council for the removal of verminous school children and verminous inmates of common lodging-houses to cleansing stations. The Children Act, 1908, enlarges the powers with regard to school children, and compels the Borough Council to permit the use of their cleansing station by the local education authority for the cleansing of school children upon an agreed payment. Several communications have been received from the London County Council (Education Department) with regard to the possibility of the Borough Council arranging definitely to bath verminous children at a fixed charge per head, ill accordance with the provisions of section 122, sub-section (-3), of the Children Act, 1908, above mentioned. Ultimately, on the 4th May, 1910, a communication was received from the London County Council (Education Department), stating that they had provisionally agreed upon the general outline of the following scheme for the treatment of children throughout London :— 1. That the cleansing stations provided by the various Metropolitan Borough Councils should, as far as possible, be utilised by agreement with the Borough Councils. 2. That the treatment of children should be entirely distinct from any establishment used for the isolation of suspected cases of infectious disease contacts. 3. That the exclusive use of the baths for the cleansing of children should be allowed on certain days. 4. That the cleansing station should be in a convenient position, and that the children should be efficiently supervised, with female attendants for the treatment of the girls. 5. That a uniform payment to the Borough Council at the rate of 2s. per child, irrespective of the number of baths required before a child can be regarded as cleansed, should be arranged throughout London. 6. That this scheme be subject to the Borough Councils undertaking, where necessary, to deal with the homes of the children cleansed. Your Borough Council approved on the 1st June, 1910, that the London County Council be informed that this Authority are in agreement with the above outlined scheme provided that the payment of 2s. per child shall not cover a period of time exceeding two weeks, and that this limitation be added to paragraph 5 thereof; and that in reference to paragraph 6, it is already the practice of this Council to deal, where necessary, with the homes of the children cleansed. 83 CLEANSING INMATES OF COMMON LODGING-HOUSES. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, by section 37, provision is made enabling tbe Medical Officer of the London County Council to enforce the cleansing of the person and clothing of the inmates of common lodging- houses; section 38 enables the London County Council and any sanitary authorities to make and carry into effect agreements and arrangements for the purpose of cleansing the persons and clothing in the afore-mentioned cases, and section 40 empowers the London County Council to make regulations with respect to the mode of carrying into effect the provisions of the above sections. The County Council inquired whether the St. Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council would be prepared to cleanse any persons from common lodging-houses in the Borough if sent by the County Council; and whether, in the event of the Council of a neighbouring Metropolitan Borough not having made proper provision, the St. Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council would be prepared to enter into an arrangement for the cleansing of inmates from common lodginghouses in that neighbouring borough if sent by the County Council. It was considered that such facilities should be given, and the County Council were informed that this authority would be prepared to cleanse any persons sent from common lodging-houses in the borough, and, so far as is found to be possible, those who may be sent from neighbouring boroughs, at a charge of 6d. per person for attendance. The final acceptance of this offer has not yet been received. 86 § 5.—VACCINATION.—The following are the Returns kindly supplied by the Clerk to the Guardians: — Return respecting the Vaccination of Children whose Births were registered in the Parish of Saint Pancras, from 1st January to 31st December, 1908, inclusive.

In the Annual Report for 1907 an account was given of the changes which have taken place in the Inspectorial Staff from 1898 to 1907. In the Annual Report for 1908 an account was given of the resolution of the Borough Council of the 31st July, 1907, to dismiss a District Inspector, and the resolution of the Borough Council of the 18th September, 1908, not to appoint a Sanitary Inspector to fill the vacancy created, and of the correspondence and inquiry of the Local Government Board upon the subject. In continuation of the account already given, the following letter was received from the Local Government Board, dated 5th August, 1909 : — " Sir,— "I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th ultimo, relative to the arrangements for the discharge of the duties of Sanitary Inspector in the Borough of St. Pancras. "The Board direct me to draw attention to their letter of the 8th December last, in which they stated that it appeared to them that ' the large area of 'Highgate Sub-division and the special character of the New Town area ' therein demand the services of one Inspector.' The Board still adhere to 95 this view, which is founded on the report made to them by their Inspector, I)r. Sweeting, after his inquiry into the sufficiency of the staff of Sanitary Inspectors in the Borough. "In the Board's opinion, the proposal of the Borough Council to readjust the Food Inspectors districts, and to allocate the Grospel Oak Sub-division to one of the Food Inspectors for sanitary purposes, will not sufficiently relieve the pressure of work in the North Division, where regular house-to-house inspection and more extended registration of tenement houses are especially needed. "The Board must, therefore, urge the Borough Council to reconsider the matter with a view to appointing an additional Sanitary Inspector. "The Board request that, at as early a date as possible, they may be informed of the result of the Borough Council's further consideration of the question. "I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) John Lithiby, Assistant Secretary." "The Town Clerk, St. Pancras." After the vacation and further consideration of the subject, on the 6th October, 1909, Mr. B. II. Thompson was appointed Sanitary Inspector, and on 27th October your Council agreed to the work of Sanitary Inspection in the North Division being: divided and distributed as follows :— Sub-Division 1 (Highgate) „ 2 (St. John's Park) „ 3 (Gospel Oak) „ 4 (Grafton) ,, 5 (Maitland Park) . . Inspector Rackham. j ,, Brown. „ Thompson.

On the 23rd February, 1910, your Council accepted the resignation of Miss Blanche Gardiner, B.A., on her appointment as Superintendent of the Staff of Health Visitors of the City of Birmingham. During Miss Gardiner's term of office in St. Pancras, from October, 190.), to February, 1910, she instructed a large number of Voluntary Visitors, and utilised their services for the benefit of the Borough. After a number of months of service, varying from a minimum of three to a maximum of six, many of these ladies obtained official posts or responsible employment elsewhere, and this is a convenient opportunity for reviewing the work done in this direction. The work of Public Health Authorities divides itself mainly into two kinds, the one dealing with the condition of the environment (places), and the other with the health of individuals and families (persons). The former is mainly statutory, and the latter mainly adoptive. Few of the statutory powers fall into the province of women, but nearly all the adoptive powers come within their province. The statutory powers embrace: (a) the inspection of factories, workshops, and workplaces where women are employed; (b) the inspection of outworkers' premises, domestic workshops, and home workplaces ; and (c) the inspection of restaurant kitchens and eating bouses where women are employed. The adoptive powers embrace (1) the Notification of Births Act and the prevention of infant mortality; (2) the notification of pulmonary tuberculosis and the prevention of consumption, and of susceptibility thereto; (3) the notification from schools of verminous children, and the cleansing of the children, their bedfellows, clothing, and bedding ; and (4) the notification from schools of the non-certifiable infectious diseases, e.g., measles. 98 The women who carry on this work are classifiable according to official • » • status and qualification— 1. Women Sanitary Inspectors. II. Women Health Visitors. (A) Official Health Visitors (paid). (B) Unofficial Health Visitors (unpaid). (i.) Professional Voluntary Visitors, (ii.) Philanthropic Voluntary Visitors. The Professional Voluntary Visitors are women professionally qualified as Sanitary Inspectors, Midwives, or nurses, or holding certificates in hygiene, nursing, etc., and intending to take up the calling professionally, and who give their services for three or four months or more in return for the practical experience gained, and a testimonial as to the manner in which they carried out their duties. The Philanthropic Voluntary Visitors are women in independent circumstances who desire to employ part of their time in beneficial public work, and to obtain an insight into public life and official work on the woman's side. Some few philanthropic women have attended intermittently or for short periods, but the professional women are those whose attendance has been regular, constant, and assiduous, and the latter class it will be of interest to enumerate those who have obtained official or responsible posts. About 40 ladies altogether have taken up work seriously and gone through with it, and obtained appointments of some kind— Mrs. Barnes—Superintendent St. Pancras School for Mothers. Superintendent Duxhurst Home for Inebriates. Miss Kanthak (now Madam Emilia de Voss)—Lecturer and authoress of several books on Infancy and Childhood in English and German.

Smoke. — In the Annual Report for 1902 the enactments dealing with smoke were set out in full. There are 334 smoke shafts on the Register ; 689 observations of these were taken, and 164 re-inspections were made after notices served. These observations or inspections and re-inspections occupy a considerable amount of time, as the intervals between stoking are of considerable duration—at least twenty minutes, and often twice as long. The Inspectors are now instructed to limit their observation of a chimney to half an hour, and only to prolong it beyond this period so long as a nuisance is actually being committed. (See Minutes of Public Health Committee of 30th January, 1907.) Effluvia.—of various businesses and places producing effluvia or offensive emanations there are 136 on the Registers, and of these 288 inspections and 15 re-inspections were made. (See also under the head of Nuisances § 9.) § 3.-DWELLINGS. (a) House-to-House Inquiries and Inspections.—(i.) For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of sub-letting 188 inquiries and 61 re-visits were made as to the occupation of houses in tenemented streets, (ii.) When the mode of sub-letting appears to be such as to necessitate periodical supervision of the sanitary condition of a house, a complete inquiry is made into the mode of occupation of each room of the house. (iii.) When it has been decided to register a tenement house, each room is measured as to its dimensions and capacity and recorded in the Register. The forms in which the reports as to these matters arc made were quoted in the Annual Report for 1904. (b) Tenement Houses.—During the year 47 inspections and 61 re-inspections were made for the purpose of measuring tenement or lodging houses which it had been decided to register, and at the end of the year 2280 houses were upon the Register. Of these houses 2398 periodical half-yearly inspections were made, and 5565 re-inspections after the service of notices; also of the 339 dwellings entered in the Register of Inscribed Dwellings 250 inspections were made, and 354 re-inspections after the service of notices. The following is a record relating to registered tenement houses:— On Register at end of 1908 2271 Registered during 1909 12 Total 2283 Ceased to be registered houses in 1909 3 On Register at end of 1909 2280 103 By-laws as to houses let in lodgings or to members of more than one family. The amendment of these By-laws is still under consideration. ACCOMMODATION IN TENEMENT HOUSES. The last three General Powers Acts of the London County Council have regulated the accommodation in Tenement Houses for (a) the supply of water, (b) the cooking of food, and (c) the storage of food. MEANING OF "TENEMENT HOUSE." "Tenement House" means any house occupied by any person of the working class which is wholly or partially let in lodgings, or which is occupied by members of more than one family; and "working class" has the same meaning as in the Schedule to the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903 (L.C.C. G.P.A., 1907, Part xii. (2), Section 3.—Interpretation of Terms.) The expression "working class" includes mechanics, artisans, labourers, and others working for wages; hawkers, costermongers, persons not working for wages, but working at some trade or handicraft without employing others, except members of their own family, and persons other than domestic servants whose income in any case does not exceed an average of thirty shillings a week, and the families of any such persons who may be residing with them. (Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1903, Schedule (12) (e).) (a) LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1907. Section 78.—As to Supply of Water in Tenement Houses. 78. —For the purposes of section 48 (Provisions as to House without Proper Water Supply) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a tenement house shall be deemed to be a house without a proper and efficient supply of water unless there shall be provided on the storey or one of the storeys in which the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of each family occupying such house are situate a sufficient provision for the supply of water for domestic purposes: Provided that with respect to any building existing and in use as a tenement house at the passing of this Act this section shall not (A) come into operation until the first day of January One thousand nine hundred and eight; or (b) apply where the only storey or storeys on which a proper and sufficient supply of water is not provided is or are a storey or storeys (1) constructed at a height exceeding that to which the Metropolitan Water Board may for the time being be required to furnish a supply of water for domestic purposes, and (2) to which a supply of water for such purposes is not at the passing of this Act being furnished by the said Board by agreement: Provided also that this section shall not apply to any tenement house in respect of which it can be shown that any such provision for the supply of water as aforesaid is not reasonably necessary. 104 (b) LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1908. Section 7. As to Accommodation for Cooking of Food in Tenement Houses. 7. If at any time it appears to any sanitary authority that in any tenement house within their district sufficient and suitable accommodation for the cooking of food is not provided for the use of each family occupying such house on the storey or one of the storeys in which are situate the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of such family, such sanitary authority may cause notice to be served on the owner of such house requiring him within such reasonable time as may be specified in the notice to provide sufficient and suitable accommodation for the purpose aforesaid, and any owner failing to comply with any such requirement within the period prescribed in the notice shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings, and to a daily penalty not exceeding twenty shillings : Provided that this Section shall not apply to any tenement house used or occupied as such before the passing of this Act. (c) LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1909. Section 16. As to accommodation for storage of Food. 16. If at any time it appears to any sanitary authority that in any tenement house within their district sufficient and suitable accommodation for the storage of food is not provided for the use of each family occupying such house on the storey or one of the storeys in which are situated the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of such family, the sanitary authority may, if the provision of such accommodation is practicable, cause notice to be served on the owner of such house requiring him within such reasonable time as may be specified in the notice to provide sufficient and suitable accommodation for the purpose aforesaid, and any owner failing to comply with such requirement within the period prescribed in the notice shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings and to a daily penalty not exceeding twenty shillings : Provided that this section shall not apply to any tenement house used or occupied as such before the passing of this Act. (a) In regard to water supply, it may be be said that the installation of a draw-off tap implies also the provision of a drip-sink to prevent or abate the nuisance that is certain to occur from the dripping of the tap and the consequent dampness, and perhaps flooding. The question therefore to be be decided is —which is the lesser of two two evils, (1) the absence of water supply to a flat or floor, or (2) the presence of a sink which will be used as a drip-sink, a scullery sink, and a slop sink. The waste-pipe of the sink must be properly trapped under the sink at the inlet end of the pipe, and at its outlet-end must discharge directly into an enclosed continuity with a main waste-pipe running externally on an outer wall of the house from a point above the parapet or roof downwards, open at both ends for ventilation, and the lower end discharging over the surface of the water of a properly trapped gulley situated in the open air. 105 A careful person using such a sink for all three purposes could prevent any effluvia or exhalations by flushing it after use, and from time to time cleansing it with a pailful of boiling water strongly impregnated with washing soda. But a careless person, or one who neglected the necessary flushing and cleansing, might create an intolerable nuisance in a house. The houses so fitted and occupied by such careless or negligent persons may require considerable additional inspection until the occupants become educated to the proper usage of such sinks. An inquiry was received from the London County Council asking whether the provision had proved beneficial, and your Borough Council, on 29th July, 1908, replied that no notices had been served under the section, and resolved that no action be taken in the matter. (b) With regard to accommodation for the cooking of food, this is a question of the kind of grate or stove which will permit of the cooking to be done for the family. If there be no grate or stove at all in the dwelling the position is clear, but to define what is "sufficient and suitable" accommodation for the cooking of food is 0[:en to wide and varying interpretations. (c) With regard to "sufficient and suitable accommodation" for the storage of food, the same difficulty arises as to interpretations and opinions. Some families supply their want by a network cage on a window sill, to obtain ventilation and exclude flies, vermin, and animals. Provision may extend from such a simple appliance to an elaborate structural erection, complying with the three requirements — (1) complete enclosure, (2) permanent ventilation from thy external air, and (3) exclusion of flies, vermin, and animals. Inscribed Dwellings. For the purpose of periodical inspection a List of Inscribed Dwellings is kept. This List includes— 1. Cottage* of one, two, three or more rooms occupied by one family and which cannot be registered, e.g., Equity Buildings. 2. Dire/lings orer Stables which require periodical inspection bat cannot be registered, e.g., Wakefield Mews. 3. Houses in certain areas represented under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, some of which are registrable and some not, e.g., Chapel Grove and Eastnor Placc areas. 4. Tenement Houses let in separate dwellings, but in which the dwellings are not separately assessed, or, if separately assessed, in which the dwellings do not differ in arrangment or construction from those in an ordinary tenement house, but which houses, it may be contended, are not registrable as a whole. 5. Working Class Flats habitually overcrowded or kept in an insanitary condition. (c) Underground Dwellings.—Attheendof the year there were on the Register 458 underground rooms which had been illegally occupied as dwellings, and had been ordered to be closed, and of which 193 inspections had been made and 71 re-inspections after notices served. Time is allowed to the occupants to these rooms to find rooms elsewhere, and during the time allowed the illegally occupied rooms are kept under observation and the number vacated or otherwise 106 occupied ascertained and reported. The houses' in which these dwellings are found are added to the register of registered tenement houses. (d) Common Lodging-houses. — There are 19 registered Common Lodginghouses in St. Pancras, and these are supervised by the London County Council, including the one Salvation Army Shelter in South St Pancras. Rowton Houses are not so registered; of these there are in St. Pancras one at the southern end of King's Cross Road, in South St. Pancras, and another at the northern end of Arlington Road, in West St. Pancras. (e) Canal Boat Dwellings.—During the year 59 visits of inspection were paid to the 31 wharves on the Regent's Canal. (f) Working Class Flats.—A list of the principal of these and the accommodation provided will he found in the Appendix to this Report. THE INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1903. Houses during the Year 1909.

Area No 1. —Somers Town. 1 (a).—Churchway Scheme.—In continuation of the previous Annual Reports on the subject of housing, this scheme was completed by the London County Council; the other schemes are moving as described here following. 1 (A).—Part of area west of Chulton Street and north of Drummond Street line.— The houses in this area were dealt with individually under the Public Health Act years ago. 1 (c).—Part of area east of Chalton Street.— In continuance of the history of the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place Schemes. The Schemes of 1898, amended in 1901, relating to those two areas were embodied in one Order by the Local Government Board, and a notice thereof published in the "London Gazette." The Midland Railway Company having acquired the Land in 1898, petitioned against the Order in December, 1905, as did also a leaseholder, and the Order of the Local Government Board sanctioning and embodying the schemes became "provisional." On the 17th February, 1906, the directors of the Midland Railway Company, by letter, suggested that the Borough Council should 107 endeavour to find another site for the erection of the new buildings for rehousing persons proposed to be disturbed under this scheme. The Local Government Board introduced a Bill into the House of Commons entitled " An Act to Confirm a Provisional Order of the Local Government Board Relating to the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras." This Act was passed on the 4th August 1906. It is provided in the Act (section 1) that "the Order set out in the schedule hereto shall be and the same is hereby confirmed and all the provisions thereof shall have full validity and force as from a date to be fixed by an Order of the Local Government Board, not being less than twelve months from the passing of this Act." Areas Nos. 2 and 3. Prospect Terrace and Brantome Place Order. —In the Order the number of persons to be displaced from these two areas was 1,165, and the number to be rehoused on the three sites scheduled in the Order was 842 persons. The position with regard to the three sites is as follows:— (a) Great College Street Site.—On this additional vacant site included in the Order of the Local Government Board for the purpose of housing part of the persons displaced from the Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace areas, Goldington Buildings were erected and opened in 1904. These buildings were described under the head of (f') Working Class Flats in the Annual Report for 1905, p. 108, and accommodate 332 persons. (b) Brantome Place Area.—On this site the buildings known as Flaxman Terrace were erected and opened in 1908. These buildings were described in the Annual Reports for 1907, p. 79, and 1908, p. 92, and accommodate 432 persons. (c) Prospect Terrace Area.—In continuation of the course of events recorded in the Annual Report for 1908, on the 20th April, 1909, the foundation stone .of the new buildings was laid by the Mayoress. The following is a description of the new buildings :— The dwellings are erected with a frontage of 265 feet to Prospect Terrace and 130 feet to Wellington Place, and contain a superficial area of about twofifths of an acre. At the rear of the building there is a large open space of an average width of 50 feet, which affords ample lighting and ventilation to the building, and at the same time can be used by the children of the tenants as a playground. The elevation, though of the sunniest character, is attractive in appearance, as advantage has been taken of the shape of the site to break the line of frontage into bays, and the broken sky line forms a pleasing feature in the design. The building is six storeys in height, including half basement and attic storeys, and is faced with red Leicester bricks relieved with dressings of artificial stone of a pale buff tint. 108 The half basement is as attractive as the ground floor, and there is a long slope planted with evergreens in front of the windows. The building is of fireproof construction throughout, the floors being formed with steel and concrete, and the pavings and landings finished with granolithic material. The walls of the staircases are faced with white tiles, ensuring an absolutely smooth and clean surface, requiring no annual expenditure for painting or distempering. The floors of the W.C.'s are laid with mosaic, and the walls tiled in the same way as the staircases. The buildings contain:—3G three-room tenements and 34 two-room tenements, containing 176 rooms, and will house 352 persons. All the tenements are self-contained, that is to say, each tenement has a separate scullery and W.C., and every tenement is entered from a lobby so as to give absolute privacy to the tenant. From this lobby access is obtained to the scullery and AV.C., and they are thus completely cut off from the living rooms. These lobbies are provided with a shelf and hat and coat hooks. The scullery, which is used as a kitchen, is fitted up with a washing trough and an independent copper for washing clothes, a larder, dresser, coal bunk, a small gas cooking range, and also an improved form of range. By lifting up a shutter in the middle of this range the fire can be transferred into the living room which adjoins the scullery, so that the tenants need only light one fire, which will serve for cooking and heating purposes. Every bedroom is fitted with a dress cupboard with shelves and pegs for hanging clothes thereon. The buildings are lighted with incandescent gas. The Superintendent is situated in a four-storey block adjoining the mainbuildings. The basement of this block contains a large drying room to enable the tenants to dry their clothes, for which a small charge is made; also twelve baths, a heating chamber and workshop. The baths are also open for the use of residents in the vicinity upon the game payment as the tenants. At the rear of the building there are situated a large number of perambulator and bicycle sheds for the use of the tenants, for which a charge of Id. or 2d. per week is made. The living rooms have an average area of 160 feet. The bedrooms of the two-room tenements have an average area of 125 feet. The two bedrooms of the three-room tenements have an average area of 108 feet and 102 feet respectively. The rents have been so adjusted as to make the undertaking self-supporting, involving no charge upon the rates. At the end of the year 1909, Prospect Terrace was completed, and opened by His "Worship the Mayor (Councillor E. T. Heron, J.P.). Thus the triple scheme of the Prospect Terrace and Brantome Place areas, supplemented by the Great College Street site, is now complete, the original representation having been made in 1891. 109 The original scheme displaced 1,165 persons, and the original order of the Local Government Board required re-housing accommodation to be provided for 842 persons. The three sets of buildings as now completed provide accommodation for 1,116 persons, that is, for 274 persons more than was originally required, and only 49 persons short of the original number displaced. The following particulars with regard to the buildings are of permanent interest. Situation. Building Contract (exclusive of the cost of land).

Compton Place Hunter Place, and Poplar Place.—In 1885 the houses in Poplar PJace were vacated and subsequently demolished, and the houses in Hunter Place and Compton Place have been vacated in pairs and groups and subsequently demolished, until the whole site bounded by the rears of the houses in Judd Street, Leigh Stseet, Marchmont Street and Compton Street has been cleared. A. most insanitary area has finally disappeared, and the site has now passed into the hands of the Metropolitan Police, and these insalubrious "Places" will be known no more, and their names will be forgotten. WEIR'S PASSAGE, EUSTON ROAD, N.W. The Health Committee reported on the 4th September, 1895, to the late Yestry of St. Pancras, that they had considered a representation of the Medical Officer of Health, made under Part 2 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, dated 8th August, 1895, that the dwelling-house premises, Nos. 1, 5, 7, 9, 11 (South Side), and Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (North Side), Weir's Passage, Chalton Street, Somers Town, appear to him to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. 112 These premises form part of the insanitary area, known as the Somers Town Area, east of Chalton Street, represented by the Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council on the 12th February, 1891, under Part 1 of the Act mentioned. Subsequently an inquiry was held by the direction of the Secretary of State, who finally decreed that so much of the area as lies to the east of Chalton Street should be dealt with by the Yestry under Part 2 of the Act, the County Council contributing one-third of the expense. At an inspection made by the Medical Officer of Health of the houses in Weir's Passage, in company with Lady Henry Somerset and her agent, it was agreed that something must be done on account of the condition of the houses referred to, and her Ladyship's agent expressed the opinion that the structural and decorative condition of such houses were beyond repair. Lady Henry Somerset thereupon promised that she would be very happy to support the Vestry in any manner in her power, in order to suppress what she regarded as an obnoxious nuisance. The Health Committee frequently viewed the dwelling-houses, and were of opinion that Nos. 1, 5, 7, 9 and 11 (South Side), and Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (.North Side), Weir's Passage, Chalton Street, which are used for dwelling purposes, are in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and recommended— That in the cases referred to, reported by the Medical Officer of Health, notices be given under Part 2 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, to the person causing the premises to be unfit for human habitation, as the case may be, to make the said dwelling-houses fit for human habitation ; and in default of compliance with the requisitions of such notices, such proceedings be taken as the solicitor may devise for prohibiting the use of the premises for human habitation, and for such penalties as the law provides. The following communication was subsequently received from the Vestry's Solicitors :— "48, Chancery Lane, London, W.C., 23rd December, 1895. "Dear Sir, "Insanitary Areas. "Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, JO and 11, Weirs Passage. "The adjourned summonses in respect of all these houses came before the Magistrate again on the 20th instant. The Magistrate then stated that he had inspected the whole of the premises on the 9th instant, when he had found some of them very recently touched up and repaired, so far as decorations, whitewashing, etc., went, and that in consequence he was not prepared to make closing orders now ; but he stated that he had made very careful notes upon the condition of all the houses, and was prepared to specify what he thought ought to be done by the owners immediately, in order to render the houses fit for habitation, and in such a condition as to ultimately avoid a closing order. "He then went through the houses seriatim, and we have obtained and now send a copy of his notes, which will give all information. 113 "The Magistrate declined to interfere with the closing order in respect of No. 5, made by consent on the 30th November, and declined to make further closing orders at present, but invited the owners of all the houses, except No. 5, to say if they would accept his suggestions. "The owner of No. 1, at once, through his counsel, accepted the conditions, and the owner of Nos. 7, 9, and 11, through his counsel, at once did the same. "The owner of Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 made strong objections, chiefly with a view to throwing the costs of the summonses so far upon the Vestry, but ultimately undertook to accept the Magistrate's suggestions. "All the summonses, except as to No. 5, were therefore adjourned until the 20th March next, when the Magistrate will hear evidence as to whether the suggested repairs, etc., have been carried out to his satisfaction, and the whole question of costs and whether closing orders will then be necessary or not will be decided. "From the remarks the Magistrate made, we gather that he would have been disposed to make the closing orders had the temporary repairs not been effected, and that he had something to say about the manner in which such repairs had been made immediately before his visit of inspection, and would take that part of the proceedings into consideration on the question of costs. "Yours truly, (Signed) CUNLIFFES & DAVENPORT." And later on this further communication was received:— "48, Chancery Lane, London, W.C., 20th March, 1896. " Dear Sir, "Insanitary Areas — Weirs Passage. "At the adjourned Summons this day, the Magistrate refused to make closing orders, and made no order as to costs. "These applications, therefore, are disposed of, each party paying their own costs. "Yours truly, (Signed) CUNLIFFES & DAVENPORT." On the 25th May, 1898, a letter was received by the late Vestry from Messrs. Day, Russell & Co., Solicitors to Lady Henry Somerset, in reply to a, communication to her Ladyship in regard to certain property in Somers Town, stating that the property dealt with by the scheme had been sold by her Ladyship to Mr. A. Bignold, of Princes Chambers, 56a, Pall Mall, S.W. The following Report, submitted by the Public Health Committee to the Borough Council, on 24th November, 1909, carries the history on:— 114 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W., 17th November, 1909. To the Public Health Committee, Mr. Chairman, Madam, and Gentlemen,— Report of the Chief Clerk ox the Legal Proceedings token icith a view to the closing of the du elling houses in Weirs Passage, Somers Town. I beg to report upon the legal proceedings taken with a view to the closing of the dwelling houses in Weirs Passage. W eirs Passage forms part of the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place areas for which improvement schemes under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part II., were approved and adopted by the late Vestry on May 11th, 1898, and amended by the Borough Council in 1901. On the 17th August, 1905. the Local Government Board issued their Order sanctioning these schemes. Upon notice of the Order being served on the owners of every part of the areas, petitions were presented to the Local Government Board by the freeholders of both areas, and also by one of the leaseholders affected by the schemes. The Order sanctioning the schemes therefore became Provisional. The Local Government Board, on the 13th June, 1906, introduced a Bill in the House of Commons to confirm the Provisional Order relating to the schemes in question. This Bill became law on the 4th August, 1906. It is provided in the Act (Section 1) that " the Order set out in the schedule hereto shall be and the same is hereby confirmed, and all the provisions thereof shall have full validity and force as from a date to be fixed by an Order of the Local Government Board not being less than twelve months from the passing of this Act." In the summer of 1908, Mr. Edgar Dudley, one of the Inspectors of the Local Government Board, visited the properties comprised in the schemes for the purpose of enabling the Board to decide whether the circumstances were such as to require an Order putting in force the provisions of the Saint Pancras (Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place) Order of 1906. On the 25th January, 1909, a communication was received from the Board, stating that having regard to the account given by Mr. Dudley of his inspections of these areas, the Board were disposed to think that the necessities of the case would be met for the present if the Borough Council succeeded in obtaining Closing Orders in respect of the dwelling houses in Weirs Passage, which the Inspector considered should cease to be inhabited. Upon the receipt of this letter, the Public Health Committee viewed the houses in Weirs Passage, and on their recommendation the Borougli Council resolved on the 17th March, 1909, that application be made to the Magistrate under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts for Closing Orders. On the 3rd June, the Medical Officer of Health represented the houses numbered 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 5, 7, 9, 11, Weirs Passage as unfit for human habitation. On the 7th July, Mr. d'Eyncourt, the Magistrate sitting at the Clerkenwell Police Court, granted summonses against the owners of the above-mentioned 115 dwelling houses, that they were in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and were not reasonably capable of being made fit. The summonses came before Mr. d'Eyncourt on the 21st July, and after hearing evidence on behalf of the Council, he decided to view the houses. On the 26th October he gave judgment. In the course of his decision he stated that he examined the houses front and back, the staircases, the cellars, the inhabitants, as thoroughly as he could, and he tried to bear in mind the evidence given before him. No doubt the place had been cleaned up, the doors and windows opened, and everything made to look as nice as could be. But allowing for all that, he had come to the conclusion that he could not make an order. They were not desirable residences in any sense of the word, but there was a long, great gulf between that and place - not fit for habitation. They were dark and closed in, being houses of no length, but most of the rooms abutting on the passage were used as workshops, very few as sleeping rooms. Some years ago, he understood, Mr. Horace Smith, had come to the same conclusion, after ordering certain work to be done. But, of course, things had progressed since then. The only objection he saw was to the cellars opening on to the streets so that any rubbish might be thrown thrown down. He suggested that means might be found to prevent this. The Magistrate dismissed the nine summonses, and awarded the defendants £2 14s. Od. costs on each summons (£21 6s. Od. in all). I am, &c., A. POWEL COKE, Chief Clerk. The decision of the Magistrate was forwarded to the Local Government Board, and on the 9th March, 1910, a further inspection of Weirs Passage was made by Mr. E. Leonard on hehalf of the Board, but the result of his inquiry has not been communicated to your Council. 4.—SCHOOLS. At the 42 grant-receiving schools, 36 inspections and 2 re-inspections, were made during the year by the Woman Inspector. The Board of Education having decided to relieve Local Authorities from the obligation to provide school places for children under the age of five years, the age at which compulsory school attendance begins, many authorities are ceasing to admit school children from 3 to 5 years of age Infectious Diseases as concerning schools is dealt with in Part III., § 3, Isolation and Exclusion.

Factories.—The Men Inspectors had 413 and the Women Inspectors 107 factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water service, sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During the year 91 and 12 inspections of factories respectively were made, and 26 re-inspections after notices served. Workshops. — The Men Inspectors had 1238 (apart from bakehouses) and the Woman Inspector 404 workshops (apart from laundries) on the Registers for periodical inspection. During the year 797 and 35 inspections respectively of these premises were made, and 277 and 5 re-inspections after notices. Workplaces.—These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, laundries and domestic workshops and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaces.—The Woman Inspector has 71 of these on the Register, of which 23 inspections were made, These places vary in number from year to year, and according to the season of the year. Laundries. — On the Register are 74 laundries at which the Woman Inspector made 3 inspections and 2 re-inspections. Restaurant Kitchens.—Of these the Men Inspectors had 163 and the Woman Inspector 158 on the Registers. At the former 133 inspections and 83 re-inspections were made and at the latter 2 inspections and 1 re-inspection. Bakehouses.—At the commencement of the year there were 133 workshopbakehouses. Of these and of the three factory bakehouses, and the three bakehouses in hotels, 321 inspections and 225 re-inspections were made.

Totals 6788 1177 10 6 The numbers employed are approximate only, and probably understate the case. They refer to women only, with the exception of about 120 men working in their own homes. The year has been one of exceptional pressure in various directions, and it has not been possible to give to the inspection of industrial premises so much attention as is desirable. The additional work imposed by the Compulsory Notification of Consumption by Poor Law Authorities has been considerable as regards visiting, report work, and general organisation. It is hoped that the help given very generously from voluntary sources may soon render possible 123 the giving of full attention to other matters in my hands. I submit a separate Report on the Consumption Work of the year. An attempt has been made to study more fully and carefully the home conditions of verminous and generally neglected children, and it is desired to continue and extend this work still further as time permits. The problem is by no means as simple as is generally supposed. Ill-health, motherlessness, defective sight, poverty, ignorance, mental inefficiency, and absence of facilities for cleanliness are contributory causes which cannot be removed by a single compulsory cleansing, supplemented by a ten shilling fine, as provided by the Children Act. Cleanliness is not a state to be permanently attained by one effort, hut a condition unstable in the extreme. Teaching and encouragement, combined with facilities for cleanliness attached, not to the temporary and artificial life of the school, but to the permanent and real life of the home, are needed in addition to the present provisions for the punishment of the wilfully negligent. One useful measure which might be recommended to the schools is the sending to the Children's Baths before re-admission to the schools of all children known to have been away "hopping.'' In this work, more particularly in the case of the motherless children, voluntary help will be of great value, and no doubt the Children's Care Committees and other social agencies of the district will take much interest in the whole of the questions involved.

H. Dickinson, M.P., with a view of amending the law relating to combined drainage in London, which for many years past has been in a most unsatisfactory state. The Bill was down for second reading on several occasions, but no progress was made during the session. It was re-introduced on the 30lh March, 1909, but again it failed to secure a second reading. 129 The experience of the last Parliament only too plainly shows that there is little prospect of a Private Member's Bill dealing with the difficulties created by the definitions of "sewer" and "drain" becoming law without the cooperation of the responsible Minister of His Majesty's Government. Drainage By-laws.—A. communication, dated 16th March, 1909, was received from the Borough of Hampstead drawing attention to an appeal of that Council (Kershaw r. Brooks) which came before the Divisional Court by way of Special Case from the decision of Mr. Plowden dismissing certain summonses issued (1) under the Plan By-laws, and (2) under the Drainage By-laws made by the London County Council. The question for decision was as to who was the proper person to be brought before the Magistrate for infringement of these By-laws. The Council summoned the responsible person actually carrying out the work, and the summonses were dismissed by the Magistrate on the ground that they should have been issued against the person who ordered the work to be done. The Divisional Court sustained the decision of the Magistrate, with the result that the hitherto invariable practice of proceeding against the responsible person who actually carries out the works will be no longer open to the Borough Councils, but inquiries will have to be entered upon as to who is responsible for the work being done, i.e., who has given the order. As the matter was of such serious importance, the Hampstead Borough Council communicated with the London County Council with a view to the By-laws being amended so as to validate the practice which has hitherto existed, and to make it clear, either by an interpretation clause or otherwise, that a builder or contractor in control of the works shall, in addition to the existing remedy against the owner, be responsible in cases of breaches of the above By-laws, and asked this Council to support the action taken. Your Council concurred in the step taken by the Hampstead Borough Council and on 16th June, 1909, recommended that the London County Council be asked to define whose duty it shall be to comply with the By-laws as to the giving of notice and as to the deposit of drainage plans. On the 20th October, 1909, a letter was received from the London County Council, stating that the Council had been in communication with the Local Government Board as to the desirableness of securing an amendment of the By-law in order to place upon the builder the responsibility for complying with the By-laws above mentioned. The Board replied, stating that they would be prepared to consider the terms of any By-law proposed to meet the decision referred to, although they were not satisfied that it was necessary to amend the By-laws, the effect of the decisions in the case of Kershaw r. Brooks, and in that of Brown v. Edmonton (45 J. P. 553) being to show that the applicability of the By-law to a particular person must be judged by the facts in each case. The London County Council asked to be favoured with the views of this Council on the opinion expressed by the Local Government Board. Previous to the decision in the case of Kershaw r. Brooks referred to above, it was the practice of this Authority to proceed against the builder only as the responsible person for an infringment of the By-laws in question, and 130 your Council were strongly of opinion that the duty of complying with the By-laws in regard to the deposit of plans and the giving of notice should only be placed upon the person executing the work. Your Council resolve that the London County Council be informed that it is the opinion of this Authority that the onus of complying with the By-laws in regard to the deposit of drainage plans, and the giving of notice before the commencement of sanitary work, should be upon the builder and not the owner, and that the By-laws made by the London County Council in regard to drainage and sanitary work should be amended if necessary to make this clear. This was approved by your Council on the 24th November, 1909, but the By-laws have not yet been amended to meet the difficulty created by the decision in Kershaw v. Brooks. Your Council received a Report of the Medical Officer of Health upon the subject of further amendment of the Drainage By-laws from the Public Health Committee on loth July, 1909, to the following effect:— In accordance with the instructions of your Committee of the 31st March last with regard to the By-laws made by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, Section 202, and the Metropolis Management Acts Amendment (By-laws) Act, 1899, I beg to report as follows:— A communication dated the ltith March, 1909, has been received from the Borough of Hampstead drawing attention to an Appeal of that Council (Kershaw v. Brooks) which recently came before the Divisional Court by way of Special Case from the decision of Mr. Plowden dismissing certain summonses issued (1) under the Plan By-laws and (2) under the Drainage By-laws made by the London County Council. The question for decision was as to who was the proper person to be brought before the Magistrate for infringement of these By-laws. The Council summoned the responsible person actually carrying out the work, and the summonses were dismissed by the Magistrate on the ground that they should have been issued against the person who ordered the work to be done. The Divisional Court sustained the decision of the Magistrate, with the result that the hitherto invariable practice of proceeding against the responsible person who actually carries out the works will be no longer open to the Borough Councils, but inquiries will have to be entered upon as to who is responsible for the work being done i.e., uho has given the order. As the matter is of such serious importance, the Hampstead Borough Council have communicated with the London County Council with a view to the By-laws being amended so as to validate the practice which has hitherto existed, and to make it clear, either by an interpretation clause or otherwise, that a builder or contractor in control of the works shall, in addition to the existing reinedy against the owner, be responsible in cases of breaches of the above By-laws, and ask this Council to support the action taken. It is unhesitatingly desirable that the St. Pancras Borough Council should support the action of the Hampstead Borough Council. The interpretation clause is not only required for the purpose of making it clear who is the person who should deposit plans and the person who should comply with the requirements of construction of drainage, but also for the purpose of making it clear what is a rain-water pipe, a waste pipe, a soil 131 pipe, etc. There are no definitions of these, and the only thing that one can gather from the context of the By-laws is that a rain-water pipe carries rain water only; that, a waste pipe carries only waste water from a bath, lavatory, or sink; and a soil pipe only carries water soiled by excretal matters. Rain-water pipes and waste pipes are not allowed to he in structural continuity with a drain, but the highest point of a drain is the top of the vent pipe, and the soil pipe and the vent pipe are in structural continuity with a drain, but neither a soil pipe nor a vent pipe appears to be a drain, nor is there anything to show where a soil pipe ceases and a drain begins. There is no reason why a soil pipe or a drain should not be vertical, oblique, or horizontal in direction; mere verticality cannot convert the drain into a soil pipe, nor can horizontality convert a soil pipe into a drain, as either pipe of either kind may assume either direction. The only conclusion that it appears possible to draw is that a soil pipe becomes a drain as soon as it is joined by a branch, whether that branch carries soil, waste water, or surface water; one of these, or any two, or all three. Similarly it is possible for a branch of a drain tocarry only waste water or only rain water, and from the trapped gully where it commences to run horizontally or vertically or obliquely to the point where it joins the main drain or another branch. There does not appear to be any valid reason why the gully or gullies receiving waste water or rain water should not be situated at a roof level or at any higher level than the absolute ground, provided thai the piping is in iron. This brings me to the point upon which I desire to lay emphasis, namely, that it is possible to construct drainage much more advantageously under disadvantageous circumstances in iron than in earthenware, and that it is desirable that special by-laws or provisions should be made for construction in iron. For instance, it is possible to conceive an iron drainage system with a manhole situated on the first floor and gullies slung on the wall, in fact, this is the manner in which the Officers' Building of the London and North-Western Railway Company on the east side of Cardington Street is drained, being built on iron columns from the ground upward, so that the basement and ground floor are absent in order to make room for rolling stock, and so that the drainage is raised sufficiently to discharge into the sewer in Cardington Street. This is an exceptional case perhaps, but there are other cases which illustrate similar requirements, and the construction of drainage in iron gets over many difficulties which would be insuperable if constructed in earthenware and carried out scrictly in accordance with the By-laws as at present framed and interpreted. For instance, it should be permissible to discharge a trapped iron gully into an iron soil pipe, provided that the point of junction is furnished with a clearing eye, gas and water tight, and that the trap of the gully is secured against syphonage and kept constantly charged by a waste pipe or pipes, and not only by a rain water pipe or pipes, and that the gully opening is situated in the open air. I beg to recommend that in addition to supporting Hampstead in asking the Loudon County Council to amend the Drainage By-laws so as to define whose duty it shall be to comply with the By-laws as to the depositing of plans of drainage, and to comply with the By-laws as to the construction of drainage, that the St. Pancras Borough Council should also ask the London County Council to insert in the interpretation clause definitions of rain water pij e, waste pipe, soil pipe; and also provide by 132 additional By-laws or additional provisions for special circumstances requiring iron drainage to be constructed instead of earthenware, and the conditions of such construction. The attention of your Committee should also he directed to the particular By-laws referring to sub-soil drainage. There is no provision against the reflux of sewage into a sub-soil drain, either from a choked sewer, a blocked manhole, or a stopped drain. Some such provision as this is required : - "He shall cause such traps to be provided with a suitable ball or valve "which will effectually prevent any reflux of sewage into the sub-soil drain "from the sewer or drain carrying sewage into which the sub-soil drain "discharges; and he shall provide 011 the sub-soil drain side of the trap a "manhole, and along the bottom of this manhole a half channel pipe, and "over the top of this manhole a grating, so that any reflux of sewage into "the sub-soil drain can be readily seen." I beg to recommend that a communication be made to the County Council accordingly. Another point to which I would beg to call attention is that By-law 3 (first paragraph) of the Drainage By-laws is constantly being interpreted to mean that a rain-water pipe must be taken directly downwards to discharge over or into a trapped gully, and often inside a house. For years I have advised architects, builders, and others to "keep the rain or surface waters as high as possible as long as possible," in order to retain as much head of water or gravitation as possible, so as to enable the rain water to be carried from roof to roof and surface to surface to any necessary distance to the lowest open area where a gully may be placed. I beg to recommend that in order to facilitate this, to the end of the first paragraph of By-law 3 of the Drainage By-laws, which regulates the discharge of rain-water pipes, the following words be added:— "Or over a channel, or into a hopper head, or on to a roof, or other "impervious properly levelled and drained surface." On the 12th September, 1906, I reported to your Public Health Committee upon the particular By-laws regulating the size of soil pipes and vent pipes. This report was considered and approved by the Borough Council on the 19th September, i906, and forwarded to the County Council. The substance of this report was condensed and reproduced in the Annual Report for 190G as follows:— "Drainage By-laws, Regulating the Size of Pipes.—Builders still "continue to complain that they are allowed to put up a 3½-in. soil pipe "and a 3½-in. vent pipe to ventilate a 4-in. drain, but if they ventilate a "4-in. drain, not having a soil pipe but a branch W.C. drain on the same "level, they are compelled to make the branch 4-in. diameter, and the " vent pipe 4-in. diameter. "In other words, if the vertical vent pipe is the continuation of a "4-in. horizontal drain, it must be 4-in. in diameter, but if to this vertical "vent pipe a W.C. is connected it becomes a soil pipe, and may, together "with the soil pipe, be reduced to 3½-in. in diameter. 133 "A soil pipe is a direct continuation and part of a drain, that "portion which is horizontal being called drain, and that which is vertical "being called soil pipe, so that a soil pipe is a vertical drain, and should "be subject to similar provisions. "The anomaly was typically apparent in the case of the Teachers' "House at All saints School, Pancras Street (see plan No. 10,270), where "the Committee declined to take any action against the builder for "putting up a 3½-in ventilating pipe to the drain, because the W.C. was "on the basement level instead of the first floor. "The continual irritation and annoyance caused by this anomaly is "ot experienced by the London County Council but by the Borough "Council, which is the executive authority; and I feel sure that the "London County Council would rectify the wrong upon the representa"tion of the sufferers if sufficient pressure were brought to bear. "A great amount of confusion and complaining would be avoided if "a minimum diameter of 4-in. were adopted for soil pipes in By-law 11, "pars. 5 and 2, or if a minimum diameter of 3½-in were adopted for "drains in By-law 4, pars. 3, 9 and 10, and for vent pipes in By-law 8, "par. 4. One of these alternatives should be adopted." I beg to recommend that representation be again made to the London County Council accordingly. This Report was forwarded to the London County Council. § 8—STORAGE AND REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE MATTERS. CLEANSING AND SCAVENGING. Refuse Removal.—A letter was received from the Local Government Board, dated the 15th Octobcr, requesting that the Medical Officer of Health may be instructed to prepare a Report upon the subject of the collection and disposal of house refuse and forward a copy lathe Board. This letter was referred by the Public Health Committee of the previous Council to the Medical Officer of Health. In order to comply with this instruction I addressed an inquiry to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, and I received the following reply:— "The collection of the whole of the house refuse of the Borough is done by "the Council's own staff and no part by Contractors. The condition applying "generally throughout the Borough as to frequency of removal is that imposed "by the by-law, namely, collection each week, but in the various streets named "by the Commissioner of Police as within the special limits, daily collection is "made where householders choose to avail themselves of it, but it is not all "who do so. More frequent collection is made from the hospitals, large hotels, "and from many blocks of flats which are visited in some cases twice, in other "cases three times a week. The monthly statements published in the Minutes "are the only statements submitted to the Highways Committee for the "Council." 1:34 I have had the monthly statements published in the Minutes of the Borough Council tabulated in quarterly returns in each of the Divisions of the Borough, and these again summarised into an annual return, both with regard to collection and destruction of house refuse, and these tables I beg to attach hereto as appendices lettered "a" and "b," the former in regard to 1908 and the latter in regard to 1909.

J. Smith, the Town Clerk, in October last, the following twelve British cities do not use salt to assist the removal of the snow from the carriage-ways:—Aberdeen, Bradford, Bristol, Dundee, Greenock, Inverness, Leeds, Leicester, Leith, Newcastle, Norwich, Paisley. At Greenock the snow is carted away immediately. At Dundee it is carted and deposited in the river or sewers or on vacant ground, and a mixture of salt and sand is used in the main thoroughfares to prevent horses from slipping during frosty weather. The use of salt in Inverness is forbidden undar a penalty by the Burgh Police Act, 1892. Salt is used on the carriage-ways in Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hull, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, and Sheffield. The following Continental cities do not use salt for the purpose of getting rid of a snowfall:—Berlin, Berne, Breslau, Christiania, Cologne, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Ilamburg, and Munich, whilst Dresden only does so in exceptional cases. Snow ploughs are employed at Breslau, Cologne, Dresden, and Frankfurt. The cities where salt is used are Amsterdam, Antwerp, The Hague, Leipzig, and Paris; the streets of Paris are grouped in three classes of "urgency," and the salt is spread thereon in order of class. I11 regard to footpaths, Edinburgh is the only British city where salt is used to any great extent for the removal of snow. At Hull it is employed for this purpose, but only to expedite matters when the snow is already thawing. It is used on the footpaths at Liverpool during the night only, the slush being flushed away by 8 a.m. It is also used occasionally at Dundee and Greenock, but with these exceptions none of the British cities use salt on the footways. In Continental cities salt is used sparingly on the footpaths at Dresden, The Hague, and Leipzig, but not at all in the remaining cities. At Breslau and Paris the inhabitants are required to clear the pavements; at the former place salt is forbidden, and at the latter it is required that sand, ashes, or slag should be spread. In the case of ten British cities — Aberdeen, Bradford, Bristol, Greenock, Inverness, Leeds, Leicester, Newcastle, Nottingham, and Paisley—the opinion is that a general use of salt for the removal of snow is objectionable from the point of view of public health. In the majority of these ten cases the cold slush that is formed is regarded as being at least unpleasant for, if not dangerous to pedestrians, and as distinctly injurious to the feet of animals. At Edinburgh and Hull the medical officers are strongly of opinion that the use of salt is objectionable; the city engineers, on the other hand, are in favour of its application. At Hull the city engineer's opinion is that without applying salt it is impossible to maintain traffic on wood-paving. The city road surveyor of Edinburgh considers that salt does no appreciable injury to paved roads, but tends to break the surface of macadamised roads. The medical officers of Dundee, Liverpool, and Manchester consider that no actual harm results from the method of applying the salt in their respective cities, though in the case of Manchester it is stated that, no doubt, people with defective boots suffer severely. 139 In the opinion of the authorities responsible for the clearing of the snow at Antwerp, Berlin, Dresden, and Hamburg, the use of salt is prejudicial to public health. The reply from Antwerp states that if small quantities of salt are mixed with large quantities of ashes the practice is not objectionable when applied to roads first cleared of the snow. Some years ago at Amsterdam certain of the tramcar horses' feet bacame diseased through the use of salt, but 110 complaints of injury to persons have been received. Reports from Paris, Christiania, Cologne, and The Hague do not record any objections to the use of salt. Removal of Fish Offal.—The difficulty of dealing with offensive fish-offal under the by-laws for prescribing, etc., the removal of offensive matter or liquid, etc. (Section 16, P.H.L.A. 1891), still continues when the offal is removed in the daytime. I would suggest that the case would be met by an additional proviso under the by-laws mentioned somewhat to the following effect —"This by-law shall "not apply to any person removing or carrying the offal of fish, poultry, or "game, and using or causing to be used therefor portable metal receptacles, "and which receptacles are removed and carried in an airtight condition." § 9.—NUISANCES, &c. Reqent's Canal Wat"r.—Specimens of water taken from the Regent's Canal within the Borough were sent for analysis to the Public Analyst. The general tone of his reports was that the water was sewage-polluted, but that the contamination was not such as to cause a nuisance. Offensive Trades. —The two licensed noxious trade premises in St. Pancras have been regularly inspected, and the tallow-melting works in Tudor Place have been kept under continual observation. Effluvia Businesset.—In addition to the above businesses producing offensive effluvia, the businesses of a vendor of fried fish, a fish-curer, and a rag and bone dealer have been brought under control by Section 10, Part II., Sanitary Provisions, of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. By this section the County Council may make by-laws for regulating the conduct of these businesses, and with respect to the premises, utensils, and appliances used in connection with these businesses, and it is the duty of the Borough Councils to enforce these by-laws. The framing of these by-laws is under consideration. 140 § 10.- SUMMONSES. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (except in respect of Food). Situation of Property. Offence.

The dairies, cowsheds, and milk shops, the slaughter-houses, the places -where foods are prepared, and the marketing places have been regularly visited and inspected. The markets and marketing streets have also been regularly inspected on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. Bakehouses, restaurants, kitchens, and similar workplaces where food is prepared, being also controlled by the Factory and Workshop Acts, have been dealt with under Part IV. Food Barrow and Stalk.—A letter dated the 28th June, addressed by the Clerk of the Council to the Town Clerk, states that Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, regulates the sanitary circumstances of premises on which such food as is sold or prepared for sale, and premises such as yards, stables, or arches where food is stored to be sold by costermongers on barrows, can be dealt with under this section, but it does not apply to barrows and other vehicles on which food is exposed for sale. That the Committee of the Council is of opinion that legislation should be obtained -enabling Sanitary Authorities to ensure the observation of proper sanitary regulations in regard to articles of food exposed or deposited for sale in the streets and other places to which the provisions of Section 8 of the Act of 1908 do not apply. That the Committee would be glad to know whether the Metropolitan Boroughs are in favour of the proposed extension of the authority given by Section 8 of the Act of 1908, would welcome any suggestions as to the best methods of the regulation of the sanitary circumstances of barrows and stalls, and would be glad to receive a reply to the communication not later than the 8th July, in order that the proposals may be submitted to the County Council in time for the promotion of legislation in the next Session of Parliament. On the 8th July, 1909, your Council was of opinion that control over the sanitary circumstances of fixed premises on which food is sold or prepared for sale or stored should be extended to movable conveyances such as barrows and stalls. Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, as to the control now exercisable over fixed food premises, runs as follows:— LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1908. Section 8. Sanitary Regulations for Premises used for Sale, etc., of Food for Human Consumption. (1) From and after the passing of this Act the following provisions shall apply to any room, shop, or other part of a building within the County in which any article, whether solid or liquid, intended or adapted for the food of man is sold or exposed for sale, or deposited for the purpose of sale, or of preparation for sale, or with a view to future sale:— (a) No urinal, water closet, earth closet, privy, ashpit, or other like sanitary convenience shall be within such room, shop, or other part of a. 142 building, or shall communicate therewith except through the open air or through an intervening ventilated space. (b) No cistern for supplying water to such room, shop, or other part of a building shall be indirect communication with and directly discharge into any such sanitary convenience. (c) No drain or pipe for carrying off fæeal or sewage matter shall have any inlet or opening within such room, shop, or other part of a building. (d) No such room, shop, or other part of a building shall be used as a sleeping: place, and so far as may be reasonably necessary to prevent risk of the infection or contamination of any such article as aforesaid, no sleeping place shall adjoin such room, shop, or other part of a building and communicate therewith, except through the open air or through an intervening ventilated space. (e) Refuse or filth, whether solid or liquid, shall not be deposited or allowed to accumulate in any such room, shop, or other part of a building, except so far as may be reasonably necessary for the proper carrying on of trade or business. (f) Due cleanliness shall be observed in regard to such room, shop, or other part of a building, and all articles, apparatus, and utensils therein, and shall be observed by persons engaged in such room, shop, or other part of a building. (2) If any person occupies, or lets, or knowingly suffers to be occupied any such room, shop, or other part of a building wherein any of the conditions prohibited by this Section exist, or does or knowingly permits any act or thing therein in contravention of this Section, he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding for a first offence twenty shillings, and for every subsequent offence five pounds, and in either case to a daily penalty not exceeding twenty shillings. In suggesting regulations for the control of barrows and stalls on the same line as shops and other places, it will be desirable to follow the Sub-sections of this Section— (a) No barrow or stall from which food is sold should be allowed to be stationed immediately adjoining a urinal, water closet, earth closet, privy, ashpit, or oilier like sanitary convenience. (b) Any water used in connection with any barrow or stall from which food is sold should be clean water contained in a clean receptacle, and such water should be renewed, and such receptacle cleansed sufficiently often to maintain them in a cleanly condition. Barrows and stalls from which are sold shell fish already prepared for food, or vegetables eaten without being cooked (such as watercress, lettuce, radishes, celery, etc.), should be provided with at least one special receptacle of pure clean water, and no impure or unclean water should be used for such shell fish or vegetables. 143 (c) No barrow or stall from which food is sold should be allowed to bestationed at, over, or adjoining any opening into any sewer or drain. (d) No food intended to be sold from a barrow or stall should be deposited, stored, or prepared in any place used as a sleeping place, or any place where food is liable to become infected, or contaminated, or polluted. (e) Refuse or filth, whether solid or liquid, should not be deposited or accumulated at or adjoining any barrow or stall from which food is sold, except so far as may be reasonably necessary for the proper carrying on of the trade or business, and any such deposit or accumulation should be placed in a proper receptacle. (f) Due cleanliness should be observed in regard to any barrow or stall, and all articles, apparatus, and utensils thereat, and should bo observed by all persons engaged in or about such barrows and stalls. Licensed Premises.—Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 8, there are sanitary regulations for premises where food is sold or exposed for sale, or deposited for the purpose of sale, or of preparation for sale for human consumption. (See above.) Under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, the sanitary conditions of workplaces are subject to supervision, these sanitary conditions including (a) cleanliness, (b) air space, (c) ventilation, and (d) drainage of floors. A circular letter of the Home Office (3rd issue), December, 1904, states that kitchens of restaurants, etc., though they are not workshops, come within the meaning of the term workplaces. For the purpose of enabling your Council to consider the question of the inspection of hotels, restaurants, beer-houses, and public houses, the Sanitary Inspectors made inquiries in each of the sub-divisions of the wards and divisions of the Borough as to the preparation and service of food on each of the licensed premises, with the result shown in the accompanying table. (See below). From the table it will be seen that there is a total of 318 licensed premises, of which 4 are hotels, 4 restaurants, 7 refreshment houses, 43 beer-houses, and 260 public-houses or licensed victuallers. In the 4 hotels and the 4 restaurants, and 5 of the 7 refreshment houses, lunches, dinners, teas or suppers are served; and in the other two only food which is prepared off the premises is served. Of the 43 beer-houses, in 14 lunches, dinners, teas, suppers and snacks are served, and in the remaining 29 food prepared off the premises is sold. Of the 260 public-houses, in 129 lunches, dinners, teas, suppers and snacks are served, and in 131 food prepared off the premises is sold. There is nothing in the regulations or sanitary requirements of an onerous nature, but a licensed victualler, as host, is required to provide proper accommodation for his guests, and Licensing Magistrates usually require evidence that proper and sufficient sanitary accommodation is provided on licensed victuallers' premises. On the 23rd February, 1910, your Council resolved that each of the 318 licensed premises in the Borough be inspected and reported upon as to whether they comply with the provisions of Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908 144 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.

Nursery/ Milks.—As in previous years during the month of July, in accordance with the resolution of the Council, thirty samples of nursery milks were obtained and examined bacteriologically and chemically. In each case half-apint of milk was purchased, and drawn or poured directly into a bottle provided by the Inspector, which bottle having been previously thoroughly cleansed and repeatedly rinsed with hot and cold clean water, and a cork tied round the neck thoroughly sterilised by high pressure of steam and hot air current in a disinfecting chamber and corked in the chamber before being removed. These bottles after cooling were packed in ice in a portable metal case holding four bottles at a time and were carried to the places where specimens of milk were procured, and when tilled and numbered were forthwith taken to the Laboratories, and the bacteriological and chemical examinations were immediately commenced. The result of the sampling and examinations are contained in a tabulated form in the Appendices attached hereto, and lettered " A," " B," " C," and " D." " A " shows the price and source of the sample of nursery milk purchased ; " B " results of the bacteriological examples of the samples ; " 0 " results of the chemical examination; and " D " results of further sampling and analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of the unsatisfactory samples in Table " C." An analysis of the Reports of this year and of previous years shows the results set out in the following tables:— 1. — Volume of apparent filth. Volume per million parts. 1907. 1908. 1909.

This Order, which was sent to the local authorities in Great Britain under the Diseases of Animals Acts, 1894 to 1903, accompanied by a circular letter, and this letter is to be followed later by another which is to treat more particularly of points of administrative detail, the first circular dealing only with the broader aspects of the subject. It is pointed out that were it possible in this country to eradicate tuberculosis from milch cattle, a material step forward would be taken in the campaign against the disease in man ; but, it is added, that operations aimed at the diminution or eradication of animal tuberculosis must be carried out with due regard to the importance of securing the continuance of an adequate rnilk-supply, and of avoiding disorganisation of the important industry concerned. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries has provided that the proceedings shall, in the first place, be limited to the destruction of cows which are suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, which are " emaciated from tuberculosis," or which are proved to be yielding tuberculous milk, all three of which conditions are known to disseminate freely the germs of the disease. It has also been determined by the provisions of Article 3 of the Order that the veterinary inspector of the local authority will be able, in cases where a suspected bovine animal is in question, to examine other animals which, in his opinion, present clinical symptoms of the disease ; and, as regards such animals, he may, but only with the written consent of the owner, apply the tuberculin test. In.all cases, power is conferred upon the veterinary inspector to take samples of milk, fnoces, urine, and abnormal discharges, with a view of submitting them to bacteriological examination. The provisions relative to the subject of compensation for compulsory slaughter are most important. If the animal proves on slaughter not to be tuberculous, the compensation to be paid is that of the full value of the animal plus 20s., and when tuberculosis is found the degree of compensation is to depend upon the extent and distribution of the tuberculous lesions, the general standard adopted being that proposed by the Royal Commission of 1898, which set out the conditions under which the whole carcasses or only parts thereof were to be seized. Under this arrangement an animal is deemed to have been suffering from " advanced tuberculosis: (a) when there is miliary tuberculosis in both lungs; (b) when tuberculous lesions are present on the pleura or peritoneum ; (e) w lien tuberculous lesions are present in the muscular system or in the lymphatic glands embedded in or between the muscles ; or (d) when the carcass is emaciated and tuberculous lesions are present. When, therefore, this technically " advanced " tuberculosis is discovered, the local authority has to pay to the owner a sum equal to one-fourth of the value of the animal or the sum of £2, whichever sum is the greater, but after deducting therefrom one-half of the costs of valuation and examination of the carcass. If, however, the examination after slaughter shows that the animal, although tuberculous, was not suffering from "advanced" tuberculosis, the owner is paid a sum equal to three-fourths of the value of the animal, less one-half the expenses referred to above. As regards the precautions to be adopted with respect to milk, it is laid down by Article 8 that the milk of any cow which is, or appears to be, suffering from chronic udder disease or emaciation from tuberculosis, shall not be mixed with other milk until such cow has been examined by a veterinary inspector, and until the owner has been notified that the provisions of this Article have ceased to apply to the cow. It is further 155 ordered that all milk to which this Article applies shall be boiled or otherwise sterilised, and the utensils which contain it shall be thoroughly cleansed with boiling water. Provision is also made by Article 9 of the Order for the detention and isolation of suspected animals. (See also Part VI. of this Report—Legislation, § 3 Orders.) Dirty Milk.—On Monday, 14th February, 1910, Inspector Osborne was inspecting and sampling at Euston Station. He found one churn belonging to a wholesale firm to contain milk that was not clean, but having been shaken up it was not sufficiently visibly dirty to seize immediately under the Public Health Act. He called the attention of the employee in charge of the milk to its colour, and the employee replied : " That is farm-yard dirt; it will come out in straining!" Inspector Osborne watched the course of events, and saw the employee plunge the milk to stir it, take a sample, and then pour portions of it into several other churns and mix it with other milks in the churns ready for delivery to the retail dealers. It is evident that straining is regarded as a panacea for dirty milk. What really happens is that the filth is washed out of the farm-yard (debrix and becomes more or less invisible, and then the debris is strained out of the milk, and is very much cleaner than when it was put in. So far as wholesomeness in concerned, there is no advantage in straining out the farm-yard dibrvs from dirty milk. It is a positive disadvantage, as it renders the dirt invisible, and analysis, bacteriological and chemical, is then the only means of discovery. FOOD DESTROYED.

The control sample is not a sample of the suspected milk, but it affords evidence in somedegree of the kind of milk supplied by the guarantor. The Board of Agriculture point out that the repeal of the "Warranty Clauses is demanded by those who desire to strengthen the law as to fraudulent adulteration as well as those who desire to protect the farmer. It is alleged that certain dealers and milk sellers are adulterating milk and selling the milk which they know to be adulterated, relying on those Clauses to afford an almost certain way of escape in case they are prosecuted. 159 Summonses.—Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.

The object of this Act as stated in its title is " to amend the law relating to " the Housing of the Working Classes, to provide for the making of Town " Planning Schemes, and to make further provision with respect to the " appointment and duties of County Medical Officers of Health, and to provide " for the establishment of Public Health and Housing Committees of County " Councils." It is divided into four Parts and six Schedules, but Parts II. and III. which relate to town planning and to County Medical Officers, etc., do not directly concern Metropolitan Borough Councils. The Act came into force on the 3rd December, 1909. The chief provisions of the Act affecting the Metropolitan Borough Councils are summarised below. Part III. of the principal Art to take effect without adoption. Part III. of the principal Act, i.e., the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, as amended by the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1900, could only be put into operation in araas for which it had been formally adopted. The effect of Section 1 of the new Act is that Part III. of the principal Act extends to and takes effect in every urban or rural district or other place in England and Wales for which it has not been adopted, as if it had been so adopted. Acquisition of land for purpose of Part III. of the principal Act. Prior to the passing of the new Act a local Authority could only acquire land otherwise than by agreement for the purpose of Part III of the principal Act by means of a Provisional Order, which was of no effect until confirmed by Parliament. Now, however, under the provisions of Section 2(1) and (2) of the new Act a local authority may be authorised to purchase land compulsorily for these purposes by means of an order submitted to the Board and •confirmed by them in accordance with Schedule 1 to the Act, and this procedure is substituted for the former procedure for the same purpose. By Section 2 (3) of the new Act the Council are expressly empowered, with the consent of, and subject to any conditions imposed by, the Board, to acquire land by agreement for the purposes of Part III. of the principal Act, notwithstanding that the land is not immediately required for these purposes. This enactment only enables the Council to acquire land by agreement, and doss not extend to compulsory purchase. Loans by Public Works Loan Commissioners to local authorities for purposes of the Housing Acts. Under the Housing Acts, the Council are empowered to borrow, with the sanction of the London County Council, for a period not exceeding 80 years; but hitherto the maximum period for which the Public Works Loan Commissioners could lend the money has been 50 years, and the longer the duration of the loan the greater was the rate of interest chargeable. 165 Section 3 will enable the Council to obtain loans from the Commissioners for any purposes of the Housing Acts for the full period sanctioned by the London County Council for repayment, if the Board make a recommendation to that effect, and whatever the period for repayment, the loan is to be made at the minimum rate allowed for the time being for loans out of the Local Loans Fund. This rate at the present time is 3½ per cent. Power of Hoard on complaint to enforce exercise of powers. Section 10, so far as it concerns metropolitan boroughs, confers upon the Board power, where a complaint is made to them by four inhabitant householders of the borough that the local authority have failed to exercise their powers under Part II. or Part III. of the principal Act in cases where those powers ought to have been exercised, to cause a public local inquiry to be held. If after holding such an inquiry the Board are satisfied that there has been such a failure on the part of the local authority, they are empowered to declare the authority to be in default, and to make an Order directing that authoritv, within a time limited by the Order, to carry out such works and do such other things as may be mentioned in the Order for the purpose of remedying the default (Sub-section (1) ). Contracts by landlord. Section 75 of the principal Act provided that in any contract made after the 14th August, 1885, for letting for habitation by persons of the working classes a house or part of a house, there was to be an implied condition that the house was at the commencement of the holding in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation, but this Section only applied where the rent did not exceed in London £20, in Liverpool £13, in Manchester or Birmingham £10, and elsewhere £8. Section 14 of the new Act makes this condition implied in any contract made after the passing of the Act for letting a house for habitation where the rent does not exceed, in the case of a house situate in the administrative countv of London, £40. But the condition above referred to is not to be implied when a house or part of a house is let for a term of not less than three years upon the terms that it be put by the lessee into a condition reasonably fit for occupation, and the lease is not determinable at the option of either party before the expiration of that term. Condition as to kteping houses in repair. Section 15 of the Act establishes a new and important principle in regard to contracts for letting houses to which Section 14 applies. The enactment is designed to secure that the houses shall, during the holding, be kept by the landlord in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation, and it provides machinery for remedying any default on the part of the landlord in this respect. Thus it provides that Section 14 shall, as respects contracts to which that Section applies, take effect as if the condition implied by it included an undertaking that the house shall, during the holding, be kept by the landlord in all respects fit for human habitation (Sub-section (1) ). 166 The landlord or the Council, or any person authorised by him or them in writing, may at reasonable times of the day enter any house, premises, or building to which the Section applies for the purpose of viewing its state and condition, on giving 24 hours notice to the tenant or occupier (Sub-section (2) )• Sub-section (3) makes it the duty of the Council, as the local authority within the meaning of Part II. of the principal Act, where it appears to them that the implied undertaking is not complied with in the case of any house to which it applies (if a closing order is not made with respect to the house), by written notice, to require the landlord within a reasonable time, being not less than 21 days, specified in the notice, to execute such works as the Council specify in the notice as being necessary to make the house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. The landlord is enabled within 21 days after the receipt of such notice, by written notice to the Council, to declare his intention of closing the house for human habitation, and thereupon a closing order is to be deemed to have become operative in respect of the house (Sub-section (4) ). But if the notice given by the Council is not complied with, and if the landlord has not given notice of his intention to close the house, the Council are authorised, at the expiration of the time specified in the notice given by them to the landlord, themselves to do the work required to be done and to recover the expenses incurred by them in so doing from the landlord as a civil debt, in manner provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The Council have, however, if they think fit, the alternative of declaring the expenses incurred by them to be payable by annual instalments within a period not exceeding that of the interest of the landlord in the house, nor in any case five years, with interest at a rate not exceeding £5 per cent, per annum, until the whole amount is paid and the instalments or interest or any part thereof will be recoverable summarily from the landlord as a civil debt (Sub-section (5) ). The landlord is given a right to appeal to the Board against any notice requiring him to execute works under the section, and against any demand for the recovery of expenses from him under it, or order made with respect to those expenses by the Council, by giving notice of appeal to the Board within 21 days after the notice is received or the demand or order is made. No proceedings are to be taken in respect of a notice requiring works, order, or demand whilst the appeal is pending (Sub section (6) ). For the purposes of this Section, the expression " landlord " is defined to mean any person who lets to a tenant for habitation the house under any contract referred to in the section, and includes his successors in title; and the expression "house" is defined as including part of a house (Sub-section (7) ). Extension of power of making of by-laws with respect to lodging-houses for the working classes. Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, empowers the Council to make by-laws for various matters with respect to houses or parts of houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. 167 By Section 16 of the new Act the power of making and enforcing such by-laws is extended, in the case of houses intended for the working classes, to by-laws imposing any duty, which may be imposed by the by-laws and which involves the execution of work, upon the owner within the meaning of the Act of 1891. The by-laws may impose the duty upon the owner in addition to or in substitution for any other person having an interest in the premises, and may prescribe the circumstances and conditions in and subject to which it is to be discharged (Sub-section (1) ). For the purpose of discharging any duty imposed by by-laws as abovementioned, the owner or other person is empowered at all reasonable times to enter upon any part of the premises, and Section 51 of the principal Act, which imposes a penalty for preventing the execution of the provisions of Part II. of that Act, is made applicable with the necessary modifications (Sub-section (2) ). It is further provided that where an owner or other person has failed to execute any work which he has been required to execute under the by-laws, the Sanitary Authority may, after giving to him not less than 21 days' notice in writing, themselves execute the works and recover the costs and expenses. For that purpose Sub-section (5) of Section 15 of the new Act, with respect to the execution of works and the recovery of expenses by local authorities, is made applicable as if the owner or other person were the landlord, and with such other adaptations as may be necessary (Sub-section (3) ). Duty of local authority as to closing of dtcel/ing-house un fit for human habitation. Section 17, which supersedes Section 32 of the principal Act, deals with -closing orders. The opening words of Sub-section (1), which impose upon the local authority the duty of causing to be made from time to time inspection of their district with a view to ascertain whether any dwelling-house in it is in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, re-enact the existing law. The further duty imposed by the Sub-section upon the local authority and every officer of the local authority to comply with such regulations and to keep such records as may be prescribed by the Local Government Board is new. Under Section 11 of the new Act the Board are empowered to make Orders requiring local authorities to remedy default as regards the inspection of their district required by Section 17. Under the principal Act closing orders were made by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. Under Section 17 (2) of the new Act they will be made by the local authority; Sub-section (3) gives an owner aggrieved by a closing order a right of appeal to the Local Government Board within 14 days after the order is served upt n him. A definition of the term " owner," for the purposes of this and other Sections, which pursuant to Section 47 of the new Act are deemed to be part of Part II. of the principal Act, will be found in Section 49 (2). The new Act does not in any way prescribe the procedure to be adopted by the local authority before making a closing order This matter is left to their discretion. 168 A closing order will not bccome operative so as to be put into actual force until either the time within which an appeal can be made has elapsed without an appeal being made, or, in case an appeal is made, the appeal is determined or abandoned, and no proceedings under the order are to be taken till it becomes operative; Section 39 (2). The time within which, when a closing order has become operative, an occupying tenant with his family can be required to cease to inhabit the house in respect of which the order has been made is increased by Section 17 (4) from 7 to 14 days after service of notice, and the tenant who makes default, instead of being subjected to a fine as heretofore, will be liable to have a summary order to quit made against him. The local authority may make to any tenant a reasonable allowance on account of his expenses in removing. The amount of the allowance will be primarily determinable by the local authority with the owner's consent, though in default of such consent it will be fixed by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. But an allowance for expenses of removal is not to be given if the house has been made unfit for habitation by the wilful act or default of the tenant or of some one for whom, as between himself and the owner or landlord, he is responsible; Sub-section (5). The local authority must, under Sub-section (6), determine a closing order made by them if they are satisfied that the dwelling-house has been rendered fit for human habitation, and the owner is given a right of appeal to the Board against a refusal on the part of the authority to do so. A Court of Summary Jurisdiction will no longer have power to enlarge the time for the execution of any works under a closing order ; Section 21. Special provisions are made by Sub-section (7) of Section 17 in regard to underground rooms habitually used as sleeping places which, unless they conform to certain conditions, are to be regarded as dwelling-houses unfit for human habitation, and as such liable to have closing orders made in regard to them. These provisions do not, however, came into operation until ist July, 1910, and a closing order made in respect of any room to which the Sub-section applies is not to be treated as a closing order in respect of a dwelling-house for the purposes of Section 18 of the Act which deals with demolition orders. The provisions of Sub-section (7) are as follows: — A room habitually used as a sleeping place,, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room, is, for the purposes of Section 17, to be deemed to be a dwelling-house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either— (a) is not on the average at least seven feet in height from floor to ceiling ; or (b) does not comply with such regulations as the Council, with the consent of the Board, may proscribe for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such rooms, and the protection of the rooms against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation. The Board are empowered, if the local authority, after being required to do so by the Board, fail to make such regulations as above mentioned, or such regulations as the Board approve, themselves to make regulations, and the regulations so made are to have effect as if they had been made by the local authority with the Board's consent. It is, however, provided that a closing order made in respect of a room to which the Sub-section applies is not to prevent the room being used for 169 purposes other than those of a sleeping place; and that if the occupier of the room after notice of an order has been served upon him. fails to comply with the order, an order to comply with it may, on summary conviction, be made against him. Order for demolition. Section 18, which supersedes.Section 33 of the principal Act, deals with the demolition of dwelling-houses which have been closed by closing orders. Under Sub section (1) proceedings with a view to an order for the demolition of a dwelling-house cannot be initiated untd a closing order has been operative for three months, and wnen that period has elapsed the local authority must, before making a demolition order, give the owner an opportunity of being heard on the matter at a meeting of which he has had at least one month's notice. Sub-section (2) indicates the circumstances in which a demolition order must be made, and this must now be done if the local authority are of opinion that the dwelling-house has not been rendered fit for human habitation, and that the necessary steps are not being taken with all due diligence to render it so fit, or that the continuance of any building which is, or is part of, the house is a nuisance, or is dangerous or injurious to the health of the public or of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwelling-houses. Where, however, the case is one in which the local authority consider that the dwelling-house can be made fit for human habitation, they can, under Sub-section (3), give the owner an opportunity to render it so fit. if he undertakes to execute the necessary work, by postponing the operation of the order for a period not exceeding six months. No enlargement of the time allowed for the execution of works or the demolition of a building can now be granted by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction (Section 21). Sub-section (4) gives to the owner of a building in regard to which a demolition order has been made a right of appeal to the Board. Mode in which contributions by London Borough Councils to the County Council, or rice versa, may be made. Under Section 46 of the principal Act, as amended by Section 14 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903, certain payments or contributionsmay be made or ordered to be made by a Metropolitan Borough Council towards the expenses of the London County Council, under Part II. of the principal Act or by the London County Council, towards the expenses of a Metropolitan Borough Council under that Part. Section 33 of the new Act makes it clear that any such payment or contribution may be made either by means of the payment of a lump sum or by means of an annual payment of such amount and for such number of years as may be agreed upon or ordered. Prohibition of back-to-back houses. Section 43 prohibits for the future the erection of any back-to-back houses intended to be used as working class dwellings, and declares that any such house commenced to be erected after the 3rd December, 1909, is to be deemed to be unfit for human habitation for the purposes of the Housing Acts. The Section is to take effect notwithstanding anything in any local Act or by-law in force in any borough or district, but it contains a saving in respect of:— 170 (1) The erection or use of a house containing several tenements in which the tenements are placed back.to.back, if the Medical Officer of Health for the district certifies that the several tenements are constructed and arranged so as to secure effective ventilation of all habitable rooms in every tenement; and (2) Houses abutting on any streets the plans of which have been approved by the local authority before the 1st May, 1909, in any borough or district where on the 3rd of December, 1909, any local Act or by.laws were in force permitting the erection of back.to.back houses. Amendment of definitions for purposes of Part II. of the principal Act. Under Section 49 (1) of the new Act the definition of the term "dwelling house" in Section 29 of the principal Act is amended by the omission of the words "means any inhabited building and." Consequently a house would not cease to be a dwelling house within the definition because it ceased to be inhabited. Again, the term "owner" is enlarged by Section 49 (2) so as to include, in addition to the definition given by the Lands Clauses Acts, all lessees or mortgagees of any premises required to be dealt with under Part I. of the new Act, except persons holding or entitled to the rents and profits of the premises under a lease of which the original term is less than 21 years. § 2—LOCAL ACTS.

EXTRACT FROM ANNUAL REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SOUTH WARE FOR 1909. Griffiths v. Weathbritt (Southwark Borough Council). Provision of a water supply to the upper storeys of a house under Section 78. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1997. Re 18, Olney Street. A summons in this case was issued at the express instructions of the Public Health Committee after some of the members had visited the premises. The proceedings before the magistrate on the 17th December, 1909, were taken under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Section 78 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, to require provision of a proper and sufficient water supply to the upper floor of 18, Olney Street. The premises are technically a tenemented house, occupied by two separate families, the family without a supply of water being on the top floor. There are three storeys, the lowest one being a half.basement. The existing water supply is from two taps, one in the yard and the other in a washhouse in the yard. At the hearing at the Lambeth Police Court the magistrate (Mr. Chapman) made an order on the owner, who duly appeared, to provide the supply of water as asked for. The owner immediately appealed to the Quarter Sessions. At the hearing at the Sessions, on January 7th, 1910, the Bench unanimously dismissed the appeal, and upheld the magistrate's order, with costs. Evidence was given, on behalf of the Borough Council, by Dr. Hamer, one of the London County Council's medical officers, and Dr. Millson, Medical Officer of Health for Southwark, to the effect that the occupants of the top floor rooms had to come down twenty.five steps to fetch up their water, and it then had to be stored in a bucket in the room in which persons lived and slept. On examination the water was found to be polluted by bird manure, seeds and other substances. Owing to the difficulty of carrying up the water it was found that the family used only three bucketfuls a day for all purposes, when they should have used at least eighteen bucketfuls, which is the acknowledged quantity required for such a family. It was contended, therefore, that the supply of water, owing to the difficulty of carrying it upstairs, was so restricted as to be insufficient for the maintenance of the health of the family. Mr. Campion appeared for the Appellant and Mr. Frank Dodd for the Borough Council. 182 PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) ORDER AND REGULATIONS, 1908. Certain difficulties having arisen under this Order and Regulations quoted in the Annual Report for 1908, Part VI. Legislation, § 3, Orders, it is desirable that the following decisions of the Local Government Board should be known and placed on record:— (1) Notification without definite address. A certificate was received by the Medical Officer of Health from the Master of a Union Workhouse stating that a patient who was suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis was taking his discharge on a particular date and proceeding to " Paddington," no definite address being given. The Local Government Board in a letter (22673M/1909), dated 19th March, 1909, expressed the opinion "that a notification in the form of that of which a copy was enclosed does not entitle the notifyee to a fee. (2) Repeating notifications. A Poor Law Medical Officer submitted the following questions as to repeating notifications:— (a) If a patient certified (outside an institution) as having pulmonary tuberculosis goes to the Infirmary or Workhouse for any period—no matter how short — and on leaving same goes again under the care of a Poor Law District Medical Officer, should latter re.certify the case ? (b) Where the term is fixed to Order for medical out.relief and renewed on expiration of the said term, should a Poor Law Medical Officer re.certify on renewal of Order ? The Local Government Board advised (92938M/1909) under the date 5th August, 1909— (a) The Poor Law Medical Officer should re.certify the case, and (b) the Poor Law Medical Officer should not do so. (3) Compulsory detention of paupers suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Provision is made by Section 22 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1867 30 and 31 Victoria Ch. 106), for the detention in the Workhouse of inmates suffering from bodily disease of an infectious or contagious character. In 1905, in reply to an inquiry addressed to them on the subject the Local Government Board stated that if advanced phthisis from which a workhouse inmate is suffering is pulmonary tuberculosis with expectoration they thought it might be regarded as an infectious disease within the meaning of the Section.
