April, 1909. To the Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith, in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1908. The mortality statistics for the year are again of a very satisfactory character, T'he Birth Rate of 23.36 per 1,000 is slightly below that of the County of London, which figure was 25.2 per 1,000. The recorded Death Rate of 12.42 per 1,000 of the estimated population, compares favourably with 13.8 per 1,000, the Death Rate for the County of London, and with 14.9 per 1,000, the figure for the 76 large towns. Comparing Greenwich with the other Metropolitan Boroughs according to their corrected Death Rate, which is the fairest method of comparison, shows that Greenwich has the lowest Death Rate but 4 amongst the 29 Metropolitan Boroughs. The 4 Boroughs having a better Death Rate than Greenwich being Hampstead, Lewisham, Woolwich, and Wandsworth. Full particulars of all the Boroughs, in this respect, are to be found in the table on page 16. The Infantile Mortality Rate, for the Borough, measured by the number of deaths under one year to 1,000 births registered, was 120, an increase of 17 compared with last year ; the figure for 10 London as a whole was 116, and the Borough average during the last five years, 1903-1907, inclusive, 123. The Zymotic Death Rate of 1.16 per 1,000 is .19 per 1,000 below the County average, viz., 1.35 per 1,000, and is 0.23 per 1,000 below the corresponding figure for last year. The figures relating to the different constituent parts of the Borough are as follows Districts. Birth Rate. Death Rate. Percentage of deaths under one year of age. Infantile Mortality per 1.600 Births. Zymotic Death Rate. Diarrhoea ConDeath sumption Rate. Death Rate.

I think the fact that never since the Borough was formed has his attendance at Police Court in a case of adulteration under the Food and Drugs Acts been required either by the prosecution or defence in connection with any of the certificates of analysis 11 emanating from him shows that his analyses were generally accepted as being beyond dispute. In conclusion, I have again to tender my best thanks to each and all Members of the Council, and the Public Health Committee in particular, for their continued kindness and support, and also to the Members of the Staff for the manner in which their duties have been performed. I am, Gentlemen, Yours respectfully, ERNEST G. ANNIS. VITAL AND MORTAL STATISTICS, 1908. POPULATION. The number of persons estimated to be living at the middle of the year is 109,110. This estimate is an increase of 1,888 upon the corresponding figure of last year. The natural increase of the population during the year, or the excess of the number of births over the number of deaths, is 1,213, which therefore allows 675 as the balance of immigrants over emigrants. The distribution of the population throughout the Borough is as follows :— Census, 1901. Estimated Population at middle of year 1908. East Greenwich 43,859 49,970 West Greenwich 23,456 26,722 St. Nicholas 7,321 8,340 Charlton 18,065 20,572 Kidbrooke 3,069 3,506 Total 95,770 109,110 12 MARRIAGES. The Superintendent-Registrar of the Greenwich Union has kindly furnished me with the particulars relating to the number of marriages solemnized in the Parishes of Greenwich and St. Nicholas. The Superintendent-Registrar for the Woolwich Union has also kindly supplied the particulars for the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrooke, with the exception, in these latter particulars, that none of the marriages performed in the Woolwich Registrar's Office and in Chapels in Charlton and Kidbrooke, of residents in those Parishes, are included. The following table shews these particulars, giving the number of Marriages in Greenwich and St. Nicholas, &c., for each year since 1893. Year.

The total number of births registered in the Borough during the year has been 2,629, but of these 43 occurred in the Greenwich Union Infirmary, and 1 in Seamen's Hospital, the address of the mother being in 40 cases in Deptford, 1 in Stoke Newington, 1 in Poplar, 1 in Bromley, and 1 in Lewisham; 13 deducting these and adding five which were transferred from Lambeth, Stepney, and Marylebone, it will be seen that the number of strictly Greenwich births for 1908 is 2,590, of which 1,324 were males, and 1,266 females. This corrected figure gives a birth rate of 23.36 per 1,000 of the population, being the lowest on record, and 3.33 below the average for the last seven years, 1901 to 1907, the period since the formation of the Metropolitan Borough. Amongst the total number of births registered in the Borough there were 91 in which the name of the father was not registered and therefore not given in the return; accordingly these births may be presumed to be of an illegitimate character, 54 of such births were registered in the East Greenwich district, which includes the Infirmary of the Greenwich Union. In 25 cases the mother was ordinarily a resident in the Borough of Deptford, and accordingly this number of births have been transferred to that Borough, in one case the mother ordinarily resided in the Borough of Bromley and that birth similarly has been transferred to Bromley. The remaining 65 were similarly allocated to the districts in this Borough in which the mother ordinarily resided, making 28 of such births belonging to East Greenwich, 19 to West Greenwich, 9 to St. Nicholas, and 9 to Charlton. The birth rate for the County of London equals 25.2 per 1,000 of the population, and was the lowest rate recorded. It varied from 14.9 in the City of London and Hampstead, 16.7 in the City of Westminster, 19.6 in Holborn, and 19.7 in Stoke Newington, up to 31.1 in Finsbury, 31.5 in Poplar, 32.0 in Shoreditch, 32.1 in Stepney, 32.5 in Bermondsey, and 32.6 in Bethnal Green. Towards the end of the year the question of the adoption of the Notification of Births Act was again considered at some 14 length, and eventually in the early part of this year (1909), it was resolved to adopt the Act. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered during 1908 was 1,377, of which 720 were males, and 657 females. The crude death rate for the Borough of 12.42 per 1,000, compares favourably with 13.8, the death rate for the County of London, and 14.7 the death rate for the 76 large towns. In the County of London the lowest crude death rates amongst the various Metropolitan Boroughs were 8.5 in Hampstead, 11.0 in Lewisham, 11.4 in Woolwich, 11.6 in Wandsworth, 12.2 in Battersea, 12.3 in Stoke Newington, 12.4 in Paddington, Fulham, and Greenwich, and 12.6 in City of Westminster; while the highest rates were 17.1 in Bethnal Green, 17.4 in Shoreditch, 17.7 in City of London, 18.6 in Finsbury, and 18.8 in Bermondsey. Locally, the death rate varied from 3.93 in Kidbrooke, 11.96 in Charlton, 12.05 in East Greenwich, and 13.37 in West Greenwich, to 16.53 in St. Nicholas. The following table shows the variation in, and average of, the death rates in each of the five Districts of the Borough in the five years 1903 to 1907, compared with the figures for 1908 :— District. 1903. 1904. 1905. 1900. 1907.

The Infantile Mortality, recorded by the deaths of children under one year of age to the number of births registered, was 120 per 1,000 births, there having been a total of 310 such deaths during the year, as compared with 259, 320 and 318, the figures for the three preceding years. The number for the County of London was 113 per 1,000 births. The lowest rates of Infantile Mortality amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs were 69 per 1,000 births in Hampstead, 86 in Lewisham, 92 in the City of London and Stoke Newington, and 94 in Woolwich; whilst the highest were 130 in Stepney, 131 in Southwark, 132 in Bethnal Green, 133 in Finsbury, 139 in Shoreditch, and 144 in Bermondsey. Locally, the variations were from 111 per 1,000 births in East and West Greenwich, 130 in St. Nicholas, 133 in Kibrooke, and 154 in Charlton; the following table compares, at a glance, these figures for the years since the formation of the Borough:— District. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906.

Small-Pox. There were no deaths from this disease in 1908, this being the sixth year since a death occurred from this cause in the Borough. Measles. Sixteen deaths were ascribed as due to this disease, two only of the patients being over five years of age; this number is a large decrease from the 55 which occurred in 1907; 29, 18 and 40 deaths were recorded in the three preceding years. Nine of the deaths occurred in West Greenwich, 4 in St. Nicholas, and 3 in Charlton. The quarterly incidence was nil in the first, and 7, 2 and 7 respectively in the succeeding quarters. 21 Scarlet Fever. This disease occasioned 6 deaths, 3 being under and 3 over five years of age; there were 2 in East Greenwich, 2 in West Greenwich, and 2 in Charlton. Ten such deaths occurred in 1907 and 17 in 1906. Diphtheria. There were 18 deaths from this disease during 1908. This gives a death rate for Diphtheria of 0.16, comparing with 0.19, the rate for 1907. Twenty deaths occurred in 1907, which were attributed to this cause, and 30, 15 and 12 in the three preceding years. Twelve of the patients were under five years of age, 9 of them dying in the Brook Hospital, 1 in the Greenwich Union Infirmary, and 1 in the Seamen's Hospital; the one remaining being under treatment at home; 6 of the patients were over five years of age, and of these 3 died in the Brook Hospital, and the remaining 3 in their own homes. There was a further number of 42 deaths from Diphtheria in patients not ordinarily resident in this Borough, but under treatment at the Brook Hospital, and 1 in the Miller Hospital. Twelve tubes of Diphtheria Anti-toxin, containing a total of 48,000 units of serum, for the treatment of patients suffering from this disease, have been supplied by this Council during the year. Whooping Cough. This disease was given as the cause of 31 deaths in 1907, as against 26, 41 and 14 in the three preceding years. These deaths equal a rate of 0.28 per 1,000. There was only one patient over five years of age. Twenty-three of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 4 in West Greenwich, 2 in St. Nicholas, and 2 in Charlton. 22 Typhoid Fever. There were nine deaths ascribed as due to this disease; there were 5 each in 1907, 1906, and 1905, 8 in 1904, and 1 in 1903.

The deaths were distributed as follows :—17 in East Greenwich, 10 in West Greenwich, 5 in St. Nicholas, and 17 in Charlton. One patient only was over five years of age, this exception being over 65. Influenza. Influenza is found to have been the responsible cause in 34 deaths in 1908; 18 was the average of the previous three years. Of the 34, 15 were over sixty-five years of age. Sporadic. Tetanus. There was one death only from this disease during the year, in Charlton. Venereal. Syphilis. Four deaths were given as due to Syphilis, as against 9 in 1907 and 4 in 1906. Of these 4 deaths, 2 were children under five years of age. Two occurred in East Greenwich, and two in West Greenwich. One of the deceased persons was in the Greenwich Union Infirmary, and one died in an Institution situated outside the district. There were no deaths from Gonorrhoea during the year. 23 Septic.

This disease was the cause of 6 deaths in 1908, as compared with 6 in 1904, and three in each of the two preceding years. Rheumatism of the heart was given as the cause of 1 death. Tuberculosis. This class includes the causes of 171 deaths during the year under review, with a rate of 1.54; these figures compare with 143, 161 and 185, the totals of the previous three years, and respective rates of 1.34, 1.53, and 1.79. Tuberculosis of Lungs (Consumption) is, as usual, credited with the major portion of these deaths, there being 126 attributed to this cause, or a rate of 1.14 per 1,000, comparing with 1.32 per 1,000, the phthisis death rate for the whole of London. Amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs this death rate ranged from 0.78 in Hampstead, 0.85 in Lewisham, 0.96 in Wandsworth, 0.98 in Kensington, 1.01 in Paddington, up to 1.88 in Southwark, l.89 in Bermondsey, 2.00 in Shoreditch, 2.11 in Holbom, and 2.15 in Finsbury. 24 Locally, the deaths were 2 in Kidbrooke, giving a death rate of 0.56; 17 in St. Nicholas, giving a death rate of 2.01; 19 in Charlton, giving a death rate of 0.91; 26 in West Greenwich, giving a death rate of 0.96; and 62 in East Greenwich, giving a death rate of 1.22 per 1.000.

The voluntary notification of cases of Consumption continues in force in the Borough and is, as the figures show, still appreciated by medical men in the district. 107 such notifications have been received and dealt with during the year, the numbers in preceding years having been 107, 112, 109. Thirty-nine of these notifications were in East Greenwich, 34 in West Greenwich, 24 in St. Nicholas, and 10 in Charlton. These are dealt with in more detail on page 43. Parasitic Diseases. There was 1 death from this class of disease, giving a rate of 0.01 from Actinomycosis. Dietic Diseases. There was 1 death from this class of disease, giving a rate of 0.01 from chronic alcoholism. Constitutional Diseases. The deaths from this cause were 111 in number, which gives a rate of 1.00 per 1000. Of these 89 were attributed to Cancer, 9 to Diabetes, 7 to Anæmia, 3 to Osteo-arthritis, 2 from Gout, and 1 from Lymphaderoma. The deaths from Cancer were distributed as follows ; 43 occurred This Diagram gives in comparative from the Death from those Diseases which have caused the principal amount of Mortality during 1908. 25 in East Greenwich, 22 in West Greenwich, 4 in St. Nicholas, 19 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Developmental Diseases. There were 250 deaths from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 2.26 per 1,000. These may roughly be divided into those from causes which would appear to be unavoidable, viz.:—Atelectasis 6, Congenital defects 8, and those from causes more or less preventible, viz.:— Premature birth 49, Injury at birth 0, Debility at birth 9, Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus 35, Dentition 5, and Rickets 4. The remaining and largest portion of these deaths from developmental diseases, 134 in number, were from Old Age; in 1907 there were 139 deaths from this cause, and 158 in the previous year. Local Diseases. Nervous System. One hundred and twenty-three deaths were attributed to the various nervous diseases, which gives a rate of 1.11 per 1,000; last year the rate was 1.00 per 1,000. Convulsions were responsible for 18, all being under 5 years of age; 10 were from Meningitis, 43 from Apoplexy, 8 from Softening of the Brain, 9 from Hemiplegia or Brain Paralysis, 8 from General Paralysis of the Insane, 6 from other forms of Insanity, 2 from Cerebral Tumour, 6 from Epilepsy, 3 from Locomotor Ataxy, 7 from Paraplegia, and 3 from the other diseases of this system. Organs of Special Sense. One death was given as being due to this class of disease. Circulatory System. The death rate from diseases of this system were equal to a rate of 1.08 per 1,000, there being a 26 total of 120 such deaths. Valvular diseases of the heart were responsible for 101; 5 each from Aneurism and Embolism, 3 from Phlebitis, and from the remaining diseases of this system, 6. Respiratory System. Two hundred and one deaths were due to diseases of the respiratory organs, as compared with 234 in the preceding year. The death rate under this heading equals 1.81 per 1,000. 39 were from acute and 49 from Chronic Bronchitis; 97 from the various forms of Pneumonia, 51 being under 5 years of age; 4 were from Laryngitis, 5 each from Asthma and Pleurisy, and 2 from the other diseases of the respiratory system. Digestive System. There were 104 deaths from diseases of this system, equal to a rate of 0.94 per 1,000. Enteritis was responsible for 37, 32 being under 5 years of age; 7 were due to diseases of the stomach, 9 to Ulcer of stomach and duodenum, 3 to Appendicitis, 25 to obstruction or other diseases of the intestine, 10 to Cirrhosis and 4 to other diseases of the liver, 6 to Peritonitis, and 3 to the other diseases of the digestive system. Lymphatic System. There was one death from diseases affecting this system. Urinary System.—Thirty-eight deaths, equal to a rate of 0.34 per 1000, occurred from diseases affecting this system, 23 were from Bright's Disease, 5 from Acute Nephritis, 7 from diseases of the Bladder and Prostate, and 3 to other diseases of urinary system. Reproductive System. Diseases of the generative organs were the cause of two deaths, and a similar number are ascribed to diseases of Parturition. Bones and Joints. There were two deaths from diseases of bones and joints. 27 External Causes. There were 65 deaths given as due to causes grouped under this heading; 56 were the result of accident or negligence, and the remaining 9 were from Suicide. Suffocation, by being overlaid in bed, was the cause of death of 7 children under five years of age; 10 cases were from drowning, while accidents on railways, in vehicular traffic and in building operations and falls were responsible for 39 deaths. The Suicides were by hanging in 4 cases, drowning 2, and 1 each to cut or stab, asphyxia, and precipitation from elevated places. No death has been left so insufficiently described as to need classification under the ill-defined causes heading, and this is a most satisfactory feature. MORTUARY.

Two hundred and twenty-one cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, as compared with 253, 397, 144 and 150, respectively, in the four previous years. The distribution of these cases was as follows:—134 in East Greenwich, 45 in West Greenwich, 14 in St. Nicholas, 19 in Charlton, and 9 in Kidbrooke. Of this total number 200 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. There were 18 fatalities due to this disease, which gives a case mortality of 8.1 per cent. One thousand two hundred and eighty-five specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from cases suspected to be Diphtheria. Of this number, 1,089 were reported to give negative or doubtful results, and 196 were positive in character, being dealt with accordingly. The quarterly incidence of the disease for 1908 has been as follows :— 1st Quarter—East Greenwich, 50 cases; West Greenwich, 12; St. Nicholas, 1; Charlton, 7; Kidbrooke, 6; a total of 76 cases. 2 nd Quarter—East Greenwich, 31 cases; West Greenwich, 5; Charlton, 2; a total of 38 cases. 3rd Quarter—East Greenwich, 16 cases; West Greenwich, 13; St. Nicholas, 6; Charlton, 3; Kidbrooke, 1; a total of 39 cases. 4th Quarter—East Greenwich, 37 cases; West Greenwich, 15; St. Nicholas, 7; Charlton, 7; Kidbrooke, 2; a total of 68 cases. 32 During the past year the active measures adopted to combat this disease have been continued, and the following cases will explain in a measure how the disease is spread:— N. S., 168, V. Road, was discharged from the Hospital on February 22nd, after suffering from an attack of Diphtheria, and on being examined bacteriologically some few days afterwards was found to give a positive result. This information was conveyed to the parents with a request that they should call in their usual medical attendant and to keep the patient isolated. This isolation was carried out for some time, and frequent bacteriological examinations from swabbings from the throat were made giving positive results, in fact so long that the parties concerned as well as the Medical Attendant began to look with suspicion upon the report of the bacteriologist, as no clinical symptoms manifested themselves throughout the whole of this period, and a negative report was not obtained until the 3rd April. In the meantime, on March 8th, the brother had developed Diphtheria and had been removed to Hospital for treatment. C. B., 52, L. Road, after having suffered from both Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria in the Hospital, was discharged on March 7th. His sister began to be ill on the day after his discharge developing Scarlet fever. She was removed to the Hospjtal on the 10th March, and on the other members of the family being examined on the 11th, Charles was still found to have the diphtheria organisms present in his throat. He was again removed to the Hospital, not being discharged until the 14th May, when a bacteriological examination gave a negative result. W. H., 31, L. Road, was notified to be suffering from Diphtheria, and was removed to the Hospital on March 31st. On the 33 Medical Officer of Health calling to examine the other children with a view to their returning to school, the bacteriological examination of a swab from the throat of G. B. gave a positive result. This information was forwarded to the parents on April 4th, requesting them to call in their usual medical attendant and isolate the patient. There were at this time no clinical symptoms; this intimation was duly received by the parents on April 5th. On our making further enquiries on April 6th as to whether a medical man had been called in or no it was found that no one was in attendance but that the Parish Doctor was to be called in the next day. A notification was duly received, and the patient removed to Hospital on the 10th April. D. J. W., aged 4 years, 37, O. W. Road, was notified as suffering from Diphtheria and removed to the Hospital on May 11th; on making enquiry as to the source of infection in this case the patient's mother stated that D. J. W. had apparently been ill for some weeks, and that on the evening of April 5th, Mrs. B., of 31, L. Road, called to see her having with her the above-mentioned child G. B. The two children, G. B. and D. J. W. played together, and in the course of conversation Mrs. B. is stated to have said that she had received a note from the Medical Officer of Health saying that G. B. had diphtheria germs in her throat, and that it did not seem to affect her much by the way she was playing with D. G. W. F. B., 59, W. P. Road, was notified as suffering from Diphtheria on June 26th the patient being treated at home; it appears that this child complained of sore throat on Monday, May 22nd. The mother took the child to see a medical man, who told her that the throat was very suspicious of, diphtheria, 34 and that she had better keep the child isolated until he could tell her definitely. The medical man at the same time took a swab from the throat and sent it up for bacteriological examination. The next day as the child seemed better and did not want to miss her attendance at school as she was endeavouring to obtain a medal for attendance, the mother allowed her to go to school. On the following day a positive bacteriological report came to hand, and on the medical man calling again to see the patient it was found that she was then in attendance at school. Of course after this date, the child was isolated at home and notified in the ordinary way by the medical attendant. Unfortunately these one or two days attendance at school, however, appeared to give rise to a numerous series of sore throats, 49 such cases being notified to this Department by the School Authority two of which were found to be actually of a diphtheritic character. Amongst these 49 cases was one D. L., who continued to suffer from sore throat but always with a negative bacteriological result until October 10th, when the diphtheria organisms was definitely found to be present, and she was accordingly notified and removed to the Hospital. There were eight sore throat cases notified from the same C. P. School during September, and 32 in October, five of which were definitely found to have the diphtheria organisms present, and after the elimination of these cases from school attendance by their removal to Hospital or other treatment at home, the number of sore throat cases intimated from the school fell to four in November and three in December, only one of which proved to be positively of a diphtheritic character. M. W., 5, W. P. Road, was notified as suffering from diphtheria on October 22nd. This patient had been under 35 observation frequently, some times shewing the presence of a few diphtheria organisms, and at other times whilst suffering from sore throat, yet the definite bacteriological evidence of diphtheria was not forthcoming. After the removal of the patient to the Hospital, however, all the members of the family were again examined when it was found that J. W., although apparently quite well in health was suffering from a sore on his foot. The mother stated that he had had this sore for a long time, in fact months, and although she had been treating it with ointment, fomentations, &c., under the direction of medical men and in other ways according to the advice given to her by neighbours and friends, yet the sore on the foot showed no signs of improvement. On my closely examining the sore it appeared to me undoubtedly to have a diphtheroid appearance. I accordingly took a swab from the sore and submitted that to bacteriological examination, this giving a profuse positive diphtheritic growth, and this patient J. W., was accordingly notified and removed to the Hospital, after which date no further either definite cases of diphtheria or the very troublesome sore throat illnesses which had been prevalent occurred amongst the people in this house which included a large number of children. During the latter part of the year an outbreak occurred in connection with the boys in the Royal Hospital School; it occasioned great anxiety at the time. Although these premises being Government buildings are not amenable in the ordinary way to the requirements of the Sanitary Authority, and accordingly the cases of infectious disease occurring therein are not notified and included in the above returns, yet by the courtesy of the Medical Authorities at the School we are kept 36 regularly posted as to what goes on in the School, and, in fact, frequent consultations are held upon the subject. There were 27 cases definitely removed to the Hospital for treatment, others of a suspicious character were kept isolated and under observation for varying periods of time, but the outbreak definitely came to an end in the early part of December. Twelve cases which were notified as Diphtheria and removed to the Hospital, were returned after varying periods of observation as not suffering from this disease ; three were stated to be suffering from Tonsilitis and one Vincent's Angina. Erysipelas. One hundred cases were notified during the year, 20 being in East Greenwich, 36 in West Greenwich, 32 in St. Nicholas, 11 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Eight of these patients were removed to Public Institutions in the District. Scarlet Fever. Four hundred and twenty-three cases were notified during the year, as compared with 660, 566 and 288 cases, respectively, in the three preceding years; 190 cases were in East Greenwich, 112 in West Greenwich, 38 in St. Nicholas, 64 in Charlton, and 19 in Kidbrooke; 380 of these cases were removed to the Hospital for treatment. There were 6 deaths from this disease during the year, as against 10 last year. Twenty-two of the cases removed to the Hospital as suffering from Scarlet Fever were returned as wrongly diagnosed, and 5 stated to be Tonsilitis, I Febricula, and 1 Erythemia, no alternative disease, however, being stated in the remainder of the cases; while 7 patients on discharge were still suffering, 2 each from Rhinorrhcea, Chronic Nasal Discharge, and Otorrhcea, and 1 from Chronic Ear Discharge, and parents were duly notified of this. The following 'Table gives particulars of the eight cases, which would seem to be "return cases." There were five such cases in 1907, four in 1906, and twelve in 1905.

There were 34 cases of Typhoid Fever notified during the year, 18 being in East Greenwich, 5 in West Greenwich, 7 in St. Nicholas, 2 in Charlton, and 2 in Kidbrooke. The ages of the patients were : 6 between one and five years. 14 between five and fifteen years, 3 between fifteen and twenty-five years, and 11 between twenty-five and sixty-five years. Of the total number of cases, 28 were removed to the hospital for treatment. Eighteen such cases occurred in 1907, 41 in 1906; the average number for the years 1901 to 1907 inclusive, being 45. There were 9 fatalities from this disease during the year, 7 belonging to East Greenwich, 1 to West Greenwich, and 1 to St. Nicholas. Twenty specimens were forwarded for bacteriological examination from cases suspected to be Typhoid Fever in character, and of this number 11 gave a negative result, and 9 were positive in character. During the course of our investigations as to the origin of some of these cases of Typhoid Fever and other suspicious illnesses of a like character, we found that some of the patients had been eating mussels which they themselves had collected from certain old ships which were brought to one of the shipbreaking yards in the Borough for breaking-up purposes, and as there seemed to be presumptive evidence that this was the origin of certain of the cases, samples of the mussels were taken and submitted to bacteriological examination, when although the definite typhoid bacillus was not recognised by the ordinary methods of culture and isolation, there were found to be between (1) 100,000 and 1,000,000 colon bacilli per average mussel; (2) between 1,000 and 10,000 of Bacillus Enteritidis sporogenes per average 39 mussel; and (3) over 10,000 Streptococci per average mussel; these of course indicating a high degree of pollution, and such mussels would be certainly very likely to set up diarrhceal conditions. Correspondence ensued between this Department and the shipbreaking firm referred to, when the firm definitely gave an undertaking that in future they would see that immediately any vessel was brought to their yard for breaking-up purposes that the shell fish adhering to the sides and bottom should be thoroughly scraped off and destroyed, to ensure that in future no persons should be able to make any other use of any such polluted shell fish. We are not aware, and in fact do not think it probable, that any of the shell fish were sold, but were simply gathered by the individual consumers. Three cases which were notified and removed to the hospital, presumably suffering from this disease, were considered by the authorities in charge there not to be suffering from such disease, two being diagnosed as suffering from Epidemic Diarrhœa, and in one the illness was not stated. Recent investigations seem to prove beyond question that some few persons who have suffered from an attack of Typhoid Fever may continue to be carriers and distributors of the germ either continuously or intermittently for long periods of time, and the Local Government Board are now endeavouring to obtain more definite information on this point, having enlisted the assistance of the Medical Superintendents of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Medical Officers of Health of the various London Boroughs, so that in future certain persons who are discharged from the Hospital after suffering from Typhoid Fever will be kept under the supervision of the respective Sanitary Authorities for varying periods of time, bacteriological examinations being made for the discovery of the Typhoid germ at varying intervals, by which means it is hoped that some definite information will be obtained on this point. 40 Fish and Enteric Fever.

Two cases of this disease were notified during the year, one each in East and West Greenwich; there were 6 in 1909 and 2 in 1907. Both of the cases were treated in hospital. There were no deaths from this disease during the year. Chicken Pox. There are no full statistics obtainable as to the incidence of this disease, it not being now notifiable. Measles. Four hundred and ninety-seven cases of Measles were notified to this department by parents, guardians, school teachers, and others during the year. In each case visits were paid to the infected premises, and the usual measures of disinfection generally carried out. In the previous years, 1907, 1906 and 1905, they were respectively 1,245, 482, and 708. The fatalities from this disease for the present year were 16; in the preceding years, 55, 29, and 18 deaths respectively occurred. The following Tables show the occurrence of this disease as to quarterly, district, and age incidcnce:— 42 Table shewing number of Measles Cases reported during the year 1908. 1st QUARTER.

This shelter was used on 1 occasion during the year for the usual period to accommodate persons displaced for purposes of disinfection. Contacts. Intimation was received from the Medical Officers of Health to the various Port Sanitary Authorities on 14 occasions during the year in this connection, on seven occasions with respect to persons coming to an address in this district from a vessel from Russia where cases of cholera had developed, and on seven occasions from vessels which had had a small-pox case on board. Each of these persons was kept under observation. Glanders. Under the recent order making Glanders in Horses notifiable to the Local Authority there have been during the year seven different outbreaks notified. Enquiries have been made in each case, but no human Glanders has appeared to result therefrom. Consumption. During the year there were 107 cases of Consumption voluntarily notified, 39 being in East Greenwich, 34 in West Greenwich, 24 in St. Nicholas, and 10 in Charlton. Of this number 21 cases were under treatment in an Institution. The ages of the patients were, 1 under I year of age, 2 between 1 and 5 years, 13 between 5 and 15 years, 1G between 15 and 25 years, 70 between 25 and 65 years, and 5 over 65 years. Thirty-one specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from patients suspected to be consumptive; 24 were reported to be negative, and 7 positive. Disinfection has been offered and carried out in 77 cases, including 84 rooms and 89 articles of bedding, &c.; disinfectant has also been supplied to patients to disinfect sputum, &c. 44 GREENWICH HEALTH SOCIETY. During the year a considerable step forward has been taken in the neighbourhood by the formation of a local Health Society. The inaugural meeting was held in May, his Worship the Mayor taking the chair, and a number of ladies kindly volunteered to visit in selected districts. Several meetings of workers and others interested have been held during the year, when addresses have been given to the workers by various medical men in the Borough and others from the outside who are interested in such work. Up to the present no single complaint has been made in reference to the visits of these ladies, nor are we aware of any instances where such visit has been resented. Certain of the workers have brought to my notice the awkward position in which they are placed by their being supplied with the name and address where a child has been born, and on their calling to advise and help the mother they have found that the child has died, in some cases the death having occurred several weeks earlier. The Visitors thought that such addresses ought not to have been supplied to them, however on my explaining the matter shewing that it frequently occurs that the registration of the fact of birth is not made in some instances until weeks after the death of the child made it rather difficult to obtain accuracy in this respect, and the ladies of the Health Society have definitely urged me to do all I could to obtain the adoption of the Notification of Births Act, which I am pleased to say has been recently accomplished. Objects. To foster among the body of the people a desire to secure the best possible health and sanitation for the Borough, and to 45 use such means as may from time to time seem best adapted towards that end, and at the present time more especially to give attention to the feeding, clothing, and environments of infants and young children, so that a foundation may be laid for building; up healthy, happy, and useful lives. Methods. 1. By arranging for popular lectures on health, sanitation, and the feeding and rearing of children for District Visitors and others interested in the work of the Society. 2. By the distribution of popular leaflets and pamphlets. 3. By utilizing the services of trained local workers and others in giving practical instruction and advice in matters of health and sanitation to the people in their homes. 4. By working in co-operation with the Public Health, Authority, medical men, and the charitable and social agencies of the Borough. 5. By discussing and promoting any measures for the improvement of the Public Health, as may from time to time appear advisable. Constitution. That the membership consist of the Medical Officer of Health, and members of Public Bodies dealing with matters affecting the health of the Borough, and all who are willing to attend lectures, subscribe to the funds, or take an active part in carrying out the objects of the Society. 46 That the office bearers consist of a President, not more than four Vice-Presidents, an Hon. Secretary and Hon. Treasurer, and an Executive Committee to be appointed at each Annual Meeting. That the Borough be divided into eight districts corresponding more or less closely to the eight parishes, and that for each of these a Superintending Visitor be appointed who shall, in virtue of that office, be a member of the Executive Committee. That Visitors be appointed for each district, and that it shall be the duty of the Hon. Secretary to obtain every week from the Medical Officer of Health a list of the children born in the Borough, and that the Hon. Secretary forward to each Superintending Visitor the names of those born in her district. Instructions to Visitors. That the work in each district be apportioned by the Superintending District Visitor, and that printed directions as to the feeding and clothing of infants and young children be left at the first visit. That visits be made not less frequently than once a month and oftener if required. That Visitors, taking advantage of the printed directions, advise the parents as to feeding, clothing, and general environment of children. That attention be given to sanitation, and that where there appears to be any glaring defect that can only be remedied by the Local Authority or the Landlord, the Visitor shall report this to the Hon. Secretary who shall, if it appear necessary, bring the matter before the Committee. While Visitors are strictly enjoined to abstain from all interference when the child is being medically attended, unless 47 at the request of the Medical Attendant, it shall at the same time be their duty, when it appears necessary, to urge the parent to seek medical advice or call in the District Nurse. The Visitor must, however, at no time and in no circumstances express a preference for any particular medical man or medical institution. The Society does not administer relief, but, as relief may be required, it shall be the duty of the Visitor to be well acquainted with the methods of the Poor Law, and the various charitable and social agencies.

The Table on pages 78 to 82, summarizes, as far as is possible, the Sanitary Work of the Department; from this it will be seen that a total of 15,453 houses and premises have been inspected or re-inspected during the year; 1,383 intimation notices have been served, and 352 statutory notices. With the exception of prosecutions in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, it was only found necessary to institute Police Court proceedings in one case, that being in connection with a nuisance from the emission of black smoke. In this case the defendants were fined 10s. with £2 2s. costs. There were altogether throughout the year 303 complaints entered in the Public Complaint Register of the Department; these were in each case carefully investigated, and any necessary action immediately taken, thus there are none of these matters left outstanding or unattended to. One of the most serious complaints received has reference to the large quantity of dust produced in a somewhat recently established business in this district. Large quantities of empty cement bags being brought to the premises on the River Bank for cleansing and repair prior to their being put into use again. An enormous amount of dust is produced and the workers and their clothing together with premises in the neighbourhood become literally covered with it. Many consultations have been held with the Proprietors of the business, the Factory Inspector, and the Officers of this Council. Extensive lavatories and bath accommodation have been provided for the use of the Staff, and elaborate machinery is being arranged by means of Fans and 51 Exhaust Flues to deal with this nuisance which certainly is one of a very grave character. Bakehouses. Two hundred and four inspections have been made of the various Bakehouses in the Borough, and 38 nuisances found therein have been abated as the result. Factories and Workshops. Three hundred and fifty-two inspections have been paid to these premises within the Borough during the year. There were 246 Workshop premises on the Register at the beginning of the year, 14 have been added during the year, and 18 have been taken off, leaving a total now on the Register of 242. This total number includes 21 laundries, 40 dressmakers, 8 fuel and firewood works, 5 cycle works, 7 milliners, and various others, including workplaces, such as 4 blacksmiths, 12 barge builders, 3 builders' yards, &c. Information has been sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories with respect to 9 new workshops and 4 instances of young persons or females being employed on premises where no abstract is displayed. One complaint has been received from H.M. Inspector, and also 3 intimations respecting new workshops. The inspections have revealed the presence of defects or insanitary conditions requiring the service of 108 written notices, 62 of these being in respect of workshops, including workshop laundries, 40 in respect of workplaces, and 6 in respect of factories, including factory laundries. The notices had reference to want of cleanliness generally in 103 cases, want of ventilation in 4 cases, want of drainage of floors in 13 cases, insufficient sanitary accommodation in 11 cases, unsuitable or defective sanitary accommodation 15 cases, and other nuisances 39 cases. These defects have all been attended to. 52 Outworkers' Registers. Seventy-five lists of Outworkers, containing 232 names and addresses, have been received during the year from Medical Officers of Health for other Districts; 25 lists, containing 167 names, have been received from employers within the District; 23 lists, containing 91 names, have been forwarded to other Districts, thus giving a total of 308 names and addresses of outworkers within the Borough. Two hundred and forty-five visits of inspection have been made to these premises, and insanitary conditions, mainly want of cleanliness, have been revealed in 14 instances; 14 written notices were served with respect to these matters.

The slaughter houses in the Borough have been inspected on 53 occasions by the Inspectors. 56 Cowhouses. The four cowhouses in the Borough have been visited on 9 occasions, and the required cleansing has been duly enforced on 8 occasions. Horse Slaughterer. The one horse-slaughtering house in the Borough has been visited by the Inspector on 40 occasions, and cleansing of the premises was required on three of these visits. Other Scheduled Offensive Trades. The 63 other premises where these offensive trades are carried on, notably within the precincts of the Foreign Animals' Wharf, Deptford, have been frequently visited, and the requirements of this Authority have always immediately received attention. Considerable works of redrainage of the Slaughter Houses, Tripe Houses, &c., have been carried out during the year, and other measures in connection with the methods of dealing with the manure, offal, &c. The majority of the businesses conducted on these premises have been established for long periods of time, in fact, before the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and in that way appear to be exempt from the provision of that Act requiring that such businesses should only be carried on after receiving the consent of the County Council so to do. In the early part of the year the London County Council communicated with this Council, alleging that complaints had been made to them with respect to one of the businesses carried on in these premises, namely, the Oleo Works, of the London Butchers Hide and Skin Co. The spotless cleanliness and freedom from any sort of offensive odour of these premises being well known to this Department, this complaint occasioned 57 considerable surprise, and accordingly a request was made for definite particulars as to the complainants and the nature of their complaint. The County Council at the same time alleged that the business carried on at the Oleo Works was the business of a Tallow Melter, and accordingly this business, having been established since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, was being illegally carried on, as that Act entirely prohibits the establishment of the business of a Tallow Melter within the County of London. After the expiration of some six months, during which time nothing was heard from the County Council on the matter, this Council was supplied with information obtained by one of the County Council Inspectors, alleging that certain people had complained to him in the course of his investigations during the summer of the offence occasioned by these works. There seemed to be some misapprehension on this matter, for during the summer these premises had continued to receive our special observation, and on no single occasion had there been the slightest cause for complaint. It was thought advisable to see the persons who it was alleged had complained to the County Council's Inspector; they were interviewed, and in no case was the allegation substantiated, in fact, more than one of the persons mentioned definitely denied having complained of the premises indicated. In view of the further allegation that the business carried on was that of a Tallow Melter, I had in the meantime been making myself thoroughly acquainted with the whole facts of the case, and had also visited the premises of other recognised and authorised Tallow Melters, and also visited the premises of certain Tallow Melters and Soap Manufacturers situated outside 58 the County of London, who had supplied certain information to the London County Council with respect to the business carried on at the Oleo Works. As a result of my investigations I came to the opinion that the business carried on at these premises was not that of a Tallow Melter. Having reported thus to the Public Health Committee, they decided to reply to the County Council to the effect that on the evidence before them it did not appear that there was any ground for them to take the proceedings required by the London County Council against the London Butchers Hide and Skin Co. for carrying on the business of Tallow Melters, as alleged, in the Foreign Cattle Market, Deptford. Within a few days of the receipt of this reply, the London County Council declared this Council to be in default in the matter, and intimated their intention to take proceedings against the Company. During the present year these proceedings have been taken, and the Magistrate has decided in favour of the Company and against the London County Council; that Council, however, have given notice of their intention to appeal against the decision. As the Magistrate (A. Gill, Esq.) in a very careful judgment gives a resumé of the whole matter, and practically adopts the arguments and contentions of this Council, it may be instructive to set it out in full. This result, even though it should be upset on appeal, shews at any rate that there was reasonable ground for this Council to take the attitude it did in the matter. In giving judgment, Mr. Gill said:—The defendant company are summoned on an information which charges them with having at the Foreign Cattle Market, Deptford, unlawfully established 59 anew the business of tallow melters. They have unlawfully carried it on contrary to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 19, Sub-section 1. The Greenwich Borough Council is, under Section 29, the authority primarily charged with the duty of enforcing the Act, but in the exercise of their discretion they refrained from taking action. In the course of last year the London County Council drew the attention of the Greenwich Borough Council to the nature of the defendants' business, and suggested that it was being carried on in breach of the Act. After some correspondence the County Council, on the 4th of December last, wrote that their Public Health Committee had taken up the matter, and resolved on the facts before them that there was sufficient reason to institute the proceedings suggested by the London County Council. Accordingly the latter body took these proceedings in pursuance of the provisions of Section 100 of the Act. A preliminary point had been taken by Mr. Clarke Hall, but has not been strongly urged, that the London County Council were not properly authorised to institute these proceedings, but Sub-section 9 is as follows: "Nothing in this Section shall render the order of the London County Council necessary to authorise the slaughter of cattle at the Metropolitan Cattle Market, or at the Cattle Market at Deptford, or shall authorise the making of any by-laws affecting either of these markets or slaughterhouses erected there, either before or after the passing of this Act." In my opinion that Sub-section does not limit the operation of Sub-section A, which simply forbids the establishment of certain trades with reference to the slaughtering of cattle, or the by-laws of the London County Council. The material facts of this case are as follows:— In 1901 the defendant company established in the Deptford 60 Cattle Market, in premises leased to them by the Corporation of London, a factory for the purpose of making oleo from fat of oxen and sheep there slaughtered. A considerable amount of capital had been invested in the plant of that business. About 90 per cent. of the fat which enters the factory is treated after a further cleansing and refrigerating process, and is passed through a mascerating machine, in which it is chopped up, and then passed on to steam jacketting kettles, where it is subjected to a heat of 150 degrees. The fat so rendered, which is termed premier jus, is then passed into cloths and subjected to pressure, and the more liquid oils pass away, leaving behind a large residue called stearine. The oil thus extracted is termed oleo, which forms one of the main constituents of margarine made by the defendant company. About ten per cent. of the fat that enters the factory, although pure, is not used for making oleo, but is dealt with in a different manner. It is passed into two large digestors into which steam is driven at high pressure, melting the fat and separating it from the fibrous tissue. The fat so rendered is mainly sold for culinary purposes. This process forms a minor or subordinate branch of the defendant company's business, which is primarily or mainly with oleo manufacture. The material used in both cases is pure, no objectional fumes are generated by either melting process, and the business of the company is carried on without creating a nuisance. It is therefore not within the mischief aimed at by the statute, which is directed against a nuisance. But the Section under which this information is laid, absolutely prohibits the establishment of certain manufactured materials, which the legislature views as either necessarily offensive, or likely to be so, and therefore it is undesirable that they should be established there. If, therefore, the business of the defendant company comes within 61 one of the prohibited classes, it is not open to them to raise the defence that in fact it is conducted in such a manner as not to be offensive, and that it is not a nuisance. If the business of the defendant company is that of tallow melters, although it has been carried on for eight years without interference, and although in fact no one is injured by it, it must be closed in Deptford, whatever loss it may involve to the defendants. Substantially, therefore, the only issue before me is apparently the simple question, whether the defendants' business is one of tallow melters within the meaning of the statute. Neither side has cited a dictionary, and I do not think in this case any assistance is to be received from them. Mr. Avory contends that tallow is melted fat, sheep and oxen, with the fibrous tissue removed. Mr. Clarke Hall admits this description, but contends that this description does not hold good, and that the melted fat of sheep and oxen is not necessarily tallow. On the side of the prosecution a number of distinguished expert witnesses have given evidence, and as many have been called for the defence. It would be both difficult and invidious to attempt to determine whether those called on the one side or the other side are the more eminent. Those for the prosecution expressed the opinion that the business of the defendant company is that of tallow melting, and those for the defence are equally emphatic that it is not. For the prosecution further witnesses had been called representing two firms of soap makers, Messrs. John Knight, Ltd., and Messrs. Cooke & Co., Ltd., and it is suggested for the defence that these witnesses are not entirely disinterested in these proceedings, inasmuch as the formation of the defendant company has interfered with their purchase of fat from the Deptford market at soap makers' prices. That is a matter with which i am not concerned. For the defence there 62 were called, besides officials of the company, several independent witnesses, who spoke to the term "tallow melting" as understood by the trade. Four of these are representatives of firms carrying on business both as oleo makers and tallow melters at Birkenhead, which appears to be a main centre of that industry in England. These witnesses, whose evidence appears to me to be important, assent to the view that tallow melting is not applied to the rendering of sweet fat for the purpose of manufacturing oleo. For the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of tallow melting under the Section, guidance is afforded by the list of businesses which are there classed with tallow melting and subjected to the same restrictions. They are the businesses of blood boiler, bone boiler, manure manufacturer, knackers, as well as tallow melters, and are classed as offensive trades. The Public Health Act of 1848, Sub-section 64, provides that the business of blood boiler, bone boiler, fellmonger, slaughterer of cattle, horses and animals of any description, soap boiler, tallow melter, tripe boiler, or other obnoxious and offensive businesses or trades shall not be established in any district without the consent of the Local Board of Health. Then comes the Public Health Act of 1875, which by Section 112 prohibits the establishment in the district of any urban authority without their consent in writing any offensive trade—that is to say, the trade of soap boiler, bone boiler, blood boiler, fellmonger, tripe boiler, or any other noxious or offensive trade, business, or manufacture. It is to be observed therefore, that the Public Health (London) Act of 1891 reproduces with modifications the earlier enactments of restricting in populous places the establishment anew of any offensive trade such as tallow melting, which, as I understand, was an industry established in England at the time of the 1891 Act, as carried on by 63 the defendants. It can hardly be contended that tallow melting under the Act of 1891 means something different or more comprehensive than tallow melting under the Acts of 1848 and 1875. As to what it was understood to mean under the Act of 1848, guidance may be obtained from the dicta of Mr. Justice Erle and Mr. Justice Wills in "Wanstead Local Board of Health v. Hill, 13 C.B.N.S., 479." Justice Erle said all the trades mentioned dealt with specific substances which were or must necessarily become in themselves offensive. Similar dicta are to be found in the judgment of Justice Wills. It is clear from their observations which are made inter alia in reference to what is called tallow melting under the Act are not applicable to businesses such as the defendant company's, or with the substances with which they deal. In my opinion, tallow melting under the Public Health (London) Act, as Mr. Justice Erle said, makes the business ejusdem generis with the other trades specified—that is to say, trades in which substances are dealt with which in the ordinary course are of an offensive character, and that it does not apply to the preparation of an article of food manufactured entirely from pure, wholesome materials. The business of this company is analogous to the making of dripping, which is said to be practised by many butchers, and which appears to be essentially different from tallow melting under this Act. Tallow from which candles are made may be stale or putrid, because it is cheaper, and practically as well adapted for the purpose, and the distinction between the business of oleo making and tallow melting, then, is this: that the former is the manufacture of an article of food from pure materials, and with scrupulous regard to cleanliness, while the article intended for candles could not be intended for food, and in a dirty condition, and almost invariably of impure 64 materials. I have come to the conclusion, therefore, that although the question is not one, in my opinion, free from difficulty, that the rendering of sweet fat as understood in this business of oleo making is not what the statute was directed against as a nuisance meant by tallow melting. A more difficult question is raised in reference to the minor branch of the defendant company's business, in which the fat is rendered by means of steam digestors In this connection reliance has been placed by the prosecution on the transactions which took place between the defendant company's brokers and Messrs. John Knight & Co., Ltd. In the early part of last year, on the 13th of April, they sold to John Knight and Co. what was described in the contract note as "5 tons Deptford No. 2 rendered fat," and Messrs. John Knight & Co. paid for it; but instead of sending the company the invoice to be receipted they sent a credit note made out by themselves, in which the description of the article was changed to "No. 2 town tallow." This credit note was receipted by the clerk in the employment of the defendant company's broker, who, so far as I can know, did not notice the alteration made. That is not a matter which, in my opinion, can be used as evidence as against the defendant company. In another case cited the material was described as tallow, but the explanation given for this fact is that the railway company had no special rate for oleo, and the word "tallow" was used, as the only one suitable under the circumstances. Now oleo forms 90 per cent. of the company's traffic, and this was dealt with by the railway company as tallow; but that does not alter the fact that the article was not tallow but oleo. The position, then, is this: on the one hand is an article which it is now admitted is only capable of being made into soap or candles and is purchased only by soap makers, and on the other hand 65 an article which is made exclusively from pure and wholesome raw material, is manufactured without nuisance, and is intended as an article of food, and as such is prepared with special regard to cleanliness, and whose manufacture is subject to inspection by public officials, and, as in the case of other foods, it would be liable to seizure and condemnation. These conditions, in my opinion, are radically different from those which prevail in the business of tallow melters as commonly understood and contemplated by the Statute. I have come to the conclusion, therefore, and that not without hesitation, that I can draw no distinction between the premier jus rendered by and for oleo and that rendered in the digestors. The test, therefore, is whether the preparation of this article is tallow melting within the Statute, and turns upon whether it is intended for food, and the fact that on an isolated occasion the term has been applied to it for technical purposes does not alter its character. The summons will therefore be dismissed. The summons was accordingly dismissed, with fifty guineas costs, and leave to appeal granted.* Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order. At the commencement of the year, there were 210 premises on the Register of Dairies and Milkshops; 17 new applications have been received during the year and added to the Register, and 17 names have been taken off, thus leaving a total of 210 premises now registered. During the year 390 visits of inspection have been paid to these premises; notices were served upon the occupiers in 12 cases, 10 of which were for dirty premises generally, in 1 case for dirty milk vessels and utensils, and in 4 instances for general insanitary conditions. *i understand that the London County Council have, on further consideration, decided not to appeal in this case, but to be satisfied with the licensing of this firm as Fat Melters, which licence they have all along been willing to take out, in accordance with our request. 66 Ice Cream Premises. There were 118 premises known at the commencement of the year where the mauufacture of this commodity was carried on, 9 have been added during the year and 12 taken off, leaving a total of 115 premises. These premises were inspected on 134 occasions, and improvements, either by way of cleansing of the premises in 15 cases, or the remedying of sanitary defects in 5 cases, and 2 suitable ash receptacles required. Food Preparation. Places where food is prepared have been visited on 167 occasions, improvements being required in 47 instances, as detailed below:— Class of Premises. Number on Lists.

Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. No applications were received during the year for certificates under these Acts. 67 Housing of the Working Classes. Premises have been found to be overcrowded in 24 cases, which have all been abated, and in 8 cases the illegal use of underground rooms has been discontinued. Five hundred and fifteen houses have been generally repaired; 313 premises have been cleansed, limewashed, and repaired; 33 have been improved as regards their ventilation; 169 premises have had the walls and ceilings cleansed throughout, and 236 premises have been partially cleansed; leaky house roofs and gutters have been repaired in 326 cases; nuisances from dampness have been abated in 151 cases; dampness of walls has been remedied in 112 cases; direct connection between the internal sanitary fittings of houses and the drain have been disconnected, trapped, and amended in 268 cases; similarly 100 stack pipes have been disconnected trapped, and amended; 6 houses have been abolished as unfit for habitation; and want of underfloor ventilation has also been attended to in 7 cases. Houses Let in Lodgings. Out of a number of such premises which have been reported to the Committee, it has been decided during 1908 to register 10, which together with the thirteen on the register at the end of 1907, gives a total of 23 premises on the Register of Houses Let in Lodgings at the end of the year. More recently, however, as a result of more pressing enquiries by the London County Council as to what this Council was doing in the matter, the Public Health Committee have directed that more houses of this class shall be placed upon the Register so that they may be inspected more regularly. House Drainage. Two hundred and eighty-four house drainage systems have been reconstructed; 255 such systems 68 have also been opened, cleansed and amended; 85 new systems and 248 surface drains have been constructed; 104 systems have been tested by smoke and 390 by water, of which number 291 were found to be defective; 66 new soil pipes and 490 traps have been fixed, together with 55 intercepting chambers, and 10 other chambers. Four cesspools have been abolished; 58 areas, 168 yards, and 6 mews and stables have been thoroughly drained. Forty-nine water closets and 1 urinal have been erected, and 1 abolished; a pan, trap and water supply have been furnished throughout in 176 cases, and other fittings in 390 cases, whilst the water supply has been renewed in 138 instances. The water supply for lavatory purposes has been disconnected from the drinking water system in 32 instances. Fifty-five public-house urinals have been cleansed and repaired, whilst a water supply has been laid on or repaired at 3 such conveniences. Combined Drainage. The very useful Bill, to which attention was drawn in my last Annual Report, did not, however, obtain Parliamentary sanction during the year and is again to be brought forward during the current year, when it is to be devoutly hoped that it may become law. SEWERAGE. As stated in my last Annual Report, this department still continues to receive complaints as to offensive smells emanating from the London County Council's main sewer as it passes through the Borough. Communications have frequently passed between the two authorities. Conferences between the two authorities have been held, various promises have been made and withdrawn. Much trouble has been occasioned to this department in obtaining sites for the erection of ventilating 69 shafts both free and for a nominal charge, but up to the present nothing whatever has been done to abate this nuisance. Undoubtedly it must with truth be said that as far as nuisances of this sort are concerned in this Borough, the London County Council by means of their main sewerage system are the most serious offenders. The following is an illustration of the peculiar methods at times adopted by the London County Council. This Council has had a sewer passing along Wellington Road, Charlton, for some time, and we have never received complaints with respect to any offensive smells emanating from the surface manholes of this sewer until the warm weather in the early part of the summer, when serious complaints began to be made by residents and others from this neighbourhood. The offensive emanations were readily traced to an open surface manhole in the roadway, and as the London County Council had recently taken into use their new outfall sewer, which crosses this road, having at this spot a surface ventilator in the roadway, it was thought that the smell came from the new County Council outfall sewer. I immediately wrote to the County Council officials drawing their attention to these complaints, when they very quickly replied that the smells emanated from our local sewer grating, and not from their surface ventilator which was sealed up. This being such an unusual condition of affairs for our local sewer, an investigation was made and it seems that at the time the new outfall sewer, passing across the Wellington Road, Charlton, below this Council's sewer which passes along the road, was constructed, a vertical connection some 22 feet long was made from the lower new outfall sewer up into the local Wellington Road sewer, this connection being made entirely against the wish of this Council and their officers; 70 thus this vertical shaft was passing a very objectionable odour from the County Council's new outfall sewer up into our local sewer, thence through our local sewer grating into the roadway; accordingly although the smells evidently arose from the new outfall sewer yet they emanated from our surface ventilator, and the County Council's reply to our complaint would seem to indicate that they would wish to make this Council responsible for the objectionable smells complained of. Needless to say steps were immediately taken to satisfactorily deal with this vertical shaft. Unfortunately it has been thought that this Council could take no action short of an action in the High Court, which doubtless would have to go to the Highest Court and thus occasion considerable expenditure, but during the year the opinion of A. MacMorran, Esq., M.A., K.C., has been taken and as this indicates there may be another method for taking action, definite evidence upon which to base the case is now being collected. I certainly think it is a great pity that the London County Council who profess to have the public health and the good of the public generally so much at heart have not seen their way to do something, for even although it might turn out to be ineffectual, still the fact of having attempted something would shew their willingness to act up to their profession in the matter. Especially when measures which it is thought would prove at any rate helpful could be adopted at a very trifling expense. It is with much regret that I have to place on record the fact that the large amounts of money expended by the County Council in providing the relief sewers through this district have not been entirely effectual. At times of sudden great rainfall, 71 doubtless combined with certain states of the tide, we still find that the water from the sewers backs up and discharges into the yards and premises of the low lying parts of this Borough. Refuse Removal. New ash receptacles have been provided in 411 cases, and 12 complaints on this subject have been forwarded to the Surveyor for his attention. Offensive Trade Refuse. The arrangement entered into with Messrs. Hempleman & Co., of West Ham, still continues to work very satisfactorily. Public Sanitary Conveniences. The list of Public Sanitary Conveniences, Urinal, Fountains and Horse Troughs situated within the Borough is now as follows Public Sanitary Conveniences (with accommodation for both sexes )— At junction of South Street with Greenwich Road. At junction of Blackwall Lane with Woolwich Road. At junction of Creek Road with High Street. Urinals— " Ordnance Arms," Lewisham Road. Straightsmouth. King William Street. Park Row, "King William the Fourth" P.H. " Antigallican " P.H. "Woodman" P.H., Little Heath. "Angerstein" P.H., Woolwich Road. Drinking Fountains— South Street. Bridge Street. Woolwich Road. Charlton Road. " Park Gates," Blackheath. Charlton Village. Blackwall Lane. 72 Horse Troughs— Blackheath Road. Church Street. Woolwich Road. Black wall Lane. Charlton Village. Westcombe Hill. Water Supply. The water supplied throughout the whole of the District by the Metropolitan Water Board still maintains its high standard of purity. During the year 134 water supply certificates have been granted under section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 ; these certificates stating that the new houses to which they refer are supplied with a proper water supply in accordance with the Act. Defective water fittings have been renewed in 120 cases; 14 water supplies have been reinstated where the supply had been cut off; 25 water supplies have been altered so as to draw direct from the main ; the cleansing, repairing, and covering of cisterns has been required in 12 cases. Smoke Nuisances. Three hundred and sixty four observations have been taken for smoke nuisances during the year, but on only sixteen occasions was it found necessary to issue Statutory Notices for the abatement of any nuisance which was found; one prosecution has been necessary during the year on this account. Food and Drugs Acts. Four hundred and nine samples have been purchased under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, 73 of which 398 were certified to be genuine and 11 adulterated, the adulterations thus being equivalent to 2.7 per cent, of the samples taken. Of the total number of samples purchased, 135 were butter, of which 2 were adulterated; 218 were milk, of which 8 were certified to be adulterated ; the remaining adulterated sample was one of coffee. Proceedings were taken in 10 of these cases, in one case the summons was not served, as the vendor could not be traced and in the other case a cautionary letter was sent. Of the total number of samples, 49 were taken in course of, and at the place of delivery, by an Officer of this Council direct, of which number none were certified to be adulterated; 2 were bought by an Officer of the Council direct, both of which were not adulterated; the remaining 358 samples were taken by agents employed by the Officers of this Council and a small number of samples not included in the above were taken in an informal manner. The practice prevalent among the poor of buying skimmed and in fact separated milk simply because it is offered cheaply at the door is one that ought to be stopped, but up to the present time we have no power to do so as long as the Vendor makes it known that the milk he is selling is not ordinary milk. This information is generally conveyed by the Vendor in some very ambiguous way so that I fancy that many of the poor people do not thoroughly understand that they are purchasing this impoverished milk. The declaration however, is such that the Agent of the Authority purchasing such milk knows the character of the milk and therefore no proceedings can be taken against the vendor. In my opinion the feeding of young children on this impoverished milk has doubtless something to do with the 74 Infantile Mortality and also the weakly and puny condition of some of those who survive this method of feeding. When one considers that the English farmer does not think this separated milk good enough of itself wherewith to feed his calves it certainly seems out of place that mothers should be satisfied to feed their children upon it. I think those that do so err almost entirely through ignorance and are in a large measure deceived because the Vendor generally calls "Milk, Id. a quart," only occasionally interposing the cry "Skimmed Milk, Id. a quart." The noticeable difference meted out to the various defendants for the similar class of offence in the Police Court, also seems to put a premium upon causing trouble and inconvenience in the discharge of ones duties, for during the year on the same day before the same Magistrate there were two Defendants, neither of them having legal advice, one pleaded guilty to the charge of selling margarine for butter and explained certain extenuating circumstances. A fine of £3 and £2 2s. costs was imposed. The other in a much larger way of business came to the Court and with much bravado produced an Analysts Certificate which shewed that the milk was deficient in fat to the extent of 14 per cent.; she still persisted in having the third portion submitted to Somerset House for analysis, which certificate also shewed a larger deficiency of fat than our Analyst had stated. This Defendant also had a history in connection with these matters, which history we were precluded from mentioning in the Court, and yet after two adjournments on the Defendant's behalf this person was practically let off with no fine and £2 2s. costs. 75 The following Statement showing the number of samples of all kinds of Food and Drugs, and the number of samples of Milk and Butter examined in 1907, by the Public Analyst of each Local Authority under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in London, is interesting:— Borough.
