The Hoard decided in March. 1895, that a street rest and lamp should be erected in the east India Dock Road. on the boundary between Limehouse Mid Poplar, provided the Poplar District Hoard would agree to contribute one half the cost of erection, lighting, and maintenance. A communication to that effect was addressed to the Poplar Hoard, but their reply has not yet been received. A letter was received from H. Herrmann, Limited, complaining of the want of light in front of their premises, No. ll, Dod Street, Limehouse, and suggesting that two gas brackets should be fixed on the wall, one on each side of their entrance gateway, and for one of which and the lighting of the same they would be willing to pay.

I imchouse. over the entrance to Dowson's Dock. the Works Committee surveyed the bridge, and Messrs. Dowson were called upon to repair the surface of the carriageway and footways thereof, and to make the wooden crown of the carriageway sufficiently wide for two horses. A letter was received from Messrs. Dowson's Solicitors in reply, stating that the necessary repair to the bridge would be carried out, but that they did not admit any liability to alter the same as suggested by the Board FIRE ESCAPE WATCH BOX AT LIMEHOUSE. In the month of July application was made by the Chife Officer of the Metropolitan fire Brigade for permission for the Fire Escape Watch Box, it that time standing at the "Eastern" Hotel at the corner of West India Dock Road, to be stationed both day and night against the south side of the public urinal at the junction of the East and West India Dock Roads The Works Committee inspected the locality referred to and application was, upon their recommendation, granted, in the first place provisionally for a period of two months, and ultimately during the pleasure of the Board NEW MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION, Etc. The London County Council having approved the site in Horse-ferry Branch Road, referred to in my last Report, the Sanitary Committee inspected the mortuaries, etc., at St. Mary- 65 Icbonc, St. Luke's. IsIington, and Westminster and I was requested to prcpare plans and an estimate for the erection of the ncecssary buildings. Plans were accordingly prepared and forwarded to the local Government Board, and I had an inter view with an Inspector of that Board who visited the site and a letter was subsequently received asking that the buildings might he so arranged that a space of not less than 20 feet should everywhere intervene between the mortuary and disinfecting chambers and the boundary walls of the site. An amended block plan was thereupon prepared and approved by the Board, and a copy sent to the Local Government Hoard, from whom a letter was received stating that prodding the building were so arranged that a space of not less than 20 feet should everywhere intervene between them and the boundary walls, they were advivol that the land might properly be used as proposed. I reported that this requirement could be complied with, and application was made to the Council for a loan of £2,300 for the purchase of the site. I had an interview with the Vendor's Surveyor, and arranged that the boundary on the north of the site should be taken to be the centre of the existing wall, as shewn on a plan which I submitted to the Committee, and that the Hoard should pull down such wall and build a new 14-inch party wall to a height of 8 feet above the ground, and should also erect a similar wall on the west ride. the Board approved this arrangement. and authorised the Clerk to draw up an agreement with the Vendors embodying the same. At the date of closing this Report the purchase is expected to be completed within a very short time. RATCLIFF MORTUAKY AND DISINFECTING CHAMBER. A W.C. has been provided at the disinfecting station for the use of the men employed there. A platform weighing machine and a counter weighing machine were purchased from Messrs. Vandome, Titford, and 66 Pawson for the purpose of checking the weight of disinfectants supplied and of weighing the quantities given out for distribu- tion. A new gas bracket has been fixed at the disinfecting station, and the whole of the premises have been limewhited. EAST LONDON WATER WORKS COMPANY. A notice was received from the East London Water Company of their intention to open and break up the wing walls of the western side of the bridge carrying the Burdett Road over the Limehouse Cut, for the purpose of laying a 24-inch steel tube water main, forming part of a new 20-inch main, then being laid by the Company from Mile end road through burdett Road to the East and West India Dock Roads, to at to improve the water supply in that portion of the district The board made no objection to the carrying out of the works. The Company afterwards applied for the sanction of the Board to the erection of an unclimbable fence, about 6 feet high, off the retaining wall of the bridge alongside the towing path, and also a small length of spiked rails on the top of the capstone of the buttress at the south end of the bridge, tinuation and keeping with that on the top of the palisading, for the purpose of preventing boys climbing over the bridge and on to the new tube. The application was granted subject to the approval by the Hoard of the plan of the proposed fence, etc The Company laid a new 12-inch main on the north side of Commercial Road East, between White Hone Street and the Britannia Bridge and in connection therewith made an applica- tion for permission to connect two wash-outs with the Board's Hushing shaft and pulley drain at Barnes Street and Salmon Lane, Limehouse, in accordance with a sketch which was submitted to the Board. 1 he application was granted. The Company reconstructed the main in Carr Street, Limehouse, and fixed new hydrants in connection therewith. A new 9-inch main was also laid in Commercial Road East, loan 67 the new main in Burdett Road to Gill Street, and a portion of the main in the West India Dock Road was relaid. IMPROVEMENTS. BEN JONSON ROAD. As Mated in my last Annual Report, a letter was received from the Clerk of the London County Council to the effect that the Improvements Committee had resolved to recommend the Council to seek Parliamentary powers to enable the Vestry of Mile End Old Town to carry out this improvement, one half the cost, not excceding £3,070, being borne by the Council. one fourth by this Board, and one fourth by the Vestry. Having regard however, to the resolution passed by the Board on the 6th May, 1891, limiting the Board's contribution to £1,000, the board could not agree to this proposal so far as the amount to be contributed was concerned and the Improvements Committee having been informed of this fact. stated that they would not therefore be prepared to recommend the Council to seek parliamentary powers as suggested. It was at this point that the subject was left in my last Report, and it is necessary to recapitulate these facts in order to explain the subsequent proceedings. On the 11th April. 1894, a Special Meeting Was held pursuant to a requisition, and the resolution of the 6th May, 1891, limiting the Hoard's contribution to £1,000, was rescinded. At the following Meeting (25th April) a resolution was passed agreeing to pay one-fourth of the cost of the improvement, no limit being Axed . and on the 9th May this was confirmed as required by the Standing Order, and a further resolution was passed urging the London County Council to proceed with the matter as spcedily as possible This was communicated to the Council, and on the 1 ;th June a letter was received stating that the Council had determined to apply to Parliament for power for the improvement to be effected in accordance with the arrangement above referred to. 68 The plan and book of reference were subsequently received. and a Special Committee was appointed to consider the same. and also the clauses in the council's general powers bill, 1895. with regard there to, together with a similar Committee of the Mile end Vestry the joint Committees held Meeting the Offices' of the Board, and as a result the Clerk was requested to communicate with the Council Parliamentary Agent with a view to certain amendments being made in the bill. NEW THOROUGHFARE from broad strut to CRANFORD STREET, The question of the suggested formation of a new thoroughfare from Broad Street to Cranfond street. rateliff, has again engaged the attention of the Works Committee, and the further consideration thereof has been deferred. NARROW STREET The purchase of parts No. 13. 15 and 17, narrow street, Rateliff, having been completed, tenders were obtained for pulling down the premises which were subsequently demolished. The frontages were then set back, and the land thrown into the public way was paved; the vacant land was enclosed by a fence, and as arranged will be returned to the city corporation. I wrote to the Engineer of the London County Council asking that the Council would carry out the alteration rendered necessary to the two side entrances to the Rateliff Cross Sewer by the widening of the thoroughfare, and he replied that the Council was not prepared to effect the alteration unless the Board undertook to defray the cost thereof, which he estimated at £100. the Board requested me to see the engineer upon the subject, and I did so, and the matter was also brought under the notice of Messrs. pearce and Leon, Members of the Council for the Limehouse Division, who made certain representations to him. Eventually the Council decided to carry out the work at its own cost, and the Board passed a vote of thanks to Messrs. Pearce and Leon in recognition of their services in the matter. 69 The premises, No. 39. Narrow Street, being about to be sold by auction. I was instructed by the Board to make a report as to the value thereof, with a view to the acquisition of the same for the further improvement of the thoroughfare. The sale has not yet taken place. PROPOSED NEW street from broad street to brook street. In consequence of the receipt of a letter from the London County Council with respect to the disposal of the vacant land acquired under the Brook Street Improvement Scheme, and asking the opinion of the Board as to the utilisation of the same for the purposes of an open space, I was requested to prepare a plan for the formation of a new thoroughfare from Broad Street to Brook Street, through the Orchard and a portion of the vacant land referred to. 1 prepared a plan accordingly, and the Board approved the same and directed that the Council be informed that they would be prepared to carry out the improvement if the Council would contribute one half the cost, and also Out they were of opinion that it would not be advisible to devote the land in question to the purposes of an open space, bat that it should be utilised as a site for cottage dwellings. The reply of the Council was laid before the Board on the 6th February last, and was to the effect that the Council were of opinion that the amount of through traffic which would pass along the new street would not be sufficient to justify outlay from the County Funds and that the improvement was one of a local character, which, if undertaken, should be carried out by the local Authority. The letter further stated that the requirements of the traffic in the neighbourhood of Brook Street and Broad Street might be 50 altered after the provision of some additional means of communication across the Thames there, that the Council would hesitate to contribute at that time to any improvement in the locality, and that the ques- tion of the disposal of the vacant land referred to was still under consideration. 70 PROPOSED NEW STREET FROM NARROW STREET TO MEL3LAND STREET. The consideration of the question of the prorosed lorma- tion of a new street from Narrow street to Medland street. Rateliff, of which mention was male in my last report, has been deferred pending negociation with the owner of property in Narrow Street, which would be required for carrying out the scheme. HOUNISU OF Till; WOlthlX. « l.%ss» s A« I. QUEEN CATHERINE COURT AREA The claims of the owners «>f projicrtic* included in this an i were referred to the joint Works and linance Committee*, to whom I reported that after extended ncjjodaUon* with the parties interested, I hail with regard to MVM |iropcrtic* found it impossible to come to terms, the amounts claimed being in my opinion very excessive. I he Clerk was therefore instructed to take the necessary steps f.,r the confirmation of the nheme by the Local Government Board, and notices were thereu|*»n served in accordance with the provisions of the Act. I WSjS subsequently succcssful in imnrioff terms with m«»si «»f the persons concerned, but the freeholder and lessee of certain premises in Brook Street presented j>ctiti<>ns against the confirmation of the scheme, and 1 am now en^a^ed in nflgoctatioiis with a view to an agreement being arrived at with them, and the ultimate withdrawal of the petition: KING JOHN'S COURT SCHEME A letter was received from the Clerk of the London County Council, stating that the Council were ed that it was n«>t legally possible to carry out the- improvement <>| this area, a*, proposed by the Board, partly under the Housing «»l the Working Classes Act and partly under the Street Improvements Act and the Improvements Committee therefore could not at the present stage commit themselves to any definite promise upOO 71 the subject, but at the proper time they would he prepared to recommend the Council to contribute half the cost of the proposed new street, subject to its being found legal to do so. The Public Health and Housing Committee, however, feared that having regard to the advice of the Council's Solicitor, the Council had no power to contribute towards the cost of the scheme as proposed. I he Sanitary Committee subsequently made a further inspection of the locality, and visited certain houses on the north side of limehouse Causeway, with regard to the condition of which the Medical Officer afterwards made a report. The result of the Committee's deliberation was a recommendation to the Board to include some additional houses in the scheme, but the recommendation was referred back for further consideration. Ultimately, on the 11th July, the following resolution was passed by the Hoard:— "That whereas it appears to the Board, as the Local "Authority, that the closeness, narrowness and bad arrange- " inent or bad condition of the buildings hereunder mentioned, "or the want of light, air. ventilation, or proper conveniences, or "any other sanitary defect in any of such building, is dangerous "or prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants either of the "said buildings or of the neighbouring buildings, and that the " demolition or the Construction and re arrangement of the " said buildings or some of them is necessary to remedy the said "evils, and that the area comprising those buildings and the '"yards, outhouses, and appurtenances thereof, and the site "there of is too small to be dealt with as an unhealthy area "under Part I. of the Mousing of the Working Classes Act, " 1890:— "Three Colt Street—Nos. 109, 11, 113, 115. and 117. " Limehouse Causeway, north side—Site of No. 76, and " Nos. 78. 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, and 90. " Limehouse Causeway, south side Nos. 73. 75, 77, and "79; of Nos. 81, 83, 85, 87, and 89; and Nos. ; ,93, "and 95. 72 "Gill Street—No. 80. "King John's Court—Sites of Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7; and "Nos. 9, 11, and 13. "South part of Limehouse Causeway. "King John's Court A further resolution was passed for the preparation by the Surveyor and Medical Officer of a scheme for the improvement of the said area and the Board subsequently approved a plan which I prepared in accordance therewith, and I was requested to communicate with the London County Council with regard thereto. A letter was received complaining of the nuisance arising in King John's Court, and suggesting that the Board should put up gates so as to prevent a recurrence there of, and the matter having been considered by th Works Committee the Board gave directions for a temporary wood to be fixed at each end of the Court with a view to the prevention of nuisances in the future. SEWER VENTILATION Complaint having been made of the nuisance caused by the emanation of noxious effluvia from the ventilating shaft fixed by the London County Council at the top of Ratcliff Cross Stairs, in Narrow Street, Ratcliff, a letter was addressed to the Council asking that in order to obviate the nuisance in question the height of the shaft might be increased. In April, 1894, I communicated with the Engineer of the Council respecting an offensive smell arising from the ventilators connected with the Main Sewer in Limehouse Causeway and Nightingale Lane, Limehouse, and he replied that a flap was about to be fixed to prevent the foul air passing upward from the Low Level Sewer. 73 A letter was received from a resident in Aston Street, Limehouse, complaining of the nuisance caused by a ventilator in the middle of that thoroughfare opposite his house As a temporary measure I had the ventilator stopped with wood, and, the Work Committee having considered the matter, directions were given for a ventilating shaft to be carried up the front of the house in lieu of the open ventilator in the road, the consent of the owner having been obtained. Mr. Lehmon, of Salmon Lane, Limehouse, made some alterations in his apparatus for preventing the emanation of effluvia from sewers, to which reference was made in my last Annual Report, and after a further trial of the same the Board did not consider the apparatus efficacious in action and therefore decided not to adopt it LONDON STREETS AND BUILDINGS BILL. This Bill, and the course taken by the Hoard with regard thereto,was referred to in my last report. Subsequent to the proceedings therein reported a letter was received from the Vestry of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington, to the following effect, and the Board expressed their agreement therewith:- (a) "That, looking to the repeated demand which has been "made on behalf of the Local Authorities that they should be "vested with the administration of the Buildings Acts in their "respective districts, it is most desirable that legislation, as "regards the Local Government of the Metropolis, defining and "enlarging the functions of the Local Authorities,should precede *any legislation for consolidating and amending the Metropolitan Building Acts. (b) "That a Bill, altering and largely extending the public "law, and repealing a number of public statutes, should be a " public and not a private measure." 74 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) BILL. 1894. In my last Annual Report I referred to serveral details in this Hill to which the Board objected, and with regard to which they presented a Petition against the Bill to the House of Commons. By Clause 4 of the Bill it wan proposed to enact that no street should be closed or stopped up by a District Board or Vestry during the execution of any paving, sewering, or other works,otherwise than with the previous sanction in writing of the Council and subject to and in accordance with such conditions as might be prescribed by such sanction, and heavy penalties were attached to the contravention of this enactment. This was one of the points to which the Board objected, and the clause was ultimately withdrawn from the Bill. The Bill also contained a clause for the purpose of enforcing the efficient lighting of common staircases at night, the principle of which the Board approved. "I he original clause, however, was unanimously rejected by the Select Committee of the House of Commons, and the Council forwarded to the Board a copy of the clause as passed by such Committee, and as the same was entirely permissive the Council asked the opinion of the Board as to whether it should be withdrawn or retained in the Bill, having regard to the fact that the original form could not be restored unless the House of Commons adopted the unusual course of over-ruling the finding of its Committee. The Bill as drawn proposed to cast the expense of lighting the staircases Upon the owners, but by the altered form one-half the cost of the gas consumed between 11.30 p.m. and 6 a.m. was to fall upon the Local Authority. Under all the circumstances the Board were of opinion that the clause should be withdrawn, and the Council was informed accordingly. PUBLIC BUILDINGS (LONDON) BILL. Colonel Hughes, M.P., forwarded to the Board a copy of this Bill, together with a Memorandum upon the subject. Lon- 75 don Local Authorities with three exceptions have not the power to purchase land for their public buildings, except by agreement Two of the exceptions are the School Hoard and the Asylums Board, who can purchase compulsorily under the Lands Clauses Act after public enquiry and obtaining the consent of the Local Government Board, who make a Provisional Order, which has to be confirmed by Parliament. Under the Local Management Act. 1894, Parish Councils arc given this power. and every Local Hoard (other than in the Metropolis) has it under the Public Health Act, 1875. which also applies to the Parish of Woolwich. To avoid the delay and expense Caused by the want of this power for all other London Local Authorities the Hill provided that public buildings erected out of rates might be built in the most central and commanding position necessary for the convenience and the architectural adornment of the locality, on freehold land. The Board expressed their approval of the Bill, and the Government were informed thereof; it did not, however, pass into law. STREET NOMENCLATURE. Olders have been made by the London County Council as follows, viz.:- For numbering certain houses and premises at the western end of Northey Street, Limehousc. For re-naming Juniper Row, Shadwell, "Juniper Street." For re-numbering the houses and premises in Trigg's Place and Olivers Court. Limehouse, abolishing the name "Trigg's Place," and re-naming the whole "Chivers Court." For re-numbering the houses in Gloucester Street, Limehouse, and re naming the thoroughfare "Notgrove Street. 76 For numbering the houses and premises in Willow Row and Thomas's Cottages, Limehouse, abolishing the name "Thomas's Cottages" and re-naming the whole "Willow Row". For re-numbering the houses and premises in York Street West and Barnes Street in Limehouse and Ratcliff, abolishing the names "York Street West" and "York Terrace," and re-naming the whole line of thoroughfare - Barnes street " A letter was received from the London County Council asking the views of the Board with regard to an an application by the owner of premises in Black Bull Court. Ratcliff, for the court to be re-named "Rhine Place." The Board ascertained the opinion of the Ratcliff Vestry upon the subject, which wan to the effect that they aw no reason why the name of the Court should be changed, and the Council were informed accordingly. In November, 1894. the Council asked for an expression of the Board's opinion as to the desirability of re-numbering Well Street, Wapping. and the Board replied that they offered no objection thereto. HOUSES ON LOW-LYING LAND. The London County Council forwarded to the Board a copy of Regulations which had been made under Section 7 of the Council's General Powers Act, 1893, prescribing the course to be followed by applicants for permission to erect or adapt dwelling houses on low-lying land, and also with respect to the erection or adaptation of such houses. The Board gave directions for the same to be printed and circulated among the builders and others in the District. The Regulations are as follows:— " Every person who shall be desirous of erecting or adapting any building to be used wholly or in part as a dwelling-house on any land in the county of London of which the surface is below the level of Trinity high-water mark, and which is so situate as not to admit of 77 being drained by gravitation into an existing sewer of the Council shall first make a written application for a licence. Such application shall be addressed to the Clerk of the Council. "Such application shall contain a statement as to the nature and extent of the interest of the applicant in the building or building proposed to be erected or adapted, and be accompanied by a plan and section of the lowest floor of such building or buildings and the curtilage thereof to a scale of 1/8th of an inch to a foot, and by a block plan to a scale of not less than (which may he on a sheet or sheets of the Ordinance Survey, or may be drawn on tracing linen), showing the position of such building or buildings and the local sewer into which it is proposed to drain such building or buildings, and the connection of such local sewer with an existing sewer of the Council. " Such plans and sections shall be accompanied by a description of the materials to be used in the construction of such building or buildings, and shall be coloured in accordance therewith. The points of the compass be marked on the block plan. "The position and course of the drainage system proposed to be adopted for the disposal of sewage and rain water, and its connection with the local sewer or an existing sewer of the Council, shall be clearly shown on the plans and sections, and the diameter and inclination of the drain pipes shall be figured thereon. "The plan and section shall also indicate in figures the level above or below ordinance datum at which it is proposed to construct the floor of the lowest rooms. "The decision given by the Chief Engineer of the Council upon such application shall be reported to the Main Drainage Committee, and the Committee shall report it to the Council, and thereupon, if it is to the effect that the erection or adaptation may not be permitted, the Clerk of the Council shall by letter inform the applicant that the Council, acting upon the decision of the Engineer, has refused permission. If it is to the effect that the erection or adaptation may be permitted, a license under the seal of the Council embodying the conditions of the Engineer's decision shall be issued to the applicant. "It shall not be lawful to place the underside of the lowest floor of any permitted building at such a level as will render it liable to flooding, 78 and every permitted building shall be efficiently and properly drained to the satisfaction of the Engineer for the time being of the Council, either into a local sewer or into a main sewer of the Council. REINSTATEMENT OF PAVING. Etc., DISTURBED BY GAS AND WATER COM PANIES In consequence of the defective condition of the macadam carriageway of Pigott Street, Limehouse, I was requested to communicate with the Commercial Gas Company who had opened the same in a great many places for the purpose of laying new services, thereby conducing to its unsatisfactory state. I accordingly addressed a letter to the Engineer of the Company upon the subject, and suggested that the Company should bear the expense incurred from time to time in making good the roadway until the same was restored to its original condition The Engineer replied to the effect that he could see no sufficient reason for dealing with the road referred to in other than the ordinary manner, and I was subsequently requested to see him upon the question, and as result he wrote a further letter stating that under the circumstances he would be prepared to recommend the Directors to contribute a sum of £7, in addition to the amount to be paid by the Company in the ordinary way, for the reinstatement of the roadway. I was thereupon requested to report as to the cost of putting the street in proper condition, and upon receiving my estimate, which amounted to £80, the Board directed that the Company should be asked to contribute one half of the cost of the work. To this the Engineer replied that Under the circumstances he was unable to recommend the Directors to depart in any respect from the position they had taken in the matter. Under these circumstances the opinion of Counsel was taken as to the position of the Board, and this having been received notice was given to the several Companies terminating the then existing arrangements pending the settlement of some more satisfactory agreement, and it was reffered to the Works Committee to consider what arrangement should be made. It 79 was also resolved that no further action should be taken as to the claim against the Gas Company with regard to the reinstatement of the carriageway of Pigott Street. Subsequently the attention of the Companies was callcd to the Section of the Act of Parliament by which the Hoard were empowered to reinstate paving, etc . disturbed, and to charge the cost to them. and they were informed that the Hoard would exercise this power unless some satisfactory understanding was arrived at with regard to unpaved roads. Letters were received in reply stating that the Companies would be prepared to discuss any representations the Board might make upon the subject, and these letters were under consideration when this Report was closed. « DUST REMOVAL. In September, 1894. I received a letter from the Superintending Architect of the London County Council asking what arrangements would be made by the Hoard for the removal of dust from Beachcroft Buildings Brook Street, Ratcliff, in reply to which I informed him that the tenants would be furnished with dust pails, which would emptied twice a week by the Board's contractors. He shortly afterwards wrote a further letter asking whether the same arrangements for dust removal would be made at the new Artisans' Dwellings in Cable Street. Shadwell, but as these buildings are five stories high I replied, in accordance with the direction of the Board, that if the Council would provide pails for containing the house refuse and arrange for them to be brought to the entrance; the Board would have the dust removed daily and would not require the provision of dust bins. Directions were given for the daily removal of refuse from Dr. Barnardo's Homes, Stepney Causeway, upon condition that pails were provided by the Home Authorities and brought to the entrance to be emptied, and also from Her Majesty's Hospital in connection with the former institution. The Board also directed that there should be a daily removal of refuse from coffee and eating houses. 80 WATER SUPPLY. The Board approved the course adopted by the Fulham Vestry in presenting a petition to the Local Government Board in favour of the promotion of a Bill in Parliament for the purpose of preventing the arbitrary cutting off of the water supply from inhabited houses. The London County Council forwarded to the Board prints of eight Rills for the transfer to the Council of the eight London Water Companies and the same having been referred to the Works Committee, copies of the East London Water Works ( Transfer) Hill were obtained for the use of the Committer, and upon their recommendation the Board approved the principle of the Bill and the Council were informed accordingly. In August, 1894, 1 communicated with the Engineer of the Water Company with regard to the shutting off of the water supply at night, and he replied that it had been found necessary to shut off the water throughout the Company's district of supply from about 9 p.m. until 6 a.m., on account of the storage reservoirs being nearly deplected, and that the constant supply would be resumed immediately there was any prospect of an increased flow in the River Lea. A circular letter was received a few weeks later explaining that this step was rendered necessary as the storage in the reservoirs had fallen far below the usual quantity ©wing to deficient rainfall and the confluent non-repletion of the springs which suffered from the drought of the previous year. The subject led to much discusion by the Hoard, as a result of which the fallowing resolution was passed:— "That in the opinion of this Hoard the action of the Last "London Works Company in shutting off the water from "8.30 p.m. to 7 a.m. is dangerous to life and property in the "event of fire, and also dangerous to the health of the district, "more especially in cases of sudden illness; and that this Board "do respectfully ask the London County Council to bring pres"sure to bear on the East London Water Works Company to 81 "give the District, a constant supply; and that this Board is " further of opinion that the time has arrival when the supply of "water should be no longer in the hands of a private company." Very strong representations were made to the Company by the Board and other Local Authorities as to the inconvenience caused by the partial cessation of the constant service, and the Company convened a conference for the purpose of considering whether a plan could be devised when by such inconvenience could be minimised The Medical Officer represented the Board at the conference, and the Company's Engineer promised to endeavour to delay the shutting off until 10 p.m. The water supply was again very seriously affected in January and February of the present year in consequence of the prolonged severe frost, when the supply pipes of most of the houses in the District were frozen. At the beginning of the period the Water Company endeavoured to meet the requirements of the inhabitants by providing stand pipes in the streets, but these proved altogether inadequate, and on Saturday, the l6th February, I received a telegram from the Engineer of the Company, stating that he would be glad if the Board would send out water carts at the Company's expense for the distribution of water to residents in the District who most required it. The necessary arrangements were at once made, and came into operation on the following day, Sunday, 17th February, and the steps which had been taken were reported to the Works Committee, and on their recommendation the Board expressed satisfaction With the course adopted. The distribution of water was continued until the 4th March, the cost incurred, and chargeable to the Company, being £ 112. CLEANSING GULLEYS. By Section 16 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1894, it enacted that "the duty of cleansing "every grating and gulley in any street communicating with "any sewer of the Council (except in streets vested in and 82 "cleansed by the Council) so far as such grating or gulley "belongs to or is under the control of the Council should "as "from the passing of the Act be transferred to the Vestry of the "parish or the Board of Works for the District within which the " same is situate." In October, 1894, a letter was received from the Council stating that although the duty of cleansing devolved upon the Local Authorities as from the passing of the Act. the Council in order to give time for the necessary arrangement to be made for the purpose would continue the cleansing until the end of the year, and asking that the Board would in the meantime arrange to undertake the performance of the duty as from the 1st January, 1895. The number of gulleys in the District, affected by thr enactment is as follows:— Ratcliff 34 Shadwell 26 Wapping 18 Total 78 Since the beginning of this year the work has been carried out by the Hoard. THAMES COMMUNICATIONS. In April, 1894, the Board passed a resolution to the following effect:— "That the London County Council be informed that, having "heard that large sums have been and arc proposed to be "expended on the bridges above London Bridge, the Boards "regrets that in the Council's General Powers Hill no provision " is made for the formation of additional means of communication 83 "between the North and South sides of the River Thames be"tween the lower Bridge and the Tunnel in course of "construction at Blackwall." REGENTS CANAL DOCK. Complaints having been made of the defective W.C. accommodation at the Recent Canal Dock, some correspondence took place with the North Metropolitan Railway and Canal Company, and I saw the Engineer of the Company upon the subject. Ultimately new W.C.'s were erected with proper divisions between, and with connections to the sewer in Horseferry Branch Road. Ratcliff. CAB SERVICE. A Inter was received from the Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee on the Metropolitan Cab Service, asking for any suggestions which the Board might desire to make with regard to the provision of Cab Stands and Shelters. The Board replied that they had no suggestions to make on these points, but that they were of opinion that the limit of the present radius should be extended from Lowell Street to the East India Dock Gates. SNOW STORMS. In consequence of snow storms, which occurred on several days in the months of January, February, and March, 1895. about 900 extra men were employed for the purpose of clearing the streets, the total cost of extra labour being TOWER BRIDGE NORTHERN APPROACH. At the invitation of the Whitechapel District Board delegates were appointed to attend a conference upon the subject of 84 the provision of a suitable and convenient northern approach to the Tower Bridge Resolutions were pasted at such conference in favour of the formation of a new street from High Street, Whitechapel, at its junction with Commercial Street, Leman Street, and Commercial Road East in a direct lime to the northern foot of the Bridge, and plans of the proposed new thoroughfare are now under consideration of the Works Committee. TRACTION ENGINES ON ROADS. The Lewisham District Hoard forwarded copy of a resolution requesting the London County Council to take steps to obtain such an amendment of the law as would prevent the continuance of the use of traction engines in London thoroughfares after 11 o'clock at night, and the Board having passed resolution agreeing therewith, the Council were informed accordingly. ST. PAUL'S ROAD. A new Roman Catholic Church and School, have been erected on the south side of St Paul's Road, Limehouse. near Bow Common Lane, and in accordance with an agreement between the owners of the site and the London County Council and the Board the line of frontage was set back, and a strip of land thrown into the public way to widen the footpath. the land in question has been paved with new 3-inch York stone. HAMMER AND CROWN COURT, RATCLIFF. The Justices having made the necessary order the site of this Court was enclosed by Messrs. Batger & Co., who have conveyed to the Board the piece of land agreed to be thrown into the Orchard and referred to in my last Report, The piece of land in question has been paved and now forms part of the public way. 85 GENERAL. Posts, Queen Street The London County Council having gested the removal of two posts at the entrance to Queen Street, Wapping, as the presence of the same rendered it impossible for a fire escape to be taken into the street, the Board gave directions for the posts to be removed, and suggested to the Council that the two posts in that portion of Queen Street situate in the parish of St. George in the East, and now known as Clegg Street, should also be removed. Bridges, Hunt's Mews A letter was received from the London County Council asking for the observations of the Board as to an application which has been made to the Council on behalf of Messrs. Norm & Co., for permission to construct two iron bridges to connect their premises on the north side of Hunt's Mew., Shad well, with premises about to be erected on the south side thereof, in accordance with a plan accompanying the letter. The Council were informed that the Board objected to the lower of the two bridges, as it was proposed to leave a headway of only nine feet under the same. The application was ultimately refused by the Council. Chambers Square Passage An application was received for the sanction of the Board to the alteration of Chambers Square Passage, Wapping, by building a wall enclosing a portion of the west side of the passage, a piece of land on the east side of equal width to that proposed to be enclosed being thrown into the passage in lieu thereof. The Board after consideration resolved not to grant the application. Snow Removal. A letter was received from the Vestry of St. Removal. Marylebone expressing the opinion that it was desirable that the duty of removing snow from footways, which under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, devolves upon the Local Authority, should be reimposed upon the occupiers and owners of the several frontages. The Vestry were informed in reply that the Hoard did not approve the same, no difficulty having been experienced in the cleansing of the footways in this District 86 London Hydraulic Power Company.
