To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report for the year 1962, a year which has been a very busy one for the department. In doing so I would like first to refer to the Vital Statistics where it will be observed that the estimated population has passed the twenty-six thousand mark, still further increasing the density of population in this small district. The birth rate has again risen and I am glad to report that the infantile mortality rates have fallen. All this points to an increased demand for primary school places in the next few years. The percentage of illegitimate births has again risen, but I would stress that this is not peculiar to Penge but is a national problem and cannot be attributed to any one age group or class of people. Deaths from cancer of the lung numbered 15 of whom three were women. It can fairly be said that the link between lung cancer and cigarette smoking is generally accepted as proven, and therefore during the year an endeavour was made to bring this home to the public by means of posters and the free distribution through Council Offices of a reprint of an article in Readers Digest. How far this method is successful in reaching the younger generation I am doubtful and feel that example by parents and others having the care of the young would probably be far more effective. The incidence of infectious disease was very small and provided full advantage of the various immunisation facilities is taken the district should remain in this satisfactory state. Although during the year I made no representations on slum clearance I had before the end of the year made my necessary inspections and was able to make the representations in January of this year. This marked the completion as far as this department is concerned in rather less than three years of the first half of the programme extending over ten years submitted to the Minister in 1960. Whilst on the subject of housing I would like to refer to a major problem in this district, that of houses let in multiple occupation of which there are probably several thousand. Elsewhere in his report the Chief Public Health Inspector refers to the difficulty encountered in dealing with two of these houses. I would like to draw attention to two sources of danger in them. The first of these is the risk of fire. Almost in every case heating is provided by an oil burning stove often without adequate protection from being knocked over or 4 affected by draught. In any one house there may be as many as eight of these stoves burning simultaneously, while the only escape from the upper floors is the wooden staircase contained within the house. The other risk is of the spread of disease of the dysentery type because there is inadequate lavatory accommodation for the number of people residing in the house. Also because the lavatories are communal property there is a tendency for no-one to keep them scrupulously clean with the result that their condition leaves much to be desired. Until we can deal with these houses more expeditiously I am afraid the problem will remain with us for a long time. It gives me pleasure once more to record the valuable help given by the various voluntary organisations in providing meals on wheels, clothing and financial help where needed in the district. To the members of the Council I would like to express my thanks for the courtesy and interest they have always shown me, and to Mr. E. G. Thomas and the Staff of the department my sincere appreciation of their willing help and co-operation in what has been a difficult and busy year. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 770 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Population (Census 1961) 25,743 Home Population, Mid-year 1962 (estimated by Registrar-General) 26,020 Rateable Value, 1st April, 1962 £361,036 Sum represented by 1d. rate £1,460 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33.8, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the Old Crystal Palace the majority of which are in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools of the district and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were approximately 188 men and 23 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Live births 644 Live birth rate per 1,000 population 24.75 Stillbirths 11 Stillbirth rate per 1,000 live and still births 16.8 Total live and still births 655 Total infant deaths 14 5 Infant mortality rates (1) Total infant deaths per 1,000 live births 21.7 (2) Total infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 24.3 (3) Total infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births 20.6 Neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 17.08 Early neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 12.4 Peri-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 29.0 Illegitimate live births per cent of the total live births 10.5 Maternal deaths (including abortion) 1 Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 total live and still births 1.5 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 644 compared with 590 in 1961. This gives a crude birth rate of 24.75 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 23.07 for 1961. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local births is 0.91. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 22.5 compared with 21.0 for 1961. Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 11, equal to a rate of 16.8 of 1,000 total births, compared with 19.7 for 1961. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 302, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 11.2 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 10.8 for 1961. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local deaths is 0.96. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 11.1 compared with 10.5 for the year 1961. The death rate for England and Wales was 11.9 compared with 12.0 recorded for 1961. Deaths among the inmates of an institution for men numbered 25. A large proportion of deaths was of elderly people, and of the total deaths 210 or 69.5% were of persons 65 years of age and over compared with 69.7% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 44.3% of the deaths compared with 44.1% for 1961. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 60 giving a death rate for Home Population of 2.3 compared with 1.7 for 1961. The rate for England and Wales was 2.17. Twelve males and 3 females died of cancer of the lungs. 6 Tuberculosis There was one death from tuberculosis in Penge, giving a death rate of .04. The rate for England and Wales was .066. Maternal Mortality There was one maternal death during the year. The rate for England and Wales was 0.35 compared with 0.33 for 1961. Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 14, corresponding to a rate of 21.7 per 1,000 births, compared with rate of 23.5 for 1961. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 21.4. Seven of these infants died under one week and there were six deaths from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1962:— Rate per 1,000 Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Total Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 24.75 16.8 11.2 21.7 England and Wales 18.0 18.1 11.9 21.4 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the area being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The Board regularly carry out bacteriological examination and chemical analysis. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Drainage and Sewerage All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham the whole of which is culverted. 7 Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing House refuse is collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse is taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. HOUSING The erection of 25 flats and conversion of one house into flats by the local authority was completed during the year. Private builders erected 18 houses and maisonettes and converted two houses into flats. 1.

To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I desire to present my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1962, in which is set out the work of the Public Health Inspectors. During the year the first smokeless zone under the Clean Air Act, 1956, came into operation on the 1st September. The area comprised 691 dwellings. The bringing into operation of this zone necessitated many surveys being made by your inspectors outside official hours, this arising from both husband and wife being at business during the day and therefore access for survey purposes could be obtained only during the evenings or at weekends. Byelaws in respect of the removal of house refuse made under Section 72 (3) of the Public Health Act, 1936, and Byelaws made under Section 77 of the Public Health Act, 1961, relative to Hairdressers and Barbers establishments came into operation during the year. Complaints, excluding those dealing with mice and rat infestation, numbered 458, the majority being with reference to housing defects and nuisances. The complaints concerning housing defects appear to be on the decline, and there is evidence that the landlord/tenant relationship following the decontrol provisions of the Rent Act, 1957, may have some bearing on this, since cases have occurred where following complaint of defects in dwellings the tenants have requested that no communication be sent to the landlord thereon since being decontrolled tenants they feared a month's notice to quit would follow the receipt by the landlord of an official notice. The execution of repair work following the receipt of official notice has become increasingly difficult owing to building trade labour shortage. Local builders who for years have carried out this class of repair work complain that they cannot secure the necessary labour. As a consequence the time taken to abate notices is increased. Slum Clearance survey continued during the year in preparation for further representations being made at an early date in 1963 of additional clearance areas in the Groves Area. SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS AND VISITS Inspection through complaints received 623 Housing Act 312 Overcrowding and measurement of rooms 14 Infectious diseases 35 Common lodging houses 24 Bakehouses 46 Dairies and Milk Distributors 125 16 Meat shops 147 Fish frying shops 52 Ice-Cream Shops 109 Cafes and restaurants 152 Food factories 131 Other food shops, stores and stalls 470 Public conveniences 36 Factories 76 Rats and mice 1,990 Outworkers 48 Schools 15 Rent Act, 1957 42 Keeping of animals 19 Drain tests 16 Food sampling 6 Movable dwellings 8 Clean Air Act, 1956 1,469 Revisits and inspections of work in hand 1,205 Miscellaneous visits 122 Shops Act inspections and patrols 389 Heating Appliances Act 6 SUMMARY OF WORK EXECUTED DURING THE YEAR Water Supply:— Water supply pipes reinstated to houses 2 Water service pipes repaired 20 Water Closets:— Water closets cleared of obstructions 1 Flushing apparatus renewed or repaired 19 New pans and traps fixed 6 Seats and doors provided or repaired 2 Drainage:— Drains tested with smoke, water or colour 20 Drains cleared or repaired 77 Sink wastepipes cleared or repaired 12 Wastepipes repaired or trapped 4 Houses with drains relaid or partially relaid 8 Inspection chambers constructed or improved 4 Soilpipes and vent pipes cleared or repaired 1 Inspection chamber covers renewed 4 Mica flaps fitted 1 Sinks provided or repaired 1 Dampness, Houses with:— Dampness in basement rooms remedied 12 Dampness in ground floor rooms remedied 6 Roofs repaired 32 Rainwater pipes repaired or renewed 9 Gutters renewed or repaired 15 Walls repointed or rendered and dampness in upper floor rooms remedied 5 Window sills repaired 1 17 Cleanliness:— Verminous rooms disinfested 59 Miscellaneous:— Houses with floor joists, etc., repaired 16 Houses with yard or forecourt paved or repaired 2 Houses with window frames, etc., repaired 4 Houses with miscellaneous defects remedied 6 Houses with doors and frames repaired or renewed 4 Houses with front and back steps repaired 3 Houses with ceiling and wallplaster repaired 20 Houses with stairs repaired 3 New sash cords provided 7 Dustbins provided 32 Accumulations removed 6 Undereaves soffits repaired 2 Wasps' nests destroyed 6 HOUSING—CLEARANCE OF UNFIT HOUSES During the year a survey of houses in the Groves area was continued with a view to the clearance of unfit houses in that area. As a result of this survey a further 43 houses were scheduled for clearance. One dwelling was reported for a demolition order. Closing Orders were made on three basements and one closing order made on a basement was determined. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION During the year Regulations made by the Minister of Housing and Local Government under the Housing Act, 1961, in respect of this class of dwelling came into operation. The object of this legislation is inter alia (i) to make good neglect of proper standards of management; (ii) to require the minimum facilities and amenities where absent; (iii) to increase penalties for failure to abate overcrowding; (iv) to limit the number of persons who may live in this class of dwelling. Decontrol, high rentals, house shortage and immigration have increased the number of this class of dwellings, and often created conditions of squalor, so that people live under conditions much inferior to those in many dwellings classified as slums. Legislation was therefore urgently required in order to deal with these conditions. Two of this class of dwelling were surveyed and the Committee authorised appropriate action. As soon as the legal formalities were started with a view to the application of the requirements set out in the Act and Regulations, the owners gave the occupants notice to quit and sold the houses. This action by the owners frustrated the efforts to implement the requirements laid down. 18 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The supervision of premises and stalls where foods are prepared, stored or exposed for sale has been regularly carried out. The classification of the various food businesses by type is as follows:— I. (a) Retail food shops (excluding cafes and restaurants and licensed premises) 148 (b) Cafes and restaurants 20 (c) Licensed premises 23 (d) Food manufacturers 19 (e) Bakehouses 4 (f) Food stalls 11 II. Number of food premises registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, used for:— (a) Sale or manufacture for purposes of sale of ice-cream or the storage of ice-cream intended for sale 97 (b) The preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale (including premises registered for onion peeling) 87 The peeling of onions at outworkers premises will not be permitted after the 31st December, 1962. III. Dairies registered under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1959 2 IV. Number of inspections of registered food premises 297 There is one ice-cream manufacturer in the district. This is limited to "soft ice-cream." Your public health inspectors continued to give advice to occupiers of food premises on matters relating to food and general hygiene. The amount of food surrendered and condemned as unfit for human consumption after examination by your inspectors was 1 ton, 3 cwt. and 3 qtr. The food condemned was as follows:— Biscuits 153 pkts. Meat Paste 3 jars Cream 5 tins Offal 28 lb. Fish 11 tins Ovaltine 1 tin Fish 635 pkts. Poultry 46 pkts. Flour Confectionery 160 pkts. Preserves 1 tin Fruit 178 tins Preserves 4 jars Fruit 3 pkts. Pudding 1 tin Gherkins 280 lb. Prunes 36 pkts. Jam 10 tins Salad Cream 1 bot. Meat 197 pkts. Soup 7 tins Meat 20 tins Sugar Confectionery 28 lb. Meat 540 lb. Vegetables 910 pkts. Milk 2 tins Vegetables 72 tins Condemnation Certificates issued—53. 19 Milk Sampling Samples of milk submitted to chemical analysis totalled 66 and all proved to be genuine. The samples gave the following averages:— Fat—3.55% (standard 3.0%). Solids not fat—8.81% (standard 8.5%). Ice-Cream During the year one shop was registered for the manufacture of ice-cream. This applied to the manufacture of "soft" ice cream. In this process the pasteurised "mix" is purchased from well-known manufacturers and fed into a small freezing machine which converts it into soft ice-cream. This type of ice-cream appears to be gaining in popularity, and it is anticipated that it will largely replace "hard" ice-cream. Samples of ice-cream were taken and submitted to the methylene blue test with the following result:— Grade I—43. Grade II—5. Grade III—9. The question of the low grading of certain samples was taken up with the Director of the Public Health Laboratory. The Director pointed out that in the interpretation of results of the examination of ice-cream attention should be paid to the actual time taken to reduce the methylene blue as well as to the actual numbers of the viable count rather than to the grading which is purely arbitrary. When the results of these two examinations are not in agreement one can assume that poor methylene blue grading arises from the presence of organisms in the ice-cream with an undue power to reduce methylene. In this connection the Director stated with one exception all the ice-cream samples submitted had relatively low bacterial count. Slaughterhouses There are no slaughterhouses in the district.
