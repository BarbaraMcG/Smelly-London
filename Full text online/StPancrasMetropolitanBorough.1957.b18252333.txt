W. 1. September, 1958 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for the year 1957; the 14th Report which I have written on the health of the Borough of St. Pancras. The population in the middle of the year, as estimated by the Registrar General, was 132,000. This compares with 133,100 in the middle of 1956, and indicates that the number of residents in St. Pancras has fallen by 1,100 during the year. On the other hand, there has been some very considerable increase in the building of office accommodation throughout the Borough, and I would mention in particular Babcock House. Gestetner's Great Northern House, and the National Union of Mineworkers in Euston Road; Mullard House, National Provincial Bank and other large blocks under construction in Tottenham Court Road; Transport Salaries Staffs Association offices in Melton Street; Transport and General Workers Union offices in Endsleigh Place and the Oetzmann sites in Hampstead Road and Camden High Street. As a result of this, I think that the day-time population of the Borough has undoubtedly increased. The character of St. Pancras continues to change from a district of individual dwellings and some factory, office and business areas, into a central London borough with large industrial buildings and blocks of flats built by the Borough Council, the London County Council, the St. Pancras Housing Association and private enterprise. Vital Statistics The number of deaths at all ages decreased from 1,528 to 1,440, and the death rate from 11.48 per thousand of the estimated population to 10.91. Infantile deaths were 47 compared with 53, with an infantile death rate of 21.1 as compared with 22.4. The number of deaths from tuberculosis was 18 as compared with 28. It is interesting to compare the situation concerning tuberculosis in 1957 with that in 1927. The number of persons in the borough notified as suffering from tuberculosis in 1957 was 1,581. It was 1,764 in 1927. In comparing these figures one must take into consideration the fact that the population in 1927 was 213,200 compared with 132,000 in 1957. In 1957 there were 254 new notifications compared with 397 in 1927. Whilst there were 18 deaths in 1957 due to tuberculosis, there were 217 in 1927. It becomes obvious from the decreased mortality that tuberculosis is becoming a curable disease and the notifications today are largely of early cases as a result of better diagnostic measures. Notifications of tuberculosis in young children and adolescents are few, the majority of cases arising in late middle age. It is considered that the spread of tuberculosis is chiefly from the elderly chronic patient. Many cases of tuberculosis are treated at home and where hospital treatment is required there is little if any delay in obtaining admission. i The figures in St. Pancras are somewhat coloured by the fact that there are two Rowton Houses in the borough containing no less than 2,000 individuals, and a proportion of these are suffering from tuberculosis. They are living in relative isolation and not in close daily contact with susceptible children and adolescents. It has been suggested that the mixed population of St. Pancras contributes towards the number of cases of tuberculosis notified during the year. The following table sets out to the best of our knowledge the place of birth of those persons notified as suffering from tuberculosis who came to St. Pancras from other countries. Irish 41 Canadian 1 Greek/Cypriot 17 Swedish 1 W. African 3 Australian 1 Indian 6 French 1 Polish 1 Russian 1 W. Indian 3 Chinese 1 Italian 3 Remainder British It will be seen that they number 80 of the 254 primary notifications. The Council will be aware that there are many who advocate that individuals coming to this country with a view to living here permanently should have a medical examination including a chest X-ray before leaving their country of origin. It is argued that this might prevent entry to this country of persons suffering from tuberculosis or at least secure their immediate treatment on arriving here. This does not necessarily follow. It would be interesting to know how long each of the 80 persons referred to in the above table had lived in England before contracting tuberculosis, for it is possible that a proportion of them developed the disease in this country. During the year no death was recorded as due to childbirth. This is the first occasion when it has been possible to report so happy a return and represents great credit to the work of our hospitals, doctors, midwives and the ante-natal clinics. I would once again call attention to the fact that our Public Health Inspectors paid no less than 37,608 visits. May I repeat, that the Public Health Inspector is not just an official seeking to cause trouble either for tenant or landlord. He is the friend of the tenant who comes to him when he is in trouble, and looks to him for sound advice and help; on the other hand, landlords seek his advice daily as to drainage problems and difficult tenancies. Increasingly do I find doctors and social workers approaching the department for the help of the Public Health Inspector. To-day he must be trained not only in sanitary science and engineering, but in practically every branch of social welfare, from the services available to help an aged person, to advice to a tenant or landlord on questions relating to rent and repairs. He must be an expert on food hygiene and atmospheric pollution and have a sound knowledge of the spread of infectious disease. Above all he must be kindly and human, and patient with the many complaints which he hears every day of the week. Poliomyelitis Dr. Tracy and I have been very concerned with the programme of immunisation against poliomyelitis. It became obvious to us in July, 1957, that the production of British vaccine would be inadequate to immunise the susceptible proportion of the population within a reasonable time and we advised that vaccine should ii be brought from America and Canada In September the Ministry of Health determined to import Canadian and American vaccine, but to test it in England before use. The programme was limited to various age groups and persons exposed to special risk. Once again we protested that this was inadequate. In July, 1958, the "Medical Officer" - a journal for medical men and women in Government and Municipal services, published a letter from us in which we stated that we considered an adequate programme should include a course of three suitably spaced injections for all individuals under the age of 40, expectant mothers and those exposed to special risk, both here and in journeying abroad, We were pleased to see later that the Government's programme had been enlarged to provide three injections for all persons up to the age of 25. We are not entirely happy as to the publicity which is being given to the subject of immunisation against poliomyelitis. In a recent investigation we found that the percentage of expectant mothers immunised is very low. We obtained figures from seven London hospitals and on the 3rd July, of 419 mothers in the maternity departments of these hospitals, only 64 had received either one or two injections against poliomyelitis. We should like to know what steps will be taken to bring home to individuals above school-leaving age and under 25, the advantages of immunisation. When adults contract poliomyelitis they tend to get very severe paralytic attacks and this also applies to persons travelling abroad, where the virus is endemic. We neither of us feel that we should be conscientiously carrying out our duty without a mention in this annual report of our views on this subject. At the same time, we would like to express our appreciation of the support we have received steadily and regularly from the Public Health Committee and the Council, whose resolutions on this subject have been passed to the appropriate Ministry. Slum Clearance During 1957 I represented the following areas:– Model Buildings 12 houses 34 occupants Jamestown Road 14 houses 88 occupants Arlington Road 12 houses 91 occupants At the time of writing this report the position was as follows:- Slum Clearance Programme Area Date of Representation Date Borough Council made order Date order sent to Ministry Date of Enquiry Date of confirmation of order P.H.

Negotiations are proceeding at the present moment with the London County Council concerning this and adjacent areas and I have thought it wise to defer the representation of this area until the position has been clarified. Rent Act 1957 This Act came into force on the 6th July, 1957. Houses in London with a ratable value over £40 p.a. are decontrolled, and the rents of houses remaining in control may be increased to a maximum of 2 1/3 times the gross annual value. Coupled with this there are provisions for dealing with repairs. The standard of repair is such as will secure the remedying of defects having due regard to the age, character and locality of the dwelling. In the first instance, the tenant serves notice on his landlord specifying those defects which he thinks should be remedied. The landlord has six weeks in which to do the work or give an undertaking that the work will be done. If he does neither of these things, the tenant may apply to the local authority for a certificate of disrepair in relation to the defects specified in his notice to the landlord. When the local authority has decided whether any, or all, of these defects justify the issue of a certificate of disrepair they must notify the landlord and allow him three weeks to reconsider the giving of an undertaking. If the landlord does not give such an undertaking, a certificate of disrepair is issued. By the end of 1957, 114 applications for Certificates of Disrepair had been received by the Public Health Department, and dealt with as follows:- Undertakings received 49 Certificates of Disrepair issued 62 Defects remedied 2 No defects 1 23 applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair were received. 13 were granted and 10 refused. Smoke Control At the meeting of the Public Health Committee held on the 4th June, 1957. I represented as a smoke control area a section of Ward 7 bounded as follows:- North Euston Road South Torrington Place and Byng Place East Gordon Square and Gordon Street West Tottenham Court Road iv The Public Health Committee agreed the designation of this area as a smoke control area and its action was confirmed by the Council. Preliminary approval had already been received to the suggested area from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The official representation is now in the hands of the Ministry, whose final approval we are awaiting. The Council will realise that although the actual representation took place in 1958 the bulk of the work was done in 1957. Public Houses There are at present 252 public houses in the Borough. Three of them are unoccupied. Of these three, two are shortly to be demolished, one because of a dangerous structure notice from London County Council and the other because it is within a clearance area. The third is being rebuilt. Of the occupied public houses, one is at present undergoing extensive structural alterations which amount almost to a rebuilding, and another is to be rebuilt in the near future. 56 public houses have restaurants and 10 have buffets. Those public houses with neither, normally serve sandwiches at the bar. Some of the public houses with restaurants also have buffets. These are included in the figure of 10 given above. In 1948-49 a complete survey of all the Public Houses in the borough was made. It was ascertained that some were deficient in sanitary accommodation for the use of customers. In 1948 and in subsequent years, with the co-operation of the brewers, very great improvements were made in this respect, and at present there is hardly a public house in the Borough where there is not suitable and sufficient sanitary accommodation for both sexes. In the three or four cases where there is not a sufficiency of these facilities and where no action is being taken by us, the explanation lies in the fact that owing to limitation of space it is quite impracticable to install additional apartments, or alternatively (as in one case) the public house is within approximately 25ft. of both men's and women's public underground conveniences. Since 1948-49 there has been no routine inspection of any public house, but visits have been made as and when occasion has arisen. This year, however, a routine inspection was carried out and it was found, generally speaking, that little was required in the way of repairs of a structural nature, although some redecorative work to many of the premises was required. The brewers and licencees have been most co-operative with the inspectors in carrying out necessary works. As a result of the inspections, 22 notices and 69 letters requiring work to be done were sent to the brewers. Some of the work has already been executed, some is in progress, and the remainder is expected to be carried out in the near future. The general standard of hygiene in the public houses is satisfactory. In those which have restaurants the kitchens are adequately equipped and well maintained. In all but six cases there is a proper supply of hot and cold water to the bar sinks for the washing of glasses. The hot water supply is not considered satisfactory unless it is a direct supply from a solid fuel boiler or an instantaneous gas or electric heater. Examination of the glasses used by the public did not reveal chipping or lack of cleanliness; 50 per cent. of the licensees use detergents for the washing up of glasses. vii In the inspection of public houses the beer cellar is obviously a place of importance. 25 per cent. of these cellars required cleansing of the walls and ceiling. I do not think that this figure should be regarded as evidence that the cellars were in an unsatisfactory condition. It should be taken merely as an indication that we expect and are able to obtain a very high standard from the brewers. The normal cellar is unceiled; the joists and underside of the timber flooring of the bars above form the ceiling. These surfaces require almost annual cleansing if they are to present anything like a reasonably attractive appearance. In 97 cases, utilisers are used, or spillings are filtered through paper and the beer returned to the casks for sale. Although this Is a big figure (approximately 38 per cent.), it is a considerable reduction over the 1948 figure of 178. In the ten years that have elapsed since the first routine inspection was made 81 public houses which were selling filtered spillings have decided to dispose of them to waste. With one exception the pipelines were found to be above criticism. Of recent years, porcelain and glass tubing has largely been replaced by plastic with glass insertions. Public Health Annexe During the course of the year the Council's Public Health Annexe in St. Pancras Gardens was completed and opened. The history of the site is somewhat interesting. It is believed that originally it was a cemetery and that many persons who died of the Plague in the year 1665 were buried there. Certainly in excavating the site many early coffins were found, and permission had to be obtained from the Home Office for their removal. In 1944 the site contained a war damaged coroner's court, an unusable mortuary keeper's cottage, an out of date mortuary and post mortem room and a cleansing and disinfecting station which were a conversion of old stables. So unsatisfactory was the disinfecting and cleansing station that the council closed it and utilised the war time disinfecting station at Prospect Terrace in its place. In due course the London County Council required the Prospect Terrace area for educational purposes and the Council determined to build an-up-to-date mortuary, and a disinfecting and cleansing station on the Camley Street site. Considerable argument ensued in that it was considered unwise to have a cleansing station, mortuary and post-mortem room on the same site. The buildings, however, are so constructed that the entrances to the two parts are separated by almost a quarter of a mile. In fact, although these two functions are carried out on the same site, neither is aware of the other, and the scheme has been a success. The cost of the building was £72,500, the architect Mr. Thomas Sibthorp. F.R.I.B.A., and the builders F. & H.F. Higgs Ltd. Many members of the Public Health Committee and the Council have now visited the premises which have received unqualified praise. I would assure the Council that this praise is not limited to St. Pancras, and the building is considered as a model. The Public Health activities carried out on the site include disinfection, disinfestation, rodent control, laundry for old persons, the cleansing of adults and children, the treatment of scabies, and some of the work of S.P.A.C A., in particular the Chiropody clinic. A flat is provided for the Public Health Inspector in charge. On the frontispiece of this report will be seen a sketch of the elevation. In the following pages I include plans of the building and various photographs. viii THE PATHOLOGIST'S AND HIS SECRETARY'S ROOM ST. PANCRAS MORTUARY It is difficult to write in an annual report about the work of a mortuary. It is being utilised not only by St. Pancras but also by Islington and Finsbury who pay part of the cost. As from 1st October, 1958, Paddington will also participate. The result will be that the scheme should be most economic. The Committee will realise that there is much secretarial work associated with the work of a pathologist and it is essential that he should be able to dictate his report while he is operating. We have secured this by an inter-com amplifying equipment whereby the Pathologist's secretary can take down full notes without actually being in the post mortem room This system is working extremely well. Smoke Nuisance The nuisance from the Camden Motive Power Depot has continued and there have been various meetings with representatives of the railway authorities. At the time of writing this report attempts are being made to control the nuisance by the use of smokeless fuel. These experiments, although costly, have been carried out in a spirit of co operation and it is hoped that they will bring some immediate relief to the neighbourhood. The present programme is electrification of the railways within 10 to 12 years and partial dieselisation within five. S.P.A.C.A The St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged is composed of members of the various voluntary agencies in the Borough concerned with the care of the aged, and representatives of the Council. It raises funds through private donations and an annual dance. It receives a grant from the Council. The Association was formed in 1949 and has continued to grow in the extent and scope of its activities. It employs four full-time qualified nurses, the rest of the work being carried out through the Chief Officers of the Council, who are honorary officers of the Association, and their staff. Membership of the Association as at 31st December, 1957, was as follows:- President His Worship the Mayor (Councillor Trevor J. Redman, J.P.) Representatives of the Borough Council Alderman Mrs. M.A. Foster Councillors D. Annison Mrs. L.A. Arabin T. Barker Mrs. L. Bartlett Mrs. I.M.C. Bonham Mrs. L. Bryant Mrs. M. Carruthers Mrs. A.E.

Medical Adviser Dr. Dennis Geffen 0.B.E. Hon. Housing Adviser A. W. Davey Esq. A.I.A.S. xiv I have no hesitation in advising the Council that it has worked smoothly and efficiently throughout the year and has brought help, comfort and happiness to a large proportion of the aged persons resident in the Borough, Its help is sought by Members of Parliament, County Councillors, Borough Councillors, Hospital Almoners, Doctors, Clergy and Social Workers. It was originally hoped that the nurses would be able to spend their time in preventive work, i.e. in keeping old people well. In this we have not been entirely successful, for there have been so many calls upon us to deal with special cases, that little time for routine visiting has been available. On the other hand, through the visits of the nurses the doctor and the chiropody clinics, it is probable that between 3,000 and 4,000 persons above retirement age are receiving regular supervision advice and help and this is a reasonable proportion of those whom we would wish to serve, I do not think that the scheme will be complete until we are able to appoint more nurses. Towards the end of the year it became apparent that the Invalid Kitchens of London would no longer be able to supply meals in their homes for house-bound old persons, except insofar as they would carry out their specific function of providing meals for invalids Accordingly, arrangements were made for the provision of meals under an alternative scheme and, at the time of writing this report, S.P.A.C.A. possesses a van of its own and will be able to deliver 60 meals per day The scheme is in its initial stages, but to date is working well. The old person pays l1d per meal, the cost of which is ls l0d and is purchased from the Aerated Bread Company, Ltd The London County Council makes a grant of l0d and the remaining 1d, plus the cost of transport and staff falls upon S.P,A. C.A. I will report in full detail on this scheme in my annual report for 1958. Our nurses paid 8 518 visits Meals supplied through the Invalid Kitchens of London in conjunction with S P.A.C.A. numbered 9.501, whilst 7,353 vouchers were issued, enabling old persons to obtain meals in local restaurants at a reduced cost, 29 wireless sets were supplied and there are now 102 sets out on loan. The chiropody clinic continues to be very popular, The holiday scheme was continued and 139 persons were sent away for a fortnight's holiday in Margate. The letters we received from those who benefitted from these holidays all express their appreciation of the excellent arrangements which were made for them by Mr. and Mrs. Greves. I visited the old people on holiday during the year and can confirm the satisfactory arrangements that are made, I would like to mention the help which old persons in the Borough receive through the Council's library service. They are able to have books brought to them in their own homes The following tables set out comparative figures of the work carried out during the past years:- XV  1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 Number of visits by Health Officers 1,461 2,494 3,776 4,383 6,120 5,662 8,518 Meals supplied to old people in their homes 9,335 9,914 9, 447 9,074 9,396 9,889 9,501 Meal vouchers issued 788 3,498 4,136 6,815 6,703 8,060 7,353 Wireless Sets supplied or re-issued 22 46 34 30 39 26 29 Chiropody No. of Clinics 32 121 198 317 352 413 387 New cases 136 138 215 287 282 237 181 Re-attendances 215 1,198 2,534 3,159 3,866 4,741 4,530 Persons seen by doctor 266 521 509 543 452 389 459 Holidays Persons sent away each year 136 128 134 140 143 129 139 Conclusion Each year it is my pleasure to acknowledge the help I have received from my colleagues in other departments and from my own staff, and I do so most sincerely Once again I would like to pay tribute to the general practitioners who work in the Borough, the doctors and the specialists in the hospitals. Their help has been invaluable. I am deeply grateful to the Public Health Committee and the Council for the courtesy and help I have received. The enthusiasm of the members of the Public Health Committee for all matters associated with public welfare has been quite an inspiration to me and the Public Health staff.
