WAN 81 Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1944, by F. G. CALEY, M.A., M.B., B.Ch., D.P.H., together with the Report of the Public Analyst. Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1944, by F. G. CALEY, M.A., M.B., B.Ch., D.P.H., together with the Report of the Public Analyst. REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1944. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the health of the Borough for the year 1944, together with the Report of the Public Analyst. The number of births shows a further increase over the previous year, and the birth rate has risen from 17.13 to 17.39. The death rate has risen from 14.04 in 1943 to 16.40. There has been no special incidence of disease. The number of deaths from tuberculosis has risen slightly from 193 to 201, and the death rate from this disease is .79 compared with .73 in 1943. The number of children immunised against diphtheria has fallen off during the year, although the attendances at the clinics are still considerably larger than they were before the. war. Owing to the fall in attendances, three of the clinics have been closed, and there are now five clinics open every week. 204 women were admitted to the Council's Maternity Home which was open for eight months of the year. There are now 12 War Time Nurseries in the Borough, and these have been well patronized. 1 am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. G. CALEY, Medical Officer of Health. Erratum Medical Officer of Health's Report for 1944 LIBRARY Please read second paragraph on page 3 commencing "the number of births." as follows:- Although the number of births is fewer than in 1943, the birth rate is higher owing to the fact that the estimated population on which the rate is calculated is lower. 4 STATISTICS. Population 251,510 (1943, 262,160. Census 1931 353,100). Total live births, 4,376. (M. 2,317; F. 2,059). (1943, 4,491). Illegitimate births 241. Still-births 104. Birth-rate 17.39. (1943,17.13). Total deaths, 4,126. (M. 2,008; F. 2,118). (1943, 3,682). Death-rate, 16.40. (1943, 14.04.) There were nine deaths from puerperal causes—equal to a rate of 2.00 per 1,000 live and still births. Deaths of children under one year of age, 176; infantile mortality rate being 40 per 1,000 births (1943, 43). Deaths from Cancer 604 (1943, 595). Measles 1 (1943, 2). Whooping Cough 7 (1943, 5). Tuberculosis 201 (1943, 193). Tuberculosis death-rate .79 (1943, .73). There were no unusual or excessive mortality during the year. STAFF. 19 Sanitary Inspectors have been on duty throughout the year. Mr. A. W. Fisher, one of the Sanitary Inspectors. died in August at the early age of 40 years. He had completed 15 years' service. Efforts were made to fill the vacancy but this had been unsuccessful up to the end of the year. Mr. C. Kitchen, Dispenser for the Tuberculosis Dispensaries, also died suddenly in August, aged 61 years. He had completed 13 years' service. The Public Health Committee decided not to fill the vacancy but to make arrangements for the bacteriological work to be undertaken by the Camberwell Research Laboratories. 5 Owing to the increasing calls on the Maternity and Child Welfare Services, due largely to the return of evacuated mothers and children, it has been necessary to increase the establishment of Health Visitors from 17 to 19. Miss E. E. Chesworth, who had acted in a temporary capacity for the previous six months, was appointed in February and Miss S. Connor and Miss K. M. Evans in August. One of the latter appointments was to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Miss J. E. D. Elder, who has left the Council's service after 16 years' devoted service, to take up an appointment under another local authority. There are now 16 Health Visitors in the Council's Maternity and Child Welfare Service and three in the Tuberculosis Service. All the Grade "A" Clerks, seven in number, and one Grade "D" (female) clerk have joined the Forces. Only four male members of the permanent staff of clerks, all of whom are above military age are left in the Department. There are also two Grade "D" (female) clerks. Twenty temporary clerks were employed in the Department at the end of the year. INFECTIVE DISEASES. There has been a decrease in the amount of infective disease during the year, the number of notifiable diseases (including tuberculosis) having fallen from 4,323 in the previous year to 3,913. Scarlet fever and measles are mainly responsible for this decrease. There were 429 cases of measles reported compared with 2,310 in 1943, and 378 cases of scarlet fever compared with 853. 241 cases of dysentery have been notified compared with 37 in the previous year; 129 of these ocurred among patients in Springfield Hospital, and 59 in Tooting Bec Hospital. There were no deaths. Three cases of typhoid fever were notified. There was one death. There were 13 cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis, with two deaths, compared with 17 and two in the previous year. 1,011 cases of scabies have been notified. 6 1,153 cases of scabies were treated at the Council's Cleansing Station under the supervision of the two bathing attendants. The majority of the cases are now treated by the benzyl benzoate method. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. All these examinations are carried out by the Camberwell Research Laboratories. During the year, 1,021 diphtheria cultures and 959 specimens of sputum were examined. Fourteen cultures for dysentery, one for streptococcus hæmolyticus and one for staphy lococcus aureus were also examined. DISTRICT NURSING The Council has an arrangement with the various Nursing Associations in the Borough, for a nurse to attend patients suffering from certain infectious diseases and minor ailments. 6,226 visits were made during the year. TREATMENT OF SPECIAL DISEASES. 13 persons are receiving treatment for diabetes and one for pernicious anaemia at the Council's expense. The cost during the year was £64 7s. 2d. PREVENTION OF DIPHTHERIA. There has been a reduction in the number of attendances at these Clinics as compared with 1942, when the attendances reached a record. 1,777 persons attended the Borough Coouncil Clinics as compared with 3,134 in the previous year, and 4,209 in 1942. The number of children who attended the Clinics held at the L.C.C. Schools has fallen from 1,698 to 523. At the close of 1942, the Borough Council had five Clinics in operation, six sessions being held every week. Two of these were held concurrently with Infant Welfare Clinics, as it was found to be an encouragement to mothers to have their children immunised at the same time as they were brought to the Infant Welfare Clinics. During 1943, three more Clinics were opened on Infant Welfare Centre premises, and at the end of the year there were eight separate Clinics for the prevention of Diphtheria in operation throughout the Borough, a weekly session being held at each. 7 Early in 1944, it was found necessary to close all but two of these Clinics, but in November the Clinics at Clapham, Streatham and Tooting were re-opened, so that at the end of 1944, five clinics were in operation. The Immunising Agent. The solution now used for routine immunisation is alum precipitated toxoid (A.P.T,.) and two injections of ½ c.c. each are given at monthly intervals. For persons over the age of 15, two injections, each of 1 c.c., of toxoid anti-toxin floccules (T.A.F.) are given. The total number of children immunised during the year was:— At the Borough Council's Clinics 1,767 At L.C.C. Clinics 525 Total 2,292 Vaccination. 2,181 births were notified to the Vaccination Officers during 1943. 1,307 children were vaccinated successfully, and 444 were exempted under declaration of conscientious objection. The percentage of children vaccinated to total births was 59.8 per cent. TUBERCULOSIS. The number of new cases which came to the notice of the Department during the year was 654 compared with 632 in 1943, and 646 in 1942. 592 were pulmonary, and 62 non-pulmonary tuberculosis. 201 deaths were certified as due to diseases of a tuberculous nature, the death-rate being .79. There were eight more deaths from this disease than in 1943, when 193 deaths were recorded. In 1942 the number was 221. The 654 new cases were added to the Notification Register, and 452 who had removed, recovered or died were taken off, the number remaining on the Register at the end of the year being 2,600. The Tuberculosis Dispensary at the Municipal Buildings operated throughout the year. Owing to enemy action the Dispensary at 114 Gosberton Road, Balham, was destroyed and temporary accommodation was obtained at 91 Bedford Hill. During the year 1,732 new cases attended. Of these 346 were diagnosed as suffering from tuberculosis, 274 were suspected cases, and 1,112 were non-tuberculous. 8 Of the 1,732 new cases examined, 347 were contacts, live of whom were found to be suffering from tuberculosis. The number of cases remaining on the Dispensary Register at the end of 1944 was 1,947 compared with 1,827 in 1943. The total attendances at the Dispensaries was 5,200. 609 patients received institutional treatment. 4,202 attendances were made for light and other special treatment, and 1,388 X-ray examinations were made. The cost to the Council v/as £30 1s. Od. and £520 10s. Od. respectively. The number of personal consultations with doctors was 1,087. Home visits made by the Tuberculosis Officers totalled 2.225, and the Health Visitors made 4,208 visits. Artificial pneumo-thorax treatment has been carried out at several hospitals by arrangement. 245 cases were treated and 4,049 refills were administered. Cost £2,090 9s. Od. Nine patients received dental treatment. Cost £42 10s. Od. Extra nourishment as authorised by Section 219 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, has been granted to '23 patients, and 86 cases who were ineligible under the scheme received extra nourishment through the Public Assistance Committee. Cost £21 10s. 4d. Mass Radiography. Arrangements were made with the County Medical Officer of Health for a Mass Radiography Unit to be set up at No. 2 First Aid Post which adjoins the Municipal Buildings. Particulars of the advantages to be gained by having their employees examined by Mass Radiography were circulated to the management of 64 of the larger firms in the Borough engaged in industry and details of the scheme were communicated to the Council's Chief Officers and to the heads of the Civil Defence Services. 18 of the firms intimated that they wished to take advantage of the facilities offered and arrangements were made accordingly. L.C.C. ambulances were placed at the disposal of firms whose works were at some distance from No. 2 First Aid Post. The Unit was installed on the 4th January, and during the 6½ weeks ini which it operated 9,467 persons were examined. In 273 cases the miniature photographs indicated conditions which are not normal and arrangements were made for large films to be taken. It was subsequently ascertained that of this number 94 were shown to have pulmonary lesions. 9 Tuberculosis Care Committee. This Committee, which meets once a month, is constituted of members of the Borough Council, representatives of authorities and organisations interested in the welfare of persons suffering from tuberculosis, and ladies and gentlemen who have a special interest in the work. Activities of the Care Committee. Details- of the home conditions and financial circumstances of patients who are to receive institutional treatment are investigated. The Committee also fix the amounts patients should contribute towards the cost of dental treatment provided by the Borough Council. All persons found to be suffering from tuberculosis are interviewed by the Secretary who is able to give them advice and assistance in many directions. She also pays regular visits to patients who are being nursed at their homes, or in one of the London County Council's general hospitals. 2,135 patients were visited or interviewed during the year. The Committee controls a Fund, maintained by voluntary contributions, from which grants are made to patients who are ineligible for assistance from other organisations. Assistance from the Fund is granted to relatives to enable them to visit patients undergoing treatment in institutions. Patients are also assisted with their removal expenses to better housing accommodation, and with arrears of rent and insurance payments. Clothing is supplied when required, and medical and nursing requisites are lent to those who need them. An amount of £193 11s. ld. was spent in this manner during the year. The Government scheme for assisting tuberculous persons who had to give up remunerative work in order to undertake treatment, came into force in July, 1943. Under this Scheme, financial assistance is only granted to patients suffering from the pulmonary forms of tuberculosis, and is limited to those who have every prospect of returning to work six months after completion of sanatorium treatment. Chronic cases are not eligible. Single men and women who are not entitled to any National Health benefit whilst undergoing treatment in an institution are eligible tor pocket money up to 5/- per week. 142 patients received assistance under the scheme. 10 Handicraft Class. The Committee maintains a Handicraft Class where patients suffering from tuberculosis are taught to make articles which they can sell. The class meets at the Wandsworth Dispensary every Monday afternoon from 2.30 to 4.30 Prior to the outbreak of war, a trained instructress conducted the class, but it has not been possible to obtain her services since, and the class is now conducted under the supervision of the Secretary of the Committee, with assistance from those patients who have become proficient in the work. The crafts taught include the making of articles in leather, embroidery. knitting and the making of gloves. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. Of the 4,376 births which occured during the year, 8,601. or 82.29 per cent were visited by the Health Visitors. The total number of visits made by these officers for all purposes, was 40,576. In addition they attended at Clinics, etc., 'on 3,204 occasions. Of the above births, 77 were premature, 11 having occurred at home and 66 in hospitals. Of those bom at home, all were nursed at home, and all survived at the end of one month. Of those born in Hospitals, four died in the first 24 hours and 12 died at the end of the month, 50 survived and are alive and well. There are 10 Infant Welfare Centres, and nine Antenatal Clinics in operation in the Borough. The number of attendances made at these Clinics was 35,015 and 5,014 respectively. Post-natal attendances were 200. A Dental Clinic is held at the Municipal Buildings for expectant and nursing mothers and children under five years of age. Patients attending the Clinic are required to pay one shilling each time they attend. If dentures are necessary, the patients are assessed on their income in accordance with a scale approved by the Council. 370 patients were seen for the first time, and the number of attendances made at the Clinic by all patients was 1,145. 40 women were granted assistance towards the cost of their dentures, the Council contributing £114 0s. 0d. 11 Maternity and Child Welfare.

Four women received assistance during the year. Contributions are also made towards the charges made by suitable women who assist in the home during confinements. Assistance was granted to 66 cases during 1944. The Council provides a consultant to be at the service of any doctor who desires him to see one of his patients during pregnancy, at a confinement or during the lying-in period. His services were not utilised during the year. An emergency obstetric unit is maintained by the London County Council, and is available to doctors and midwives on request. The object of the service, is to deal with acute obstetric emergencies in connection with maternity cases which could not be moved to hospital without undue risk. The unit was utilised on four occasions during the year. Grants amounting to £76 13s. 1d. were made to the Southwark Diocesan Association towards the maintenance of unmarried mothers in their institutions. Two families were supplied with milk under the Milk (Mothers and Children) Order, 1918. The cost to the Council was 16s. 6d. The Ministry of Food Welfare (Foods) Schemes provide that all children and expectant mothers holding a green ration book, are entitled to receive one pint of liquid milk a day at 2d. a pint. They can also obtain the following vitamin foods:— cod liver oil, orange juice, and vitamin tablets. The latter are for expectant mothers only. The scheme is administered by the Ministry of Food through the local food offices. Six children have been sent to Convalescent Homes at a cost to the Council of £30 11s. Od. 218 children under school age suffering from minor ailments were referred to the London County Council for treatment. The cost to the Borough Council for this service was £37 11s. Od. A clinic for artificial sunlight and massage for children untler five years of age when recommended by the Infant Welfare Centres and hospitals, is held at the Municipal Buildings on Tuesdays and Fridays at 2 p.m. During the year, 97 children were seen at the Clinic, and they made 1,364 attendances. 13 Each Health Visitor has been appointed Infant Life Protection Visitor for her district, and carrie3 out the duties relating to child life protection, under Part XIII of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. At the end of the year there were 11(3 foster-mothers registered with the Council, but only 39 were receiving children, 46 being in their care. MATERNITY HOME. The Council's Maternity Home, which since the outbreak of war. had been used as a First Aid Post, was re-opened for the reception of patients on the 26th August, 1942. Owing to the recommencement of air attack against London, the Home was again closed on 23rd August, 1944, and the staff evacuated to Bolton. 204 women were admitted in 1944. The average duration of stay in the Home was 14.9 days. 154 new cases attended the Ante-natal Clinic, and made 1,652 attendances, and 127 cases attended the Post-natal Clinic and made 128 attendances. WAR TIME NURSERIES. By the end of 1944, the Council had established 12 War Time Day Nurseries, which were authorised to accommodate 602 children. To supplement the provision made by the Borough Council, the London County Council set up Nurseries with accommodation for 86 children at three of their Rest Centres, but these have now been closed. The two Nurseries opened during the year were at 399 Upper Richmond Road, Putney, and 20/32 Summerley Street, Wandsworth. Particulars of War Time Day Nurseries.

SANITARY SUPERVISION OF THE BOROUGH. Inspections made for the purpose of investigating complaints numbered 13,546. The inspection and supervision of the public air raid shelters in the Borough, has been continued, and 971 visits were made for the purpose. In addition 20.576 visits were made to premises which had been damaged by enemy action. The total number of inspections made by the Inspectors for all purposes during the year, was 41,650. 2,926 defects were made. No proceedings at the Police Court were instituted during the; year. 87 visits were made on account of verminous conditions of houses or bedding. '283 inspections of sanitary conveniences were made. 939 complaints of the presence of rats were investigated by the Council's rat catcher, who made 2,300 visits and laid baits The Director of Infestation Control, Ministry of Food, inaugurated an intensive rat campaign towards the end of 1943. and requested all Metropolitan Boroughs to take concerted action, and to carry out treatment of the sewers on two occasions. This was done in December, 1943, and again in January this year. In this Borough, 3,469 baits were laid during the first treatment resulting in the estimated destruction of 28,400 rats. On the second occasion 3,464 baits were laid, when it was estimated that 14,200 rats had been destroyed. MORTUARY AND CREMATORIUM. The Mortuary at Wandsworth was used throughout the year, and 299 bodies were received there. As Medical referees under the Crematorium Regulations, 1930, Dr MacDonnell and I have authorised 420 cremations, which took place at the Crematorium at Putney Vale Cemetery. HOUSING. Work in connection with housing has again been on a reduced scale, but 6,295 dwelling-houses were inspected for defects by the Sanitary Inspectors, the total number of inspections made being 14,535. 1,670 houses were found not in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation, and of thesie 222 were rendered fit without the service of any notice. 15 It was necessary to serve intimation notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in respect of 1,152 houses, and in 304 houses the service of nuisance notices was necessary. OVERCROWDING. 82 dwellings were recorded as overcrowded at the end of the year. Six cases of overcrowding, representing 32 persons: have been abated during the year. The smallness of this number is accounted for by all available accommodation being required for bombed-out families. SUPERVISION OF FOOD. There are four inspectors engaged in the supervision of the food supply. The number of separate food premises is 2,393, and during 1944 thev were inspected on 25,218 occasions. There are 136 registered dairies and 138 persons registered to sell milk from premises other than dairies. The bulk of the milk sold by retail within the Borough is sent out in bottles filled in properly constructed dairies, and its quality is good. 582 samples were submitted for analysis. 574 of these were genuine, with an average fat content of 3.66 per cent. 11 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination and the phosphatase test. All were reported genuine and complying with the standard laid down. 69 licences for the sale of designated milks were granted during the year—34 for Tuberculin Tested milk, 34 for Pasteurised Milk, and one for Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) Milk. There are three slaughterhouses in the Borough, but only one is used at the present. 126 animals were inspected either before or after slaughter. There are now 39 war-time piggeries in the Borough. 192 inspections were made. Since the outbreak of the war, a Wholesale Meat Depot has been established at 666, Garratt Lane, for the reception and distribution of meat slaughtered outside the Borough. This Depot is visited daily by the Food Inspectors, who made 1,145 visits during the year. During these visits quantities of meat were found to be unfit for human consumption. Most of this was the result of decomposition caused by delays in transportation from the places where the animals were slaughtered. After condemnation, the meat was released for industrial purposes. 16. During the year, one application was received from a person desirous of acting as slaughterman. 151 consignments of foodstuffs of all kinds suspected to be unsound, were examined at the request of the owners, and afterwards released for animal feeding. The owners were granted a certificate to this effect. FOOD AND DRUGS ADULTERATION ACT, 1928. 1,852 samples were procured for analysis during the year— 582 samples of milk, 1,123 other foodstuffs, and 147 drugs. 14 samples were found to be adulterated. Eight were samples of milk, three of Seidlitz Powders and one each of gin, browning, and mustard. It was not necessary to take Police Court proceedings in any of the cases. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 and Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. Applications were received from 273 persons for their names to be entered on the Council's Register of sellers of poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. 435 inspections under these Acts were made by the Food Inspectors. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. There were 1,426 factories and workshops on the Register at the end of 1944, and in addition, 131 persons were receiving work to be done in their homes. REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST. Owing to war conditions, only 1,852 samples were submitted, 15 being formal and 1,837 informal. All the formal samples were milk. The samples submitted for analysis consisted of 582 milk, 1,123 other foodstuffs and 147 drugs. Eight of the samples of milk were found to be adulterated. The average composition of the milk analysed during the year was:— Total milk solids, 12.51, milk fat 3.66, non-fatty solids, 8.85. Six samples of other foodstuffs were found to be adulterated, viz.:— Seidlitz Powder E.S., double strength supplied; Seidlitz Powder E.S., B.P. strength supplied; Seidlitz Powder,. E.S. supplied; Gin, 11.6 degrees below legal limit; Browning, a substitute product; Mustard, ground white mustard; two sugar containing 20 and 40 per cent of Epsom salts. 17 Samples of the following substances were analysed:— arrowroot, 3 samples; butter, 101; cake, 2; cereals, 31; cheese, 98; cocooa, 11; coffee, 13; essences, 22; lard, 101: fish, canned or in paste form, 76; flour, 2; food powder, 14; ginger, 5; jam;, 24; margarine, 101; meat products, '14; mustard, 14; pepper, 4; pickles and sauces, 22; rice, 15; salt, 10; spice, 25; soup, canned, 24; sugar, 101; tea, 100: vegetables, canned, 20. The average water content of the 101 samples of butter was 14.9 per cent; that of the 101 samples of margarine, 15 per cent. Seven of the samples were submitted for analysis on the complaint of ratepayers, viz.:— one sample of browning, two of coffee extract, one of flavouring essence, one of gin, one of milk and one of malt extract with cod liver oil. The sample of browning on analysis proved to be a weak aqueous solution of sugar and salt to which had been added a little aniline dye, the latter scarcely dissolved. The article was useless for the purpose for which browning is sold. The sample of gin was found to be diluted with water, but Was free from other addition. In conclusion, I have to report that the adulteration detected during 1944, was 26.6 per cent of the formal samples, 0.54 per cent of the informal samples, and 0.75 per cent of all samples submitted I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, A.
