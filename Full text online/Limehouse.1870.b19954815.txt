Memorials in favor of the proposed Improvement were presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works by the Whitechapel District Board, and the Vestry of St. George’s-in-the-East, and also a Memorial signed by numerous traders and merchants of London Having considered the matter, the Metropolitan Board declined to defray the entire cost (which was estimated at £129,485), but stated their willingness to undertake the improvement upon this Board agreeing to contribute half the cost. Communications were then addressed by this Board to the Vestry of St. George, and to the Whitechapel District Board, requesting them to state whether they are willing to co-operate with this District in contributing half the cost. Replies have been received from those bodies to the effect that they feel themselves unable to contribute towards the cost as a local improvement, as they are of opinion that the whole expense should be borne by the Metropolis as a Metropolitan improvement. 41 The Vestry of St. George and the Whitechapel District Board have been requested to appoint Committees to confer with this Board upon the subject. TRAMWAYS. Notices have been given, and plans deposited, for the construction of certain Tramways, to be called the Commercial Road (East) Tramways, and also others to be called the North Metropolitan Tramways. This matter was referred to the Works and Survey Committee, who determined that it was expedient to oppose the Commercial Road (East) Tramway, it being a single line of tramway, and support the North Metropolitan Tramway, it being a double line of tramway. I accordingly entered into communication with the Engineer to the North Metropolitan Tramways Company, with the Trustees of the Commercial Road, and with the Surveyors of the adj oining districts, through which the tramway would pass, with a view to the insertion in the Bill of such clauses as were necessary for the protection of the roads and traffic, and the rights of the Board. It has been found expedient for the Board to formally consent to the construction of the double line of tramway in the district, but such consent has been given under reservation of, and without prejudice to, the rights of the Board to stipulate for the insertion in the Act, or provisional Order, authorizing such tramways, of all such clauses as they may think necessary for the due protection of the roads and to prevent unnecessary obstruction to the traffic therein, the Company having given to the Board an undertaking in writing that the resolution of the Board should not prejudice or affect their rights. EAST LONDON RAILWAY BILL.
