THE FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT BOARD OF WORKS. Respectfully presented to the Inhabitants. THE Board have the satisfaction to refer to the Annual report of their Medical Officer, and to the Tabular Statements therein contained, as evidence of the improved and improving sanitary condition of the District; and although the proceeding's of the Metropolitan Board of Works in carrying out the new street are very dilatory, yet when the same shall have been constructed, the Board will receive great assistance in their efforts to promote the proper drainage and ventilation of the dwellings of the poorer inhabitants. The delay on the part of the Metropolitan Board has occasioned great injury to the District from so much property having been taken and pulled down, and being as yet wholly unproductive, whereby the rates of the two parishes are necessarily increased. Towards the latter end of the session of Parliament of 1860, a bill was introduced into Parliament by the Metropolitan Board, extremely inimical to the interests of the Board in respect of the proposed re-apportionment of the Rock Loan,—seeking to impose upon the parish of Christ Church a much larger amount of the debt than that at first fixed; and this Board thought it right to oppose the same, and the clause relating to the Rock Loan was struck out, and subsequently the bill was withdrawn. The Metropolitan Board have, however, thought it right to apply to Parliament again, dividing the bill into two bills—the one embracing the contents of the former bill, with the exception of the Rock Loan, and the other being' confined to the Bock Loan; and this District Board has presented a petition against the latter. In the course of the year ending 25th March 1861, the following contracts have been entered into:— With Mr. W. Green, for cleansing Christchurch for three years; from the 1st June, 1860, at the sum of £635 per annum. With Messrs. King and Howe, for Sewer and Drainage Works for the District for three years, from the 16th November, 1860, at 25 per cent. below Schedule prices. With Messrs. Mowlem and Co., for Pavior and Mason's Work for the Borough District, at Schedule prices, for three years, from 25th March, 1861 2 Also, with Messrs. Hearn and Neal for supplying Water Carts for St. Saviour's and Christchurch Districts respectively, from the 25th March to the 25th October, the Board requiring all streets, &c., to be watered when and as often as may be thought necessary. An arrangement has been entered into for letting the lower part of the Clock Tower for the office of the London District Telegraph Company, which it is hoped will be found to be a public accommodation as well as a saving to the ratepayers. The office of Messenger having become vacant by the death of Mr. James Kibblewhite, it was thought unadvisable to appoint a successor, it being considered that the Inspector (who subsequently received an addition of £10 to his annual salary) could perform the duties of that office as well as his own. Many and well-grounded complaints having been made of the slow progress of the new street from High Street to Blackfriars Road, the Board hasten to assure the inhabitants that no opportunity has been lost either by them or their valuable representative at the Metropolitan Board, Mr. Charles Harris, in urging upon that Board the necessity of more prompt action, and a memorial to that effect has been presented to them by this Board. The Board have great pleasure in reporting that the Phoenix Gas Company have voluntarily reduced the price of the lamps in Christ Church, from £4 l5s. to £4 10s., notwithstanding the existing contract, and the alteration will effect an annual saving to the District of £42. On the application of Mr. Train for leave to lay down a Tramway in the Blackfriars Road, and also from London Bridge through the High Street, the Board resolved to give their assent thereto, upon his undertaking to make such Tramway and keep it in repair, and remove it and restore the road to its former condition, if required, giving security to the satisfaction of the Board for that purpose, and also subject to his obtaining the consent of the adjoining Districts and the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Board now beg to refer to the Works performed during the year under the direction of the Surveyor and Clerk of the Works. SURVEYOR'S REPORT. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, April 16, 1861.
