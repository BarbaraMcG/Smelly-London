The numbers of either males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have not shewn any uniform trend during these last ten years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table does however show the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that over the last six years these neoplasms have produced a wastage of life greater than that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 19 SECTION 3.

Notifications During the year 184 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 73 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 22). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1928-1957 are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 24 and 25). Diphtheria It is very gratifying to report that for the seventh year in succession no case of diphtheria was notified. Dysentery Sixteen cases were notified and four were removed to hospital. Enteric Fever Four cases of typhoid fever were notified all of which were removed to hospital. Following notification of one of the above cases, arrangements were made for specimens from the patient's wife and two adult children to be examined. Salmonella typhi were found in the wife's specimens and she too was removed to hospital for treatment. While in hospital it was learned that she had suffered from typhoid fever while abroad about 20 years ago, and, it is reasonable to assume that she had since remained in a carrier state. It says much for the family's standard of personal hygiene that the husband or children had not previously been infected. The wife's condition did not respond to treatment and she was discharged from hospital as an intermittent faecal excreter of typhi bacilli. Prior to admission to hospital she had worked as a food handler, and in consequence, upon her discharge from hospital, notice under the Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations, 1953, was served on her to refrain from engaging in any occupation connected with the preparation or handling of food. The family's housing conditions necessitated the sharing of sanitary accommodation with other families, and in view of the risk involved arrangements were made for the family to be rehoused. The other members of the family were given T.A.B. inoculations. Erysipelas No cases were notified during the year. Food Poisoning Two cases were notified and were removed to hospital. In one case the food suspected was omelette and pork sandwich, but bacteriological examination failed to trace any pathogenic organisms. In the other case the patient was not resident in Holborn. 21 Measles Ninety-nine cases were notified and twelve were removed to hospital. Meningococcal Infection One case was notified and removed to hospital. Ophthalmia Neonatorum No cases were notified during the year. Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal) Four cases of acute primary pneumonia were notified, and one case was removed to hospital. There was no notification of acute influenzal pneumonia. Poliomyelitis Eleven cases were notified, all of which were removed to hospital. None of these cases was a Holborn resident. Puerperal Pyrexia No cases were notified during the year. Scabies One case was notified, and was treated at home. Scarlet Fever Eight cases were notified, and five of them were removed to hospital. Smallpox No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year. On occasion the Medical Officer of Health was called into consultation in respect of suspected cases. A small outbreak of smallpox occurred in another part of London and several contacts of cases there, either lived in or visited Holborn. Appropriate action was taken and there was fortunately no extension of the outbreak. Tuberculosis See page 51. Whooping Cough Six cases were notified, all of which were treated at home.

This work is carried out by the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, 23 Queen Square, W.C.I, and by the Public Health Laboratory Service at County Hall. During the year 58 specimens were submitted for examination with the following results:— Disease Positive Negative Total Diphtheria — 16 16 (Nasal and throat swabs) Dysentery (Faeces) — 14 14 (Faecal swabs) 6 13 19 Food Poisoning (Faeces) 1 7 8 (Other specimens) — 1 | 1 Salmonella typhi (Faecal swabs) 1 3 4 Streptococcus haemolyticus 2 6 8 Vincents organisms 4 7 11 Other pathogenic organisms 7 5 12 Infectious Disease Contacts Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health It was not found necessary to issue any such certificates during the year. International Certificates of Vaccination against Cholera and Smallpox The International Sanitary Regulations adopted by the Fourth World Health Assembly on 25th May, 1951, prescribe inter alia that International Certificates, to be valid, must bear an approved stamp which certifies that the signature of the vaccinator is that of a doctor. During the year 518 certificates of persons travelling abroad were authenticated by the Department. Of these 439 were in respect of smallpox, 55 for cholera, 23 for typhoid, and 1 for yellow fever. Diphtheria Immunisation During the year 202 Holborn children completed immunisation against diphtheria. 24 25 TABLE No. 7 Comparative Figures of Infection Disease for the last 30 years Disease 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 (Population) 39,280 38,380 38,380 34,470 36,440 36,050 36,000 35,400 34,850 34,600 34,350 30,660 23,0 17,160 16,580 17,240 18,020 18,680 21,190 23,460 24,960 25,490 25,930 24,540 23,950 23,710 23,340 23,060 22,640 22,230 Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup) 57 72 80 69 76 75 74 93 60 76 49 19 7 14 17 17 5 11 12 3 2 1 2 - - - - - - - Dysentery 2 2 — 2 1 — 2 6 6 10 10 — - — — 2 13 2 6 — 4 — 2 34 9 8 34 4 7 16 Encephalitis Lethargica — 1 1 — 1 1 1 1 — — — 2 - — — — — 1 — — — — — — — 1 — — — — Enteric Fever 10 5 4 4 4 1 3 2 2 — — 1 1 3 1 6 1 — 1 1 1 — 1 — 2 1 2 — — 4 Erysipelas 23 22 29 17 17 19 12 18 19 10 15 13 12 3 7 3 8 3 4 8 6 5 3 1 2 1 1 1 — — Food Poisoning Notifiable as from 12th July, 1932. 11 5 — — 3 5 2 1 — 1 2 3 1 2 1 4 2 12 1 2 Malaria 1 1 — — 1 1 1 3 2 3 — 1 - | — — 1 — — — — — — 1 1 — 1 1 — — — Measles Notifiable as from 9th Septem ber, 19 38. — 8 39 34 58 219 33 103 107 157 87 170 137 254 133 195 37 172 71 99 Meningococcal Infection 1 — — 4 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 3 7 7 1 1 — 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 10 6 5 7 4 6 6 4 3 3 5 4 4 1 5 4 4 1 4 3 3 3 2 — 2 3 — 1 — — Pneumonia (Acute primary & Acute-influenzal) 59 89 49 40 28 37 38 21 30 34 21 28 14 18 20 22 14 6 17 15 9 9 5 8 4 4 4 3 4 Polio-encephalitis Acute - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - Poliomyelitis Acute — — 1 1 2 - - - - - - - - - - - - -1- -—- -5- 1- 2 2 —- 6 17 3 12 6 11 Puerperal Fever 4 1 3 2 1 3 3 4 2 4 — — 1 2 2 2 2 — 1 1 - - - - - - - - - Puerperal Pyrexia 7 5 6 4 6 5 2 4 3 2 2 3 2 2 7 3 1 4 5 5 2 4 2 3 1 - - - - - Scabies Notifiable as from 1st August, 1 943. 54 99 125 106 43 16 4 3 4 3 6 1 5 5 1 Scarlet Fever 111 130 90 57 57 96 115 50 67 38 59 56 20 16 23 30 20 14 24 29 13 15 16 21 18 10 5 4 4 8 Smallpox 1 43 14 3 1 1 — — — — — — - — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — Tuberculosis Pulmonary 91 76 76 80 73 50 83 68 77 66 71 64 44 47 45 51 41 59 55 47 39 42 39 45 46 48 32 40 33 32 Tuberculosis, Non-Pulmonary 14 12 10 8 16 9 6 5 13 10 8 5 3| 6 8 3 9 9 5 4 8 6 5 — 2 3 4 4 3 — Whooping Cough 104 153 33 44 108 23 65 99 76 60 53 71 7 42 48 38 30 11 43 23 74 5 90 33 32 62 6 1 22 6 495 618 401 342 408 335 412 379 365 322 296 278 161 194 242 456 280 364 392 348 268 269 311 406 261 366 133 258 157 184 "Ceased to be notifiable as from 30th July, 1948. 26 SECTION 4.

Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. Drainage During the year 3,396 inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 97 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 94 Combined Drainage Orders were made. Smoke Abatement During the year 27 complaints were received regarding smoke nuisances and 527 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Public Health Inspectors. 30 Measurement of Deposited Matter and Sulphur Dioxide Since 1953 these forms of pollution have been recorded each month by means of apparatus installed on the roof of the British Museum. The apparatus consists of a deposit gauge for collecting rainwater and deposited matter, and a lead peroxide instrument for recording the amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. The recordings obtained during 1957 were as follows:— Month Rainfall Monthly deposit—Tons per sq. mile Mg. of S03/day collected by 100 sq. cm. of Batch A Pb02 inches pH value Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 1.25 5.6 9.76 10.16 19.92 6.15 February 2.86 5.7 9.13 12.96 22.09 6.24 March 0.95 5.8 14.03 11.61 25.64 4.83 April 0.14 5.7 9.59 6.61 16.20 3.60 May 1.28 6.8 28.40 7.85 36.25 2.87 June 0.90 6.1 8.63 6.14 14.77 2.07 July 3.10 5.8 8.52 13.06 21.58 2.61 Aueust 1.34 6.8 6.88 6.51 13.39 2.29 September 2.23 6.0 8.52 10.10 18.62 2.84 October 1.67 5.1 10.87 16.74 27.61 4.98 November 2.26 6.2 8.25 11.70 19.95 4.17 December 1.56 5.7 8.55 16.70 25.25 6.33 Total 19.54 — 131.13 130.14 261.27 48.98 Monthly Average 1.63 5.9 10.93 10.84 21.77 4.08 The solid matter expressed in tons falling over the area of Holborn month by month was as follows:— Month Insoluble matter Soluble matter Total solids January 6.17 6.43 12.60 February 5.78 8.20 13.98 March 8.88 7.35 16.23 April 6.07 4.18 10.25 May 17.97 4.97 22.94 June 5.46 3.89 9.35 July 5.39 8.26 13.65 August 4.35 4.12 8.47 September 5.39 6.39 11.78 October 6.88 10.59 17.47 November 5.22 7.40 12.62 December 5.41 10.57 15.98 31 Daily Measurement of Suspended Matter During the latter part of 1955 apparatus for making daily estimations of smoke was installed by the Council at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, and at the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene, Queen Square. The apparatus consists mainly of an air pump which draws a known volume of air from outside and passes it through a white filter paper. The amount of smoke collected is estimated by comparing the stain on the paper with a calibrated scale of shades.

During 1957 these observations were particularly useful in checking the behaviour of boiler plant installed in the numerous new buildings which have been erected within the Borough. Most of the new installations are oil fired however and very little trouble from smoke has been experienced. Nevertheless wherever it has been considered possible to reduce smoke, even though no offence has been committed, an investigation has been made and generally an improvement has been secured. Holborn Smoke Control Area No. 1 On the 24th April, 1957, the Council agreed in principle that the whole of the Borough should ultimately become a smoke control area at some future date, and on the 23rd October, 1957, it approved and adopted the recommendations of the Public Health Committee that as the initial stage in achieving this object steps should be taken to create such an area in the south-eastern portion of the Borough. The area to be known as Holborn Smoke Control Area No. 1, is that portion of the Borough enclosed by the boundaries of the City of London and City of Westminster and a line drawn westwards from the City of London boundary at Staple Inn, Holborn, along High Holborn to Kingsway, southwards along Kingsway to Great Queen Street and along the southern side of Great Queen Street to the boundary with the City of Westminster. A preliminary survey was made of the area and details were submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for his observations. In February, 1958, the Minister gave provisional approval to the proposals, and a detailed survey is now in progress. 32 Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 This Act, the Poisons Rules, 1952/58, and the Poisons List Order, 1952/58, regulate the sale of poisons, and every local authority is required to keep a list of persons who are entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. During the year 1957, 34 applications were received for retention on this Council's list. One application was received for entry on the list. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act and the Regulations of 1951, require the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in connection with certain upholstering and filling processes, and require premises used for the manufacture or storage of rag flock to be licensed. Four premises in the Borough are registered under the Act, but no premises are licensed for the manufacture or storage of rag flock. During the year the registration of one set of premises was cancelled following the removal of the firm occupying them. Housing Act, 1957 The following is a summary of action under the above Acts during the year 1957. Slum Clearance Houses included in clearance areas Nil Houses included in clearance areas and demolished Nil Houses repaired as a result of action under Sees. 9 and 10 Nil Houses made the subject of demolition orders Nil Houses demolished as a result of demolition orders Nil Houses made the subject of closing orders Nil Parts of buildings made the subject of closing orders Nil Parts of buildings closed by undertaking Nil Underground rooms made the subject of closing orders 2 Underground rooms closed by undertaking Nil Closing orders determined Nil No. of flats erected by the Council during the year 24 Note: The number of underground rooms which do not comply with the relevant Regulations, but which are occupied for human habitation, is 459. Houses Let in Lodgings Number in Borough 266 Inspections made 64 Overcrowding On the 1st January, 1957, 140 families were known to be living in overcrowded conditions. During the year a further 8 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions. In 7 cases, overcrowding was abated during the year as follows:— Families rehoused by the Holborn Borough Council 2 Families rehoused by the London County Council 3 Accommodation found by other means 2 During the year 35 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors in connection with conditions of overcrowding. In cases where overcrowding is abated, a warning letter is sent to the owner of the premises drawing attention to the relevant provisions of the Housing Act, 1957. 33 Rodent Control Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 This Act lays a duty upon a local authority to see that their district is kept free from rats and mice. It empowers them to carry out inspections and to require owners and occupiers to keep their land and premises free from infestation. Occupiers are required to give notification in writing of infestation by rats or mice to the local authority. Report for 12 months ended 31st March, 1958 The following particulars were supplied to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in accordance with Article 1 (c) of the Conditions of Exchequer Grants to Local Authorities dated 28th July, 1950:— Type of Property Local Authority Dwelling Houses Agricultural All other (including Business and Industrial) Total 1.

There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Acts by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. 36 Burial of the Dead Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. During the year fourteen cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £228 11s. 6d. The total amount recovered during the year in respect of burials was £92 17s. 2d. The cases had come to the notice of the Public Health Department from the following sources:— Coroner's Officer 7 French Hospital 2 Friends or Relatives of Deceased 4 Italian Hospital 1 New Legislation The Housing Act, 1957 This Act which came into force on the 1st September, 1957, repealed and re-enacted in a consolidated form the provisions of the earlier Housing Acts, with the exception of financial provisions, which are to be consolidated in a later enactment. The Rent Act, 1957 This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957. Its main effects are to release a substantial number of houses from the control of the Rent Acts; to provide for the exemption of new tenancies from control; to enable further categories of houses to be decontrolled from time to time by Ministerial Order; to fix new rent limits for statutory tenancies and other tenancies to which the Rent Acts continue to apply; and to provide a procedure for effecting an increase of rent under the Acts. It also provides for a reduction of the rent limit where a dwelling house is in a state of disrepair, and empowers a local authority to issue certificates of disrepair. Public Health Officers (Deputies) Act, 1957 This Act amends s. 115 of the Local Government Act, 1933, and ss.82 and 83 of the London Government Act, 1939. The effect of the amendments is that the consent of the Minister of Health to the appointment by local authorities of deputies of medical officers of health and public health inspectors is no longer required. Public Analysts Regulations, 1957 These Regulations which came into operation on the 27th May, 1957, re-enact substantially the provisions of the Public Analysts Regulations, 1939, as respects the qualifications necessary for persons to be appointed as public analysts, and introduce a revised form of certificate specifying the result of analysis in pursuance of s.92 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. 37 Legal Proceedings Nature of Offence Action Taken Under Result Failure to comply with a Statutory Notice in respect of premises at 5, Orde Hall Street.

Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council. Particulars of inspections and other work carried out during 1957 are as follows:— Number of visits to:— Factories with mechanical power 96 Factories without mechanical power 11 Outworkers' rooms 8 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 117 Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948 The following particulars are furnished in accordance with Section 128 (3) of the principal Act, with respect to matters under Part I and Part VIII:— Part 1 of the Act 1.

Section 111 has the object of preventing such work being carried out in premises which are insanitary or in which infectious disease is present. The following table gives the number and type of such premises in the Borough, and the nature of the work carried out:— Section 110 Section 111 Type of Specified Work No. of Outworkers in August List required by Sect. 110(1)(c) No. of Cases of Default in Sending Lists to the Council No. of Prosecutions for Failure to Supply Lists No. of Instances of Work in Unwholesome Premises Notices served cutions Wearing Apparel— Making, &c 200 — — — — — Cleaning and Washing 3 __ — — — — Household Linen — — — — — — Lace, Lace Curtains and Nets 3 - - - - - Curtains and Furniture Hangings - - - - - - Furniture and Upholstery — — — — — — Electro-plate — — — — — — File Making — — — — — — 40 Type of Specified Work Section 110 Section 111 No. of Outworkers in August List required by Sect. 110 (1) (c) No. of Cases of Default in Sending Lists to the Council No. of Prosecutions for Failure to Supply Lists No. of Instances of work in Unwholesome Premises Notices served Prosecutions Brass and Brass Articles - - - - - - Fur Pulling — — — — — — Iron and Steel Cables and Chains - - - - - - Iron and Steel Anchors and Grapnels __ Cart Gear - - — — — — Locks, Latches and Keys - - — — — — Umbrellas, &c - - — — — — Artificial Flowers 5 - — — — — Nets, other than Wire Nets Tents — - — — — — Sacks — - — — — — Racquet and Tennis Balls — - — — — — Paper Bags — - — — — — The making of Boxes or other Receptacles or parts there of made wholly or partially of Paper - - - - - - Brush Making — - — — — — Pea Picking — - — — — — Feather Sorting — - — — — — Carding, &c., of Buttons, &c. 5 - — — Stuffed Toys — - — — — — Basket Making — - — — — — Chocolates and Sweetmeats — - — — — — Cosaques, Christmas Crackers, Christmas Stockings, &c 57 - - - - - Textile Weaving — - — — — — Lampshades — - — — — — Total 273 - — — — — Firms in the Borough employing outworkers 24 No. of outworkers on lists submitted 273 No. of outworkers referred to other Boroughs 259 No. of outworkers in Holborn employed by Holborn firms 14 No. of outworkers in Holborn employed by firms outside the Borough 51 Total number of outworkers in Holborn 65 Inspection of outworkers' premises 8 Cases of notifiable disease occurring in such premises Nil 41 SECTION 6.

Details of the premises are as follows:— Restaurant 1 Hotel 1 Grocer 1 Licensed premises 2 Other food premises 3 42 The following is a summary of the work carried out during the year as a result of Notices served under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, in respect of food premises: Premises or parts of premises put in sanitary condition 4 Articles and equipment cleansed 11 Articles and equipment put in good order, repair and condition 3 Articles and equipment of non-absorbent materials provided 7 Sanitary conveniences cleansed and put in efficient order 4 Sanitary conveniences made not to communicate with room used for handling open food 1 Persons handling food:— Wash-hand basins provided 2 Hot and cold water provided 3 Soap detergents, nail brushes and towels provided 3 First aid materials provided 2 Washing food and equipment:— Suitable and sufficient sinks provided 1 Hot and cold water provided 1 Sinks and other facilities cleansed and put in good order 3 Ventilation of food rooms improved 1 Food rooms cleansed 21 Food rooms repaired and put in good condition 11 Accumulation of refuse in food room removed 2 Registrations The Milk and Dairies Regulations require every Local Authority to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises which are used as dairies. "Dairy" does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. "Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies. Dairies registered during 1957 Nil Dairies on register at end of 1957 2 Distributors registered during 1957 4 Distributors removed from register during 1957 7 Distributors on register at end of 1957 65 Number of above distributors trading from premises outside Borough 29 Inspections made by Inspectors during 1957 18 Formal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 169 Informal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 5 During 1957, 169 formal and 5 informal samples of milk were taken.

Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area from which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributor holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area. During the year 190 licences were issued, details of which are as follows:— Dealer's Licences Dealer's Supplementary Licences To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 31 26 To sell Pasteurised milk 43 26 To sell Sterilised milk 36 28 Milk—Bacteriological Examination During the year, 86 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. 17 of these were from milk supplied to schools in the Borough and two to a Day Nursery. 45 Registration of Premises used for the Manufacture, Storage or Sale of Ice Cream Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1957, one set of premises was registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, in Holborn, and 116 premises were registered for storage and sale. During the year 3 applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale. Three sets of premises ceased to be used for the storage and sale of ice cream, and were removed from the register. At the end of the year, there was one registration for manufacture, storage and sale, and 116 premises were registered for storage and sale. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, Etc.) Regulations, 1947 During the year, 67 samples of ice cream were submitted for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows:— Grade 1 61 Grade 2 4 Grade 3 1 Grade 4 1 In the case of samples falling within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading. In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. Licensed Premises There are 74 public houses in the Borough, and during the year 93 inspections were carried out. In addition, 38 reports were submitted to the Licensing Justices, in respect of premises where application had been made for the grant, re-grant or transfer of a licence under the Licensing Act, 1953. 46 Food Sampling A total of 492 samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Borough Analyst for chemical analysis during the year. 315 were formal samples and 177 were informal.

Seven new applications for membership were received. At the end of the year there was a membership of ninety with twenty-two applications remaining in respect of premises which had not yet been brought up to standard. A number of ideas were considered by the Guild's Executive Committee as a means of promoting publicity for the Guild, one of which was the printing of complimentary cards for members to distribute to customers, and this was greatly appreciated. A new Guild brochure was published towards the end of the year, members being given copies for distribution to customers and a copy was also sent to each of the nonmember food traders in the Borough. This resulted in several new applications for membership in 1958. The number of large poster sites diminished during the year, but permission was obtained for two new boards to be erected on the site of the Holborn Restaurant and it is hoped that further similar prominent sites will become available during 1958. As in previous years the Borough Council assisted the Guild by means of publicity in the form of posters relating to food hygiene. 51 SECTION 7. Tuberculosis.
