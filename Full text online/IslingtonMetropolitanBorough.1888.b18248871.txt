MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, I submit herewith the statistics of births, deaths and marriages registered in Islington during the year 1888 (which for the purposes of Registration consists of 52 weeks, ending the 29th December, 1888), and also the details of our sanitary work (in accordance with the requirements of the Act of Parliament) for the year ending March 25th, 1889.

This is the smallest birth-rate ever recorded in our Parish, the rate being considerably below that of the three previous years, when the birth-rate was very much falling. I now give in tabular form the birth-rates for the last twenty-one years, with certain statistical details arising therefrom. Table No. III.

MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES In the following table I have arranged according to age the deaths that have taken place in Islington from the year 1884 to 1888, inclusive:— 1884 1885 1886 1887 1888 Under 1 year old 1,506 1,387 1,510 1,549 1,262 From 1 to 2 years 494 525 457 514 438 „ 2 to 3 ,, 201 240 159 235 189 „ 3 to 4 „ 131 127 96 127 109 ,, 4 to 5 „ 88 98 67 105 69 „ 5 to 10 „ 168 177 107 152 119 „ 10 to 15 „ 60 59 58 59 51 „ 15 to 20 „ 85 73 74 73 73 „ 20 to 40 ,, 579 540 555 526 579 ,, 40 to 60 ,, 780 817 791 783 742 ,, 60 to 80 ,, 916 1,020 1,050 1,040 1,011 „ 80 and upwards 221 260 235 237 222 Table No. IV.

The deaths referred to the principal zymotic diseases (exclusive of Diarrhoea) during 1888, viz.:—515 were below those of the previous year, viz., 687; and under the average of the last 20 years, and were, in fact, the lowest on record. Again, no death has occurred in the Parish during the year from Small Pox. The deaths from Measles were less by one-lialf than in the previous year. From Scarlet Fever they were about the same; and from Whooping Cough the deaths were rather less. The number of deaths due to the Respiratory Organs were again less than usual, the fatal cases numbering 1,040, as against 1,169 in 1887, 1,201 in 1886, and 1,197 in 1885; but the deaths from these diseases, unless in very exceptionally severe seasons, more nearly keep pace with the increase in the population, than those caused by other diseases. The fatality from Diarrhoea was 146, being about half the number which occurred in 1887, and considerably below the average of the last eight years. In July, August and September, when the cases were the most fatal, the numbers respectively were 22, 40 and 45 deaths. SMALL-POX. We have again escaped a visitation of Small-pox, not one death having been recorded during the year. I feel it my duty once more to warn the public against the danger of not looking to the only protection which exists, that of a good primary vaccination and revaccination when necessary. 10 MEASLES. Measles was epidemic during the year, more especially in the months of November and December, although, as I have said, the mortality was less by one-half of the previous year, viz.:—151 as against 331 in 1887. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough was the most fatal and severely epidemic of the zymotic diseases, it having occasioned 230 deaths as against 238 in 1887, 205 in 1886, 200 in 1885, and 268 in 1884. The number of deaths in January was 70, in February 51, in March 32, and in April 24, after which the numbers considerably decreased. DIARRH(EA. To Diarrhoea 146 deaths were attributable, as against 291 in 1887, 307 in 1886, 191 in 1885, and 266 in 1884. The deaths during the months of July, August and September were 22, 40 and 45 respectively. FEVER. The deaths referred to Fever generally, amounted to 49 as against 39,48 and 55 in the three previous years. It is often the case, we find, that people who go away for a holiday, return having contracted Fever, instead of having gained health by the change; and this remark applies to the sea-side resorts as well as to the continent. DIPHTHERIA. Diphtheria occasioned 35 deaths, as against 27 in 1887, 54 in 1886, and 138 in 1885. SCARLET FEVER EPIDEMIC. The Scarlet Fever epidemic, about which so much was said at the time, did not last long, 50 deaths only having occurred in the year, as against 50 in the previous year, 25 in 1886, and 29 in 1885.

From the 1st January to the 31st December, 1888, 591 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being 1*6. 299 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £47 2s. 6d. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was about 6*1 per cent, for the whole year. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1888-89. Table No. VI. This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion the amendments effected. In addition, the Inspectors generally have reported the premises from which they have found the removal of dust to be necessary on making their ordinary inspections. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, Carbolic Acid was again used during the summer months in watering some of the streets. Disinfecting Powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway Roads, where these thoroughfares are used as market-places until late on Saturday night. The Dust Bins were also disinfected by the Dustmen after removing the Dust from the houses of the inhabitants during the Summer months. 14 THE SLAUGHTER AND COW-HOUSES IN ISLINGTON, 1888-89. At the Annual Licensing of 1888 there were 76 applications for the renewal of licenses to Slaughter-houses, and the whole of them were granted. For the renewal of licenses to Cow-houses, 33 applications were made and the whole were granted. 76 Slaughter-houses and 33 Cow-houses were therefore licensed. My annual inspection of these places, prior to the licensing, proved them to be in a satisfactory condition. SUMMONSES. During the year ending 25th March, 1889, thirty-seven summonses were issued by direction of the Sanitary Committee. Of this number thirty-one were taken out against the vendors of adulterated Milk, upon certificates given by the Public Analyst. In seventeen of these cases the prosecutions were successful, the penalties imposed ranging from 8s. to £10 ; costs being obtained in each case. Of the remaining fourteen cases, two were dismissed by the Magistrate owing to a technical objection being raised to the Analyst's certificate, eleven summonses being therefore withdrawn. The other summons was dismissed on points of law. Six other summonses were taken out against 3 vendors of adulterated Cocoa, 1 of Pepper, 1 of Rum, and 1 of Butter. In the Rum and Butter cases the prosecution was successful, the former defendant being fined £5 with 2s. costs, and the latter £1 with 2s. costs. Of the 3 Cocoa cases 12s. 6d. only was imposed for costs in one instance, the price of the article being rather low. A second was dismissed on the same ground, but the third was withdrawn owing to a technical objection to the Analyst's certificate, as was also the summons for adulterating Pepper. The total penalties received and paid in to the Vestry during the nine months of the year amounted to £58 8s. 15 DWELLINGS OF THE POOR. Of the 76 houses closed as unfit for human habitation in 1884, by order of the Magistrate, seven in Elliott's Place, Essex Road, only remain shut. Attempts have been made from time to time by repairing, &c., to make these houses habitable, but unless the owner carries out considerable structural alterations, which he appears unwilling to do, it will be impossible to effect any permanent improvement in the sanitary condition of these houses, so as to render them again fit for habitation by any respectable class of persons. This, indeed, is the greatest difficulty in connection with all such properties. I have thought it my duty to report, under Torrens' Act, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, Aston Buildings, Holloway Road, and Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5, Nelson Place, Ronald's Road (a sketch of which I append), to the Vestry, and I sincerely hope that you will order their demolition. 16 I have also reported to the London County Council an area for an improvement- scheme under the Act of 1875, the houses being those within the red lines in the sketch below. 17 REGISTRATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS, OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. (29 & 30 Vic., cap. 90, sec. 35, & 37 & 38 Vic., cap. 89, sec. 47.) The 327 houses which are still upon the register, have been duly visited during the year, under the regulations made with respeet to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1888-89. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated statement (Table No. VII.) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady-day, 1889, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 5,078 received from residents during the year, 3,480 were by Letter or Postal Card, and 1,598 were made personally, or by messages sent to the Vestry Offices. The 5,078 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 12.1 per cent, of the 41,971 assessments in the Parish, as against 22.2 per cent, in 1887. The number of applications received during this year was by far the lowest on record, notwithstanding the increase in the assessments. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C.
