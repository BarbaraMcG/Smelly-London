STE 13 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst FOR THE Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 1912 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST. FOR THE YEAR 1912. To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting to you my twelfth Annual Report, which deals with the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Borough of Stepney for the year 1912. Population, The resident population of the Borough of Stepney estimated to the middle of the year was 277,315; distributed as follows:— Lime house District 53,132 St. George -in -the- East 46,811 Mile End Old Town 110,986 White chapel District 66,386 277,315 I have called attention in previous reports to the question of overcrowding and want of house accommodation. This was at its worst in 1901, when there were hardly any empty houses in the district. A reaction set in, more houses became vacant and it became easier to deal with overcrowding. There was quite a slump in house property which reached its height in 1908, as is seen by the following figures which the Borough Treasurer has supplied me with In the quarter ended March 31st, 1904, the number of empty houses was 1,073. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1906, the number of empty houses was 1,670. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1907, the number of empty houses was 2,865. In the quarter ended March 31st, 1908, the number of empty houses was 2,944. 2 In the quarter ended March 31st,1909, the number of empty houses was 2,729. In the quarter ended March 31st,1910, the number of empty houses was 2,529. In the quarter ended March 31st,1911, the number of empty houses was 2,408. In the quarter ended March 31st,1912, the number of empty houses was 1,847. It is therefore apparent that there has been a distinct improvement in this direction during the last few years. Births.

Notifiable Diseases. 1,733 notifications of Infectious Disease were received, or 359 more than in the previous year. This corresponds to a rate of 6.24 per 1,000 of the population. 1,352 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. 10 369 belonged to the Lime house District, or at the rate of 6.94 per 1,000 ; 250 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 5.34 per 1,000 ; 688 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 6.19 per 1,000 ; 426 belonged to the White chapel District, or at the rate of 6.41 per 1,000. There were, in addition, 2,678 notification certificates received referring to Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Excluding Phthisis, the greatest number of notifiable diseases occurred during the third week in September and second week in October, when 62 cases were notified in each week. In the former period 39 cases of Scarlet Fever and in the latter period 44 cases were included. The number of notifications of Scarlet Fever did not exceed 11a week in the first five months of the year, but it started to increase in the month of June, and it reached its maximum in the second week in October, after which it decreased week by week. The largest number of notifications of Diphtheria was received in the first week in November, when 15 notifications were received, and 13 were received in the second week in June ; in no other week were more than 10 notifications received. Contrary to other years, the maximum number of notifications of Enteric Fever was received in the first week in January, when 5 notifications were received. The disease is usually at its height in the autumn, but 3 cases in the second week October were the most received in that period of the year. The largest number of notifiable diseases occurred during the last week of September in the Limehouse District, the third week of September in St. Georgein-the-East, the second week of October in Mile End, the third week of August and first week of November in the Whitechapel District. Wrong Diagnosis. 45 cases of Infectious Disease were removed to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, which were subsequently returned home in consequence of the patients being found not to be suffering from the diseases stated on the certificates, or any other notifiable diseases. Twenty-six of the cases were notified by private practitioners, 15 from the London Hospital and 4 from other public institutions. This number referred to 23 cases of Scarlet Fever, 18 of Diphtheria and 4 of Enteric Fever.

The Death Rate for the whole Borough was .05 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was .04 per 1,000. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 340 cases were notified during the year, or 132 less than in the previous year, and 329 were removed to Fever Hospitals. 78 belonged to the Lime house District, with 8 deaths, or at the rate of 15 per 1,000 of the population ; 63 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, with 8 deaths, or at the rate of '17 per 1,000 of the population ; 12 106 belonged to Mile End Old Town, with 6 deaths, or at the rate of "05 per 1,000 of the population ; 93 belonged to the White chapel District, with 3 deaths, or at the rate of .04 per 1,000 of the population. The Death Rate throughout the whole Borough was .09 per 1,000 of the population. The Death Rate for the whole of London was .10 per 1,000. Enteric Fever. 51 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year, or 28 less than in the previous year. 9 occurred in the Lime house District, with no deaths; 9 occurred in St. George-in-the-East, with 2 deaths ; 24 occurred in Mile End Old Town, with 7 deaths ; 9 occurred in the White chapel District, with no deaths. The Death Rate throughout the whole Borough was .03 per 1,000 of the population. The Death Rate for the whole of London was .03 per 1, 000. The diminution in the incidence of Enteric Fever has been most marked during the last twelve years, as is seen by the following figures:— In 1901 the number of cases was 245 1902 273 1903 179 1904 183 1905 117 1906 119 1907 107 1908 83 1909 63 1910 111 1911 79 1912 51 Erysipelas. 346 cases were notified, or 128 less than in the previous year. 71 occurred in the Lime house District, with 1 death ; 43 occurred in St. George-in-the-East, with no deaths ; 131 occurred in Mile End Old Town, with 1 death; 101 occurred in the White chapel District, with 2 deaths. 13 Puerperal Fever. 32 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, or 3 more than in the previous year. 5 belonged to the Lime house District, with 1 death; 5 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, with no deaths; 9 belonged to the Mile End Old Town, with 8 deaths; 13 belonged to the Whitechapel District, with 4 deaths. Cerebro-Spinal Fever. 11 cases were notified during the year, 6 having occurred in the Limehouse District, 1 in St. George-in-the-East, 2 in Mile End Old Town and 2 in the Whitechapel District. Two proved fatal. Ophthalmia Neonatorum, 47 cases were notified during the year: 26 belonged to the Limehouse District, 3 to St. George-in-the-East, 11 to Mile End Old Town and 7 to the Whitechapel District. Polio Myelitis. 12 cases were notified: one belonged to the Limehouse District, 3 to St. George-in-the-East, 5 to Mile End Old Town and 3 to the Whitechapel District. Zymotic Diseases. The total deaths from diseases of a Zymotic character numbered 501. It includes deaths from Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever and Diarrhoea. This number is 397 less than in the previous year. 143 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 2.69 per 1,000 of the population. 127 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 2.71 per 1,000 of the population. 156 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 1.40 per 1,000 of the population. 75 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 1.12 per 1,000 of the population. 14 Measles. The number of deaths from Measles was 172, or 119 less than in the previous year. 63 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.18 per 1,000 of the population. 37 belonged to St. George's-in-the-East, or at the rate of .79 per 1,000 of the population. 44 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .39 per 1,000 of the population. 28 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .42 per 1,000 of the population. The death rate for the whole Borough was .62 per 1,000 of the population, whilst that for the whole of London was .40 per 1,000. With the exception of three, all the deaths were those of children under five years of age, and 122, or 70 per cent., were under two years of age. The deaths from Measles have again been high, although less than in the previous year. In spite of improvements, which were noticeable in other directions, there is still a deplorable sacrifice of life upon the altar of this disease. In the last twenty-three years 4,570 deaths have been caused by Measles, or an annual average of nearly 200. In the same period Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria and Typhoid Fever combined have been the cause of 4,524 deaths, or an annual, average of nearly 197 deaths. The number of deaths from Measles in the Borough since 1901 is as follows:— 1901 155 1902 158 1903 162 1904 176 1905 151 1906 171 1907 155 1908 264 1909 236 1910 93 1911 291 1912 172 The following: chart shows the number of Deaths from Measles per 100,000 inhabitants since 1890. Between pages 14-15 15 Unfortunately, the harm done by Measles is not measured alone by the number of deaths from the disease. The disease leaves behind the seed of future trouble. Measles is often a cause of retarded growth and ill-health ; deafness and defects of the eyesight are attributable to it, and it often lights up latent tuberculosis. It is difficult to realise the apathy of the public towards Measles with the undoubted havoc with which the disease visits districts. It is true that under favourable conditions there may be a small percentage of fatal cases, but children with lowered vitality from poor food and insufficient ventilation develop complications which makes their percentage of deaths abnormally high. The risk to life during convalescence and in the late stages of the illness is not appreciated. Parents allow themselves to be lulled into a false sense of security when the first few days of the " fever " have passed, and the child does not appear to have developed any alarming symptoms. Death does not very frequently occur during the eruption stage of the disease except in very young infants, but it cannot be too widely known that BronchoPneumonia is a frequent complication of Measles, and is responsible for the terrible mortality associated with it. It is dangerous to allow a child who is actually suffering from, or who is just getting over, Measles, to play in a cold room. Proper nursing facilities are impossible in this district. If children could be cared for in warm and well-ventilated rooms the progress of the illness could be regarded with equanimity in ordinary circumstances. It is generally agreed that Measles is spread on the largest scale by the attendance at public elementary infant schools of children in the catarrhal stage of the disease. The period during which Measles is actively infectious is comparatively brief, but unfortunately this period is during the pre-eruptive and unrecognisable stage. The occurrence of a similar spread in the boys' and girls' departments of the same schools is prevented by the fact that most of the scholars in these departments are already protected by a previous attack, or that the children as they grow older acquire an increasing degree of immunity to attack, they are more resistant to the disease when attacked. In 1911 Measles was made a notifiable disease in this Borough for a period of six months, but without an extended trial of a general notification of the disease throughout London, it is impossible to express a definite opinion as to the effects of notification. In my opinion, however, the first condition necessary in the administrative control of the spread of Measles is compulsory notification. The notification should be as complete as in Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. There must be close co-operation with the Medical Inspectors of Schools. If a child first attends school, his record with regard to infectious diseases should be entered on a schedule kept for that purpose. When a child attends school suffering from the preliminary catarrh of Measles, twelve days afterwards, the first crop of cases occurs among the children in this class. If the names of all the 16 children who had previously suffered from Measles were known, all the unprotected children attending the class could be excluded from school for a certain period, and a further increase due to a second crop of cases could be prevented. Notification must be accompanied by removal of early cases to fever hospitals particularly those children where there are no means of isolation at home, or where there are other susceptible children in the infected household. By prompt removal of the early cases, the beds at the disposal of the Metropolitan Asylums Board may be found to be sufficient if the epidemic is not of a virulent type. These measures should be supplemented by the more extended appointment of Health Visitors to visit infected households, and see that the regulations for carrying out the remedies for preventing the spread of infection are observed, by efficiently disinfecting the premises, as well as by improved sanitary conditions generally. By these means it may be possible to lengthen the inter-epidemic period, so that more children reach the age of five years without contracting Measles. After that age they are not so susceptible to attack and, if contracted, the disease is only slightly fatal, as I have already stated. School. Room. Period.

For instance, in the Jew's School, Commercial Street, the unprotected children were excluded in Room 12 from May 9th to the Whitsun Holidays and again from June 17th to June 18th ; in Room 8, from June 6th to June 14th and from July 12th to the Summer Holidays. The unprotected children were excluded in 8 other rooms from the beginning of May until the Summer Holidays. In the Old Castle Street School the unprotected children were excluded in Room F from May 22nd to May 31st, and again from November 1st to November 15th. In Room H they were excluded from May 22nd to May 31st and from November 13th to November 22nd. They were also excluded in 3 other rooms. Out of the 76 London County Council Elementary Day Schools and non-provided schools maintained by the County Council in the Borough of Stepney, Measles was so prevalent that the unprotected children had to be excluded during some period or other during the year in 54 schools. Whooping Cough. The number of deaths from Whooping Cough was 90, or 46 more than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death rate of .32 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was .22 per 1,000. 35 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .65 per 1,000 of the population. 16 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of .33 per 1,000 of the population. 35 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .31 per 1,000 of the population. 4 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .06 per 1,000 of the population. Summer Diarrhoea. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea (which includes Epidemic and Zymotic Enteritis, Dysentery, and Dysenteric Diarrhoea) was 178, or 328 less than in the previous year. 156 were under 1 year of age. 32 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .60 per 1,000 of the population. 62 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 1.32 per 1,000 of the population. 22 51 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of .45 per 1,000 of the population. 33 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .49 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole Borough was .63 per 1,000 of the population. Summer Diarrhoea is believed by many to be an infectious disease, caused by a specific micro-organism, and is capable of spreading from the sick to the healthy. By what means this infection is spread during the summer months it is impossible to say, but there is no doubt that milk is an important factor in spreading the infection. Infants artificially fed are more liable to suffer from Diarrhoea than breast-fed infants, and are more likely to die when they have contracted the illness. The number of deaths of infants from Diarrhoea is very low compared to the number in 1911. The Summer and Autumn of 1912 were wet and cold, while those of 1911 were dry and hot. What is it that causes this high infantile mortality? Is it the excessive heat or the dry weather that cause it ? The two do not always run together. It will be seen in the accompanying table of deaths from Diarrhoea in 1911 and 1912 with the meteorological conditions, that the temperature in 1912 did not reach the week's average until the second week in July, and that the number of deaths of infants under one year of age during this week was the same as in the corresponding week in 1911. This was the only week in which the average temperature of the week was higher than in 1911 cxcept the weeks ending October 5th, November 2nd (when the number of deaths was again the same as in 1911), the second week in November, and the third week in November when the deaths exceeded in number those in the corresponding week of 1911. Although the average week's temperature was higher in the second week in July, the week ending October 5th, and the week ending on November 23rd, the total rainfall was also higher in these periods. The reverse was the case in the weeks ending on November 2nd and November 9th, when the rainfall was less in 1912 and the temperature higher than in 1911. 23 DEATHS FROM DIARRHŒA IN THE CORRESPONDING WEEKS IN 1911 & 1912, WITH THE METEROLOGICAL CONDITIONS.

These leaflets were printed in English and Yiddish. They reminded the parents that Diarrhoea was not so prevalent among breast.fed children, and the babies should not, if possible, be weaned during the hot weather. Where the baby is hand-fed the mother was told to keep the milk free from dust, take every care to prevent flies settling on the milk and to destroy all the flies in the house. Instructions were also given with regard to boiling the milk directly it came into the house, and as to the best kind of bottle to be used. About 2,500 leaflets were also given to the Registrars of Births, who kindly promised to distribute them when births were registered. Leaflets on " Kill that Fly " which were supplied by Messrs. Arthur Pearson & Co., were also distributed. Diseases of Respiratory Organs.

The Medical Superintendent reported that the patient was much better in general health, the physical signs in the chest being much less, but there was a considerable area of disease. This appears to have become of a chronic nature and is not interfering with the child's ordinary daily life. Her temperature was steady and she had very little cough. H. S., aged 37, of Selby Street, was admitted to the Fairlight Sanatorium on November 1st, 1911. The Committee considered the report as to his condition on September 26th, but on account of the recent dock strike and other domestic circumstances, he was allowed to remain at the Sanatorium until the end of 1912 when he was taken on as a porter at the Sanatorium. L. C., aged 18, of Terrace Place, Stepney Green, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on December 7th, 1911, and left on April 13th, 1912.

During his stay of 3 months he gained 15 lbs. in weight, weighing 10 st. 21 lbs. when he left, and had improved very much in health. He left the Sanatorium because the only other patient who could speak Yiddish was also leaving. The Medical Superintendent did not recommend it as the disease was not yet arrested, and a further stay would have been advisable. E.

The condition of lungs was very indefinite, occasional moist sounds being heard over the left apex. The report on the progress at the Sanatorium is very good. M. P., aged 21, of Love Lane, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on July 17th and left on October 8th, having gained one stone in weight. Her temperature on discharge was normal. Her walking capacity was 5 to 6 miles, and she was able to do full C work. The apex of her right lung was involved (early). Her progress while at the Sanatorium was excellent. W. C., aged 42, of Maplin Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on July 31st and discharged on September 7th. He suffered from tubercle affecting the apex of the right lung. He made very satisfactory progress during his stay at the Sanatorium, gaining over 18 lbs. in weight. He was able to do Grade III. work, and for the last week or two his temperature was normal except on two occasions, when it touched 99 degrees. The Medical Superintendent did not consider that he was fit to leave when he did, and told him so. E. H., aged 21, of Peabody Buildings, Commercial Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on September 13th, and was discharged on April 5th, 1913. He had advanced disease affecting both lungs. When he left he was doing grade IV. work without rise of temperature. There were still tubercle bacilli in the sputum and crepitations could be heard ; but the Medical Superintendent considered that the disease was not active and that he was fit for work. He gained one stone in weight. L. J., aged 23, of Mile End Road, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on September 13th, and was advised to leave on November 16th, as he was suffering from fits. The fits appeared to be increasing in frequency and severity. There was no sign of active disease in the lungs, the sputum being free from tubercle bacilli. 29 His temperature was generally below 99 degrees, but was distinctly influenced (for about two days) by the occurrence of a fit. His general health was very fair, and he gained 12 lbs. in weight. E. P., aged 20, of Albion Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on September 23rd. The temperature on her discharge was 101 degrees. Both lungs were extensively and acutely involved. She made no progress. The Medical Superintendent was of opinion that as it was a very acute case and unsuitable for Sanatorium, he advised her discharge, which was done on October 18th. R. A., aged 11, of Langdale Mansions, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 12th, 1912 and discharged on April 4th, 1913. She gained 10½ lbs. in weight and her temperature was normal. She made excellent progress, her cough and sputum being much less. On her arrival at the Sanatorium her sputum was crowded with tubercle bacilli, but was quite free prior to her discharge. E. B., aged 31, of Rutland Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 12th, 1912, and discharged on January 3rd, 1913. She gained 12¼ lbs. in weight. Her temperature was normal and her walking and working capacity were normal. The physical signs in both lungs had quite cleared up. She made very good progress. R. D., aged 16, of St. Ann's Road, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 12th, 1912, and discharged on January 3rd, 1913. She gained 13 lbs. in weight, and her temperature was normal. Her walking capacity was good, and her working capacity was fair. There was some stickiness of breath sounds over the second and third intercostal spaces where formerly there were definite crepitations. Her general condition was much improved, and her lungs showed distinct improvement. G. H., aged 47, of Maidman Street, was admitted to Fairlight Sanatorium on October 21st, and was discharged on December 6th. He left at his own request. He was doing Grade III. work with only an occasional rise of temperature to 99 degrees. His weight was quite maintained. E. F., aged 29, of Harford Street, was admitted to Maitland Sanatorium on October 23, 1912, and discharged on January 13th, 1913. She gained 11¼ lbs. in weight. Her walking capacity was 3 to 4 miles. There was slightly prolonged expiration and plus vocal resonance over the right upper lobes as well as crepitations in the second space near the sternum. There was nothing abnormal in the left lung. She made very great improvement in the Sanatorium. 30 Special Report to the Public Health Committee on Tuberculosis occurring in the Borough, with suggestions for a scheme for its prevention. During the year 1912, 2,409 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified— 1,061 being notified in the first half of the year and 1,348 in the latter half. These figures refer to actual cases for which 2,678 notification certificates were received. Of these, 443 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 8.2 per 1,000 of the population ; 397 occurred in St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 8.4 per 1,000 of the population. 729 occurred in Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 6 5 per 1,000 of the population ; 840 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 12.3 per 1,000 of the population. The attack-rate throughout the whole Borough was at the rate of 8.6 per 1,000 of the population. 35 were under 4 years of age, 354 were between 4 and 14, and 88 were between 14 and 16 years of age. Of the 1,061 notified previous to July 1st, 154 were insured when the Insurance Act for Sanatorium benefits, provided for in the National Insurance Act, came into force—117 were males and 37 females. The premises where the patients lived were periodically visited and kept under supervision. When the premises were visited in the first week in October, 198 of those notified before July 1st, were found to be dead, and 255 had left, their addresses being traced in only a few instances. Of the 1,348 notified in the second half of the year 357 were insured—279 males and 78 females. 477 young persons under 16 years of age were notified, and 181 cases occurred in Common Lodging Houses. Excluding the children, the number of insured Consumptive patients was 26 per cent. of the total. Deducting the children and inmates of Common Lodging Houses (who are invariably not insured), the number of insured persons was 29 per cent. of the total number of Consumptives, whereas 33 per cent. of the whole population is estimated to be insured. 31 When the homes of all the patients notified during 1912 were visited early in January, 1913, 312 were dead and 581 had left, and only in a few instances could they be traced. Table showing the class of practice in which the cases occurred:— Private. Hospital and Dispensary. Poor Law. Totals.

The Stepney Tuberculosis Dispensary was started in 1911. A Provisional Committee was formed, and it was decided to establish a Dispensary on the lines laid down by the Central Fund for the Promotion of the Dispensary System for the Prevention of Consumption in London. The Central Fund promised a substantial subsidy. In view of the large area and population of the Borough of Stepney, and the importance of the District selected for dispensary administration being thoroughly covered, it was decided to limit operations at first, to the eastern half of the Borough. The Dispensary was opened on May 15th, 1911, in temporary premises at 4, Arbour Square. Two more Dispensaries were opened in the Borough on July 1st, 1912, one being situated at 208, High Street, Shadwell, and the other at 18, Great Prescot Street, Whitechapel. The aims and objects of such an institution are manifold. To quote from the Interim Report of the Departmental Committee, the functions of the Tuberculosis Dispensary should be:— (1) Receiving house and centre of diagnosis. (2) Clearing house and centre of observation. (3) Centre for curative treatment. (4) Centre for examination of contacts. (5) Centre for "after care." (6) Information bureau and educational centre. It will be noted that the work of the Dispensary includes not only clinical, but also preventive and administrative work. 32 It is intended to be in close touch with the various means available in the locality for the treatment and isolation of patients, and to be the centre of all efforts directed towards the prevention and cure of the disease. By means of an organisation of this kind, we are enabled to penetrate further and attack the disease at its root. The Dispensary is organised in such a manner that the disease is dealt with in the homes of the people. It is there that infection usually takes place, consequently, it is there that the first and greatest effort against the disease must be directed. Patients are seen at the Dispensary, where they are examined. A record is taken of their condition, history, &c., after which they are treated at the Dispensary, or are recommended for Sanatoria if suitable, or for Convalescent Homes and Infirmaries, if necessary. The Dispensary Nurse visits the homes of the patients with a view of persuading them to adopt the best methods available in their homes, to minimise the risk of infection to others, and to arrange for a systematic examination of "contacts," and inquire as to any cases which may have occurred prior to the visit of the patient to the Dispensary. Many patients are discovered in the curable or merely suspicious stage, who might otherwise progress to the incurable stage before a diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis is established, or even before the patient realised that anything serious is the matter. It is only in this manner that we can hope to make a successful fight against the malady, we must not wait until the infected members of a family present themselves for treatment. It is then often too late. We must follow the patients to their homes and search for the disease. It is interesting to note that in the examination of contacts, advanced cases are discovered, which have perhaps been the original source of infection, but advice has never been sought, with the result that ignorance has caused the onset of the disease in other members of the family Many of the "contact" cases require little more than instruction in the healing and recuperative properties of the open air. Some require more active measures, and these are treated at the Dispensary by Tuberculin or other means, or are sent to Sanatoria. The injection of Tuberculin was given to nearly 40 per cent. of the consumptives treated at the Dispensaries during the year. The advanced and dangerous cases are, as far as possible, sent to the Infirmaries, but when this cannot be done or is unnecessary, such cases were treated at home, effort being directed towards the prevention of infection. 33 The Dispensary also plays an important part in the after-care of consumptives on discharge from Sanatoria, Hospital, &c. This is perhaps the most difficult problem of all, including as it does, the question of employment. Some special provision is needed for the purpose of finding suitable work for consumptives. In the early days of the Dispensary Committee's work, the late Mayor of Stepney (Alderman H. Potter) made a generous proposal to assist the scheme by raising a Memorial Fund to King Edward VII. This effort was heartily welcomed by the Committee and it resulted in a fund amounting to over £900, which was divided in equal shares to furnish and equip the three Dispensaries that had been opened. From May 15th to December 31st, 1911, 671 new patients presented themselves for examination at the Stepney Dispensary. Number of cases at the Dispensaries in 1912:— Stepney Dispensary. Whitechapel , Dispensary. St. George's Dispensary. Total. No. of cases examined in 1912 1,233 1,183 654 3,070 No. of cases treated in 1912 715 833 451 1,999 No. of insured persons treated in 1912 60 173 178 411 No. of notifications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis received 264 400 118 782 Many of these notifications were duplicates, the patients having previously been notified by other doctors. It must be remembered that the figures for the Stepney Dispensary are for the whole year while those for the other two Dispensaries are for six months only. As the work increased it became necessary to appoint an Assistant Medical Officer at the Stepney Dispensary, and one was appointed in July, 1912. The Committee decided recently to give an opportunity to qualified medical men to gain experience in Tuberculosis Dispensary work, and for that purpose an unpaid Clinical Assistant has been appointed in each Dispensary. 25 per cent. of the consumptives notified by Dispensary doctors were discovered as the result of the examination of contacts. That is, the members of the families of consumptives were examined, and one out of every four was found to be suffering from consumption, although the infected person had not actually complained and had not been medically attended, c 34 From January 1st, 1913, to February 20th, I received 468 notifications of Tuberculous diseases, 90 were received from the three Dispensaries, the number in February being 8 from the Dispensaries and 332 from other practitioners. Even with the 3 Dispensaries in full working order, they do not deal with all the cases of Tuberculosis occurring in the Borough. The average annual cost of the three Dispensaries:— Stepney Dispensary. Whitechapel Dispensary. St. George's Dispensary. £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d. Rent 32 0 0 70 0 0 50 0 0 Rates 11 5 4 28 15 0 18 8 0 Gas, Electricity, &c. 15 2 9 4 19 6 3 5 4 Water 0 13 0 1 14 6 1 7 6 £59 1 1 £105 9 0 £72 13 6 Salaries:— £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d.

Sanatorium Benefits. Sanatorium benefits under the National Insurance Act came into operation on July 15th, 1912, and a Sub-Committee was appointed for the Borough by the London Insurance Committee. The Sub-Committee made arrangements for the Domiciliary and Dispensary treatment of insured persons. Treatment at a Sanatorium was arranged for by the London Insurance Committee. Before insured persons could receive any of the Sanatorium benefits, they were obliged to go to Fitzroy Square, W., for examination by a Physician appointed by the Insurance Committee. Of the 357 insured persons notified to me to be suffering from Pulmonary Consumption from July 1st to the end of the year, 46 only took this trouble ; 14 were recommended for Domiciliary or Dispensary treatment, 23 for treatment in a Sanatorium, of whom 12 were admitted before December 31st, the remaining 11 35 receiving Domiciliary treatment until arrangements could be made for their treat ment at a Sanatorium; 9 were recommended to be admitted as in-patients of Hospitals, 5 being admitted before the end of the year. The total number of Stepney residents admitted to Sanatoria up to date is 35. I understand these arrangements were only meant to be of a temporary nature. They were certainly unsatisfactory, and it is hoped that the permanent arrangements will be of a more efficient character. The fact that nearly 90 per cent. of the insured persons, who were considered to be consumptive by their own medical attendant did not apply for Sanatorium benefits is unsatisfactory. It must be remembered that unless they applied and were examined by the Insurance Committee's Medical Referee, the doctors did not receive payment for the Domiciliary treatment agreed to by that Committee. The Dispensaries suffered a similar loss. (The financial arrangements for the Domiciliary treatment of consumptives by medical men have since been altered). The objections given by the insured persons were in my opinion reasonable:— (1) They would lose a day's work to go to the West End to be examined, as no arrangements were made for an evening examination. (2) They were obliged to produce their Insurance Card. In a large number of instances these cards were kept by the employer. If an insured person made an application for the card, suspicion was aroused. If the reason for the application was given, the insured person might be dismissed, as some employers object to a consumptive patient as an employee. If the reason be withheld, the employee might be suspected, and the employer may have the impression that another situation is looked for. In any case the result is equally unpleasant and occasionally disastrous to the employee. (3) The insured person was too ill to leave his bed or his room. These objections were brought to the notice of the London Insurance Committee by the Stepney Sanatorium Sub-Committee, and with respect to the last objection, the Committee waived the necessary examination by their Medical Referee on the patient producing a medical certificate that he was too ill to attend. These objections can be obviated by the appointment of a Tuberculosis Officer in each Metropolitan Borough, and as medical benefits have come into operation, the red ticket for medical attendance may be utilised. The production of this ticket may be made a sufficient guarantee of the identity of the patient. Scheme for the Treatment of Tuberculosis. A comprehensive scheme for the treatment of Tuberculosis should consist of two parts (1) Institutional treatment. (2) Non-institutional treatment. c 2 36 (1) Institutional Treatment. This should include treatment in sanatoria, hospitals, homes for the advanced cases, and homes for the dying. It is very necessary, especially in a Borough containing such a large number of poor inhabitants, that provision should be made for advanced cases to be properly segregated. Institutional treatment is to be provided by the London County Council. (2) Non-institutional Treatment. Non-institutional treatment should be organised as follows:— 1. Notification of all cases of Tuberculosis. After February 1st, 1913, all Tuberculous diseases became notifiable. 2. The establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary or Dispensaries. 3. The provision of a few observation beds in connection with one of the Dispensaries. 4. Retention of beds at Sanatoria for non-insured persons. 5. Examination of Contacts. 6. Bacteriological examination of sputum of persons suspected to be suffering from consumption. The sputum of Dispensary patients are examined at the Dispensary, and of other persons at the Borough Council's Laboratory. Opportunities are given to general practitioners to examine the sputum of their patients at the Council's Laboratory. 7. The examination of school children and in connection therewith the provision of open-air schools and the recommendation of children for such schools. (The London County Council have established such schools in other parts of London.) 8. Disinfection of premises after death or removal. 9. Nursing of advanced cases. 10. The supply of shelters, beds and bedding. 11. The conditions under which the patient lives should be considered, and housing accommodation should be continually improved. Educating the general public by means of lectures on the prevention of consumption should be encouraged, and the issue of printed general instructions as to the prevention of the spread of the disease, &c., by Health Visitors should be continued. The organisation of schemes should be undertaken as part of the Public Health Administration of the area to which they relate, and the Medical Officer of Health should be the Chief Executive and Organising Officer. 37 The Local Government Board point out, and emphasise the fact, that it is the duty of the Medical Officer of Health, upon receipt of a notification under the Tuberculosis Regulations, either himself or through an Officer acting under his instructions, to make such inquiries and take such steps as may appear to him necessary or desirable for preventing the spread of infection, and for removing conditions favourable to infection. These inquiries will necessarily include investigations into sources of infection, search for contacts, and inquiry into housing conditions. The Assistant Medical Officer of Health when not engaged in the Bacteriological Laboratory is thus occupied in visiting the homes of patients notified by doctors other than Dispensary Medical Officers, but he has not time to examine contacts. Subsequent visits are made by the Sanitary Inspectors. The Departmental Committee expressed the opinion that one Dispensary would probably be required for every 150,000 to 200,000 of the population, but add that "much will, however, depend upon the character of the neighbourhood." To effectually fulfil all the functions of a Dispensary it is advisable for it to be in as central a position as possible. In the Dispensary it will be necessary to have the following accommodation:— General waiting room, consulting room, dressing room, dispensary, and rooms for caretaker. I. Staff.—(a) The staff will include a whole-time Tuberculosis Officer, who will have charge of the Dispensary and who will act as expert adviser to the District Insurance Committee in regard to diagnosis and treatment of Tuberculosis of insured persons. It will also be necessary to appoint in Stepney at least one Assistant Tuberculosis Officer. They should be Officers of the Public Health Department and under the administrative control of tne Medical Officer of Health. Tnis is necessary, as otherwise they could not act under the Orders of the Local Government Board with regard to the steps to be taken for preventing the spread of infection, or for removal of conditions favourable to infection. These officers will not, in ordinary cases, undertake any domiciliary treatment except in emergencies, but will be available as consultants in these cases. With reference to the duties of these officers, Article 17 of Memo. 112 of the Insurance Commissioners, is as follows:— "When the scheme is in full operation, persons, whether insured or not, "who are suspected to be suffering from Tuberculosis should be examined "by the Tuberculosis Officer or officers of the Dispensary, who should re"commend the kind of treatment most suitable for each. The Tuberculosis "Officer and his assistants could thus act as the medical advisers of the In"surancc Committee in carrying out his duty of deciding which insured persons 38 " should receive sanatorium benefit and what kind of treatment should be " provided for each. In those cases which can best be treated at the Dispensary " itself, the medical staff will give the necessary treatment. Where the case " is treated at home under the care of a private practitioner, the Tuberculosis " Officer will act as a consultant, and, with the Dispensary staff, will assist " the practitioner in such way as may be necessary." " When patients return home after a period of treatment in a residential " institution, prolonged care and medical supervision may frequently be re" quired, and it will be the duty of the Dispensary Staff to co-operate with the " private practitioners in carrying this out. The Dispensary Staff will also act " under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health in carrying out any duties " that are necessary for his assistance in administrative and preventive work " for the protection of Public Health, such as the examination of ' contacts,' " i.e., persons who have been associated with tuberculous persons, and may " therefore be themselves infected." A certain proportion of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in insured persons will doubtless be treated at home by medical practitioners, and the linking up of the Dispensary and home treatment of insured persons should be carried out on the lines laid down in Article 2 of the Local Government Board's Order of the 26th July, 1912, and contacts of insured consumptives, with the consent of the practitioner in attendance, will be examined by the Medical Officer at the Dispensary. The work of the Dispensary, in addition to treatment, would be diagnostic, consultative, bacteriological and statistical ; treatment at the Dispensary would be provided for all cases in which such treatment is recommended by the Tuberculosis Officer. The Dispensary will also be available for the attendance of medical men for instructions in special treatment. (b) Health Visitors.—The Health Visitor's visits are made in accordance with the Dispensary programme for the purpose :— (1) Of seeing that the doctor's instructions to the patient are being properly carried out ; (2) Of advising the patients and friends with regard to improvements of the hygienic conditions of the homes. From time to time, depending on the individual case, the Health Visitor revisits the home, endeavouring by tact and sympathy to gain the confidence of the patient and friends. She advises the " contacts " to attend at the Dispensary for examination, but if for some reason it is difficult for them to attend she arranges for their examination at home. 39 (c) Nurse.—A nurse is necessary to be in attendance at the Dispensary. (d) A Clerk-Dispenser. (e) A Caretaker, who will also act as Porter. Non-insured persons will usually be referred to the Dispensary by their own doctor, or by the Medical Officer of Health. The procedure in regard to insured persons will be in accordance with the arrangements made with the Insurance Committee. II. It would be an advantage for a few observation beds to be available for use in connection with the Dispensary. III. Arrangements can be made with the East London Nursing Society for the nursing of advanced cases at their own homes—patients too far advanced to be taken into Sanatoria or Hospitals. IV. Shelters and other articles which could be suitably used by the patient in his own home should be lent for the use of patients when required. V. Examination of School Children.—The medical examination of school children resolves itself into two classes—the " periodical " and the " occasional." By the " periodical " inspection, all the children are systematically examined at certain ages, and by the " occasional " examination, selected children are brought to the notice of the Medical Inspector for suspected defects or diseases. Under the Regulations of the Board of Education there are two groups of children who must be medically inspected by every Education Authority, viz.:— the " entrants " and " leavers." In other words, every child in his fifth and thirteenth year is medically examined, and these " entrants " and " leavers " constitute the periodical examination. Different authorities have extended the scope of the periodical examination, and in some districts all the children are also examined in their eighth and eleventh year. As far as we are at present concerned, I believe that an extension of the occasional examination is of more importance. The services of the teachers could be utilised, and the children who exhibit any symptons of malnutrition could be kept under observation and brought to the notice of the Medical Inspector. The examination of children suspected to be suffering from Tuberculosis could be made at the Dispensary. During the year 1912, the number of children notified to be suffering from Tuberculosis of the Lungs by School Medical Officers was 15. 40 From October 22nd to the end of December, a medical man, who was a School Manager, examined about 300 school children—chiefly at the school—and referred about 90 to the Tuberculosis Officers for confirmation. These officers confirmed his diagnosis of the presence of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in 45 cases, as well as 11 children who were not at the time attending school, but were contacts of the school children in question. Without expressing an opinion whether the general practitioner referred to exceeded his duty as a School Manager, these facts show the necessity of a further examination of school children, when they appear to be obviously in bad health or of a low physical standard. The medical examinations of school children by the School Medical Officers of the London County Council take place during the first year of school life, and also at the following periods, viz., when the child is between eight and nine years of age, between eleven and twelve years of age, and also, on request, when the child leaves the school. The children can, however, be examined at any period by request of the teachers, if the latter think that the children are in bad health. I have arranged to send to Dr. Menzies (the School Medical Officer in charge of the Eastern Division) a weekly list of all school children from four to fourteen years of age notified to me to be suffering from Phthisis, together with the names of the schools they attend. The other children in the family can then be examined by the School Medical Officers. The latter will be able to keep the phthisical children under observation, and probably arrange for playground classes or open-air schools for their benefit. Special arrangements can also be made for their feeding. The School After-care Committee would be in a position, not only to advise the parents what occupations to avoid for these children, but also to recommend the occupations which would be most suitable to their condition. Personally, I do not see why arrangements cannot be made for a portion of Victoria Park, as well as gardens in connection with private houses, to be utilised for open-air schools for the benefit of tuberculous children, with special departments for those with suspicious symptons only. I admit that it would be an additional expense and cause an increase to the Education rate, which is already a high one. Fifteen children between five and fifteen years of age, and thirtysix young people between fifteen and twenty-five years of age died in the Borough of Stepney in 1912 from Consumption, in addition to twenty-three between five and twenty-five years of age who died from Tuberculous diseases other than Consumption. None of these were able to return to the community anything proportionate to that which, in actual money, was spent upon them. VI. Care Committee.—The organisation of a voluntary committee for :— (a) The assistance of patients needing extra nourishment or for aiding the family during the enforced absence of the bread-winner. 41 (b) The care of The patient after his return from a sanatorium. In many cases, if the patient returns to his former employment and surroundings, he soon has a relapse, and the good influence of the sanatorium treatment is undone. (c) Providing an extra bedroom for the use of the very poor consumptives, who live and sleep in the same room with the rest of the family. These matters can only be undertaken by a Voluntary Committee, as money from the State is not available for the purpose. The Tuberculosis Dispensary of the Council.—There are three ways in which the Borough Council can arrange for the treatment of Tuberculosis by means of the Tuberculosis Dispensary. (1) The sole management and control to be by the Borough Council. A charge could be made to the Insurance Committee for the treatment of insured persons. The deficit would be ma.de up equally from the rates and a grant from the Government. (2) The management and control to be by a joint committee, called a Consultative Committee, composed of members of the Borough Council and the Voluntary Committee. In this case, the appointment of the Staff and the internal management would be by the Consultative Committee. There would be a subsidy from the Insurance Committee as in No. 1, and after deducting this amount, as well as the amount of the grant from the Voluntary Association, the deficit would have to be made up in equal proportions from the rates and from the Government. (3) The management and control to be as formerly, by the Voluntary Committee, together with a representative or two from the Borough Council, provided the Borough Council assisted the Voluntary Committee financially by a small grant annually from the rates. This grant is suggested so that the Medical Officers and other members of the Staff of the Dispensaries can be appointed nominally as officers of the Public Health Department, and, as such, have power to enter the homes of the people and examine contacts, &c., as representatives of the Medical Officer of Health, as in Nos. 1 and 2. At the request of the Public Health Committee I beg to submit an estimate of the cost of maintaining the present three Dispensaries:— (1) If they are taken over by the Borough Council; 42 (2) If they arc transferred to a Consultative Committee and are partly under the control of the Voluntary Committee and of the Borough Council ; (3) If they remain under the control of the Voluntary Committee, without the supervision or management of the Borough Council ; (4) If satisfactory arrangements cannot be made with the Voluntary Committee, an estimate of the cost of establishing and maintaining a central institution as a fourth alternative :— Scheme No. 1.—(Entirely under the Borough Council's control and management) :— Total cost if the three Dispensaries are continued on the present basis £3,000 to £4,000 per annum. Contribution from National Insurance Fund £1,000 Deficit from £2,000 to £3,000 Contribution by Local Government Board —one-half from £1,000 to £1,500 Balance, which will be made up from the rates £1,000 to £1,500 Scheme No. 2.—(Under control of Consultative Committee, composed of representatives of Borough Council and of Voluntary Committee) :—Deficit as above, between £2,000 and £3,000. From this the amount of the grant from the Central Fund would have to be deducted, and half of the balance would then be contributed by the Local Government Board and remainder from the rates. The amount of the deficiency will depend on the grant from the Central Fund. Scheme No. 3.—(Under entire control of Voluntary Committee) :— The initial annual charge on the rates would be nominal, but if subscriptions are insufficient, the deficit would be borne equally by the rates and by the Treasury. Scheme No. 4.—(To establish a Council Tuberculosis Dispensary) :— Establishment.—Furnishing and fitting up rooms—tables, chairs, linoleum, gas or electric light fittings, laboratory bench and sink £40 Apparatus, including microscope, weighing machine, laryngoscope, clinical thermometers, steriliser, hyperdermic syringes, centrifuge, incubator and other bacteriological apparatus £80 £120 43 If the Dispensary is situated in the neighbourhood of the Public Health Offices, the latter sum would be less than ore-half, as the bacteriological examinations could be undertaken at the Laboratory, at 43, White Horse Street. Maintenance:— Salaries :— Medical Officer £400 to £500 Assistant Tuberculosis Officers 300 to 400 Nurse 100 to 130 Two Health Visitors 200 to 260 Caretaker, also acting as Porter (house, gas and coals provided) 50 One Clerk-Dispenser 100 Rent 50 Rates, Taxes, Water, &c 25 Coals and gas 10 Drugs, including Tuberculin 150 £1,385 to £1,675 Finance:— Establishment.—For the establishment of Dispensaries, capital grants will be distributed by the Local Government Board to the extent of four-fifths of the amount required. The Departmental Committee suggested that this sum should not exceed £1 per 750 population, which, in the Borough of Stepney, would be £370. Maintenance.-—As to the financial assistance from the Insurance Funds towards the maintenance of a Dispensary, no precise statement can be made at the present time. It will be subject to arrangements between the County Insurance Committee and the Borough Council, with the approval of the Insurance Commissioners. A sum of 9d. per annum per insured person is now available under the National Insurance Act for Sanatorium Benefits, as 6d. out of the Is. 3d. specified in the Act has been allocated for the payment of doctors in respect of the domiciliary treatment of insured persons suffering from Tuberculosis. It is impossible to say how much of this 9d. will be ear-marked for Dispensaries. It is estimated by the London Insurance Committee that there are in the Borough of Stepney 93,000 insured persons, and 9d. per person would therefore produce £3,487 per annum. Deducting a possible £1,000 a year for the Dispensaries, there would be sufficient money left to the County Committee to retain thirty-one beds at Sanatoria for the benefit of insured persons living in the Borough of Stepney. As 23 insured persons only applied for and were recommended for Sanatoria from October 1st to December 31st last this sum may be sufficient for the purpose. 44 After deducting the sum received for the Dispensary treatment of insured persons, the deficiency will be met by the Exchequer and the Local Authority in equal proportions. Allowing £1,000 a year as an estimate of the sum to be received from the Insurance Committee, this will leave frcm £385 to £675 as a deficiency, and the amount to be made up from the rates would be therefore from £190 to £337 10s Od. a year. The Stepney Borough Council have retained 10 beds at Sanatoria until the end of March at an estimated cost of £650 per annum. Taking into consideration the fact that the Insurance Committee will provide Sanatoria beds for insured persons, it would not be necessary for the Council to provide more than four beds for non-insured persons—two males and two females— at an annual cost of £312. The sum estimated to be required, including the provision of beds at Sanatoria, will be about the same amount as now expended in retaining beds alone. I believe the suggested contribution from the rates will be sufficient, at any rate, until the whole facts are ascertained, and the total number of consumptives discovered through the examination of contacts. I have made enquiries in several quarters as to the probable amount which will be received for the treatment of insured persons, but I have failed to receive any satisfactory reply. The sum suggested is, in my opinion, the maximum that will be received for the treatment of insured persons, whereas the sum estimated for the expenditure is the minimum on which the Dispensary treatment can be performed if there is no voluntary agency undertaking similar work in the Borough. If the work is found to be more than the suggested staff is able to undertake efficiently, one or more Assistant Medical Officers may be appointed, or a Branch Dispensary started in another part of the Borough. If a Branch Dispensary is decided on, premises may be taken for that purpose, or arrangements made with the London Hospital Authorities. REPORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE TO THE COUNCIL. We have for some time past been engaged in considering the question of dealing with cases of tuberculosis in the Borough, having regard to the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1911, the Finance Act of the same Session, the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1912, and the various circulars issued by the Local Government Board and other Government publications. 45 We would remind the Council that Poor Law cases of pulmonary tuberculosis first became notifiable on 1st January, 1908. This was followed by a further Order making notifiable from 1st May, 1911, the cases of that disease which were treated at hospitals, dispensaries, &c., and as and from the 1st January, 1912, cases of pulmonary tuberculosis became generally notifiable. The system of notification has since been extended to all cases of tuberculosis. It will be remembered that the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1911, did not confer upon Metropolitan Borough Councils any statutory right to be represented upon any authority executing the provisions of that Act, and the Insurance Committee for the County of London has been, in fact, appointed without reference to the Borough Councils In accordance, however, with a scheme which has recently been published, the Borough Councils have, as a matter of grace, been given a representation (onefifth of the Committee) upon the District Insurance Committees of their respective Boroughs. The National Insurance Act requires County Insurance Committees to make arrangements for insured persons to receive treatment for Tuberculosis, and empowers them to extend their arrangements so as to include also the dependents or any class of dependants of insured persons. The Act also provides that any estimated excess of expenditure over income may be met as to half by the " Local Authority " and as to the other half from the Exchequer in cases where the expenditure has been sanctioned by the Local Authority and the Treasury. We understand that the London County Council are undertaking the provision of sanatorium treatment for consumptives and they will receive grants from the Government and the Insurance Funds towards the cost of sanatoria, &c. The County Insurance Committee will make arrangements with the London County Council for the sanatorium treatment of insured persons and possibly the dependants, and any non-insured persons recommended by approved Tuberculosis Dispensaries for such treatment will no doubt be favourably considered with a view to sanatorium treatment. From the circulars of the Local Government Board we gather that the Board desire that Metropolitan Borough Councils should submit schemes dealing with Dispensary treatment locally for all tuberculous patients (whether insured or noninsured), whilst, as indicated above, it is proposed to deal with sanatorium and other institutional treatment for insured persons and probably their dependants centrally. We should at this point, however, make it quite clear that there is no legal obligation imposed on the Council to provide Dispensaries as proposed. 46 The Medical Officer of Health has submitted to us three reports which have now been amalgamated into one, a copy of which is sent herewith. The Medical Officer has reminded us that as a result of an appeal made by the Ex-Mayor (Alderman Potter) a sum of over £900 was publicly raised to assist the Memorial Fund to King Edward VII, and that this sum was utilised for the purpose of assisting to furnish and equip three Tuberculosis Dispensaries in this Borough, the amount being equally divided between the dispensaries. These dispensaries, it should be stated, were inaugurated before Tuberculosis became notifiable, and consequently the Council could not officially take part in their work. Inasmuch as in exercise of the powers conferred by Sec. 75 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Council as a sanitary authority had provided hospital accommodation, we utilised the services of the Stepney Dispensary by requiring all applicants for admission thereto for treatment on sanatorium lines to be examined by the Dispensary Medical Officer, and also arranged that the Public Health Department should as far as possible co-operate in the work of the Committee. The Medical Officer of Health has also in his private capacity acted as Chairman of the Committee of the Stepney Dispensary (Arbour Square) and also Chairman of the Joint Committee which has the general oversight of the three dispensaries. The three Tuberculosis Dispensaries which have been established in this Borough are at present situate as follows, viz. :— 4, Arbour Square (The Stepney Dispensary). 208, High Street, Shadwell (The St. George-in-the-East Dispensary). 18, Great Prescot Street (The Whitechapel Dispensary). These institutions are each managed by a separate Committee who send representatives to a Joint Committee which, in order to prevent overlapping, &c., has, we understand, general control, but not the appointment of members of the staff of each Dispensary. We also learn that a building for use as a permanent dispensary has been secured at No. 35, Stepney Green, and the Local Government Board were asked by the Management Committee to approve certain alterations at the premises to make them suitable as a Tuberculosis Dispensary. On the 16th October, 1912, we reported that the Local Government Board had, during the month of August, approved the above Dispensaries under Section 16 (1) (a) of the National Insurance Act, 1911, for a period of 6 months, and had also informed the authorities of the Dispensaries that if they desired the period of approval extended, they should communicate with this Council, presumably this period has been extended. 47 No direct request for the submission of a scheme for dealing with tuberculosis has been addressed to this Council, but the Local Government Board have indirectly asked the Council to submit such a scheme, as the following will show. In a communication addressed by the Board to the Town Clerk on 17th October, 1912, the Board intimated that they "would be glad to be informed whether this proposed Dispensary (No. 3-5, Stepney Green) will form part of the Borough Council's Scheme for the treatment of tuberculosis and to be furnished with full particulars of their scheme." The Board further intimated that if it was proposed to apply for a grant towards the capital cost involved, a detailed estimate should be furnished. The Local Government Board have pointed out in a circular communication, dated 6th December, 1912, addressed to Councils of Counties and County Boroughs (England), that it would be a great advantage in the interests of the community as a whole, if schemes could be undertaken which would cover not only insured persons and their dependants, but also uninsured persons. The Treasury are willing to bear half of any deficiency under this head. The Local Government Board therefore suggest that County Insurance Committees should extend sanatorium benefit in so far as institutional treatment is concerned to the dependants of insured persons and should arrange, subject to the consent of the Insurance Commissioners, to pay over to the Local Authorities the sums available for institutional treatment and that Local Authorities should be responsible for such treatment of all classes whether insured or dependants of insured or wow-insured, A copy of this circular communication was transmitted to this Council and in a short covering letter the Board state that " the circular is generally applicable to the Metropolis, but as the arrangements in London are somewhat different from those outside, some adaptation of the procedure may have to be made." The Local Government Board had prior to this in a circular communication, dated 14th May, 1912, addressed to County Councils, Councils of Boroughs, Urban and Rural District Councils intimated that they unhesitatingly endorsed the opinion expressed by the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis, presided over by Mr. Waldorf Astor, M.P., " that the organisation of schemes throughout the country can best be carried out if undertaken by Local Authorities." The Board asked to be informed before the 8th June, 1912, of the progress made in each County and County Borough and requested that when the schemes were submitted, the Board should be provided with a statement showing as far as might be practicable the estimated annual expenditure and the sources from which it would be met. In a further communication dated 27th July, 1912, addressed by the Local Government Board to County Councils, Sanitary Authorities, and Insurance 48 mittees, and transmitting copies of the Board's Order, prescribing the manner of domicilary treatment of injured persons suffering from Tuberculosis, the following . sentence appears :— " The Board contemplate that when the provision for combating this " disease, which has been recommended by the Departmental Committee " on Tuberculosis, is complete, a Dispensary with an expert consulting " officer will be available in every area as part of the general public health " organisation." The Order provides (inter alia) that the consulting officer of a dispensary approved by the Board should be the consulting officer for the purposes of the regulations, and that until such officer is appointed, the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary Authority (in London) should act in that capacity. After considerable discussion and having regard to all the conditions existing in Stepney, we came to the conclusion that it wou'd be desirable that a scheme for the Dispensary Treatment of Tuberculous Patients should be prepared, especially in view of the fact that without the Local Government Board's approval, the Government grant of half of the cost of the treatment of non-insured persons would not be received in this Borough, and we therefore instructed the Medical Officer of Health to submit a draft scheme to us. The Medical Officer of Health submitted a lengthy report and advised that there were three methods which might be adopted by the Council having regard to the existing dispensaries. 1. The sole management and control of the dispensaries should be vested in the Borough Council. 2. The management and control should be vested in a consultative mittee, composed of members of the Borough Council and of the existing Voluntary Committee. 3. The management and control should be vested in the Voluntary mittee, with a representative or two from the Borough Council. The Medical Officer of Health had some difficulty in drafting his scheme as he found it necessary to consult the Dispensaries Committee, the Local Sanatorium Sub-Committee appointed by the County Insurance Committee, and the local medical practitioners, as well r.s to bear in mind the views expressed by the Council and ourselves on various occasions, and also to have regard to the probable cost of the scheme and the amount of the grants which would be likely to be received in respect of the treatment of insured persons and the question of the performance of domicilary treatment, &c. 49 The Dispensaries Committee asked us to confer with them on the matter, and a conference was held at the Public Health Offices on Friday, 24th January, 1913, when there were present :—Councillor T. J. Evans (in the Chair), Alderman Boustred, Councillors Bernstein, Birley, Hume, Jackson, Newell, Reidy and Samuel (Miss), Miss A. Burkitt, Miss M. E. Bennett (Secretary), Miss Falck, Miss M. F. Heysham (Hon. Sec.), Miss M. G. Hay, Miss J. Hoare, Miss G. S. McGaw, Miss P. Schuster, Dr. W. E. Goss, Rev. G. M. Hanks, Dr. E. B. Hastings, Rev. H. Iselin, Mr. H. R. Levinsohn, Mr. J. Parsons and Rev. G. C. Wilton. The Resolution adopted at the Conference was as follows :— That this Conference is of opinion that scheme 3 of the Medical Officer of Health's report down to the words ''from the rates" should be adopted for a period of twelve months, on the understanding that during such period the Dispensaries Committee will guarantee that there shall be no charge upon the rates. The Provisional Medical Committee of the Tower Hamlets have passed the following resolution —- That the Provisional Medical Committee considers that no scheme for the treatment of Tuberculosis will be successful unless it includes some means whereby the co-operation of general practitioners will be secured, and for this purpose suggests that domiciliary treatment and examination of contacts should be undertaken as far as possible by the general practitioner attending the case, and that no such work should be done by dispensary medical officers without the consent and co-operation of such practitioners. With regard to this resolution, the Medical Officer of Health proposes that " domiciliary treatment " of persons suffering from Tuberculosis should be undertaken generally by the local medical practitioners, except in emergencies, but this treatment does not include the visits which would be made by the Tuberculosis Officer to the homes of patients for the purpose of the examination of "contacts." As the Medical Officer of Health states in his report : " we must not wait until the infected members of a family present themselves for treatment. It is then often too late. We must follow the patients to their homes and search for the disease." We would at this juncture remind the Council that at their meeting held on 16th October, 1912, a report was presented by us upon matters relating to the National Insurance Act, 1911, and the provision of Dispensary and Sanatorium Treatment was considered, and upon our recommendation the terms of the following resolutions amongst others were agreed to, viz. :— (a) That in each Metropolitan Borough or City, the local Council should be named as the body responsible for the administration of the local Tuberculosis Dispensary, and for the local execution of the scheme; D 50 (b) That, subject to the provision contained in (c), the Medical Officer of Health should be named as the officer responsible to the local Council for the administration of the local Tuberculosis Dispensary, and for the local execution of the scheme ; but entirely without prejudice to the right of the Council hereafter to require the payment of reasonable remuneration to be given to their own Medical Officer of Health and other officers whose services are utilised in the administration of the National Insurance Act; (c) That the Chief Tuberculosis Officer of the Dispensary should be independent of control by any other medical man so far as his clinical duties are concerned ; but that, in regard to the general conduct and administration of the Dispensary, he should act under the direction of the local Medical Officer of Health ; (d) That the Committee appointed by the Council of the Metropolitan Borough or City to manage a local Dispensary should have power to co-opt as members of the Committee persons who are not members of the Council of the Borough or City which the local Dispensary serves. After very carefully considering the matter, we have arrived at the conclusion that the only satisfactory method to adopt in Stepney will be for the Council to be solely responsible for the management and control of the Dispensary system in this Borough. We are strongly of opinion that this system should be a branch of the Public Health Department, and that the Medical Officer of Health should be its administrative head responsible to the Council, whilst the officers would be on the staff of that department with statutory powers under the Tuberculosis Regulations. We would point out that the present Voluntary Committee is a self-constituted body of persons who are not responsible either to the residents or ratepayers of Stepney, whether insured or uninsured, and that its membership may vary from time to time without the persons most concerned or their representatives being consulted. We do not desire to minimise the great work which these philanthropic ladies and gentlemen have performed in the Borough. They have given most generously of their time and money and have undoubtedly organised an excellent system which can, with certain modifications, easily be grafted into the Council's work and which, we think, can now be more advantageously and efficiently performed under municipal control than as a voluntary enterprise, dependent upon the good health and willingness to give their services of a number of persons who might in the future be unable or unwilling to continue their work in this district and thus jeopardise the existence of their undertaking. We had hoped, therefore, that means would have been devised whereby the Dispensaries, their equipment and records should be handed over to this Council 51 so that there shall be no break in the continuity of the work, and in return the Council would take over the liability for the organisation and management of the Dispensaries in the future. There would be no necessity for members of the Voluntary Committee to sever their connection with the work of the Dispensaries entirely. They could, we would point out, be co-opted on the Dispensary Committee and act as a Care Committee to assist the dependents of Consumptive persons ; provide for their maintenance during the time the breadwinner is recuperating at a Sanatorium or other institution, and give other charitable assistance in many directions. We sincerely hope that they will see their way to co-operate with us in the manner indicated so that the Borough would still benefit by their services and interest. The Medical Officer of Health assumed in his first Report that the existing Dispensaries would be included in the Council's scheme. Under Scheme 1, the cost after deducting estimated income from the Insurance Fund in respect of insured persons, would be borne equally by the Treasury and the local rates, the charge on the rates being estimated at between £700 and £1,000 per annum. Under Scheme 2, a grant would, no doubt, be received from the Central Fund for the Promotion of the Dispensary System (a voluntary organisation) for the prevention of consumption and the amount of the contribution from the rates would be reduced to the extent of a moiety of such contribution. Under Scheme 3, apart from a subsidy, no contribution from the rates would be required as long as the voluntary subscriptions were collected, and it will be seen from the resolution passed at our Conference with the Dispensaries Committee that they are willing to guarantee that no such contribution would be required for at least twelve months. In the above cases the estimate of cost is based upon actual experience. We understand that the Dispensaries Committee refuse to transfer the existing dispensaries to the Council, or come to any other satisfactory arrangement with us, and we presume therefore that the Local Government Board will decline permanently to extend the period of their approval of these dispensaries as part of the Scheme for dealing with tuberculosis in Stepney, and, consequently, they will not be available for the treatment of insured persons, nor will the Dispensaries Committee receive particulars of the notifications of this disease which are sent to the Medical Officer of Health, and the cases will be dealt with, if necessary, at the Council's Dispensary. It will be necessary then for the Council to establish a new dispensary, and four-fifths of the cost of any capital expenditure (not exceeding £1 per 750 population, say £373) will be paid by the Treasury if the expenditure is approved by the D 2 52 Local Government Board, and the annual maintenance charge after crediting income in respect of insured persons will be borne equally by the rates and the Treasury. We therefore instructed the Medical Officer of Health to prepare and submit to us a more detailed estimate of the cost of the establishment of a new dispensary, and a copy of this estimate is embodied in his report. It will be observed that the annual estimated expenditure is given at from £1,385 to £1,575. The annual amount estimated to be chargeable to the local rates after receipt of the contribution from the Insurance Funds and the Local Government Board's grant is £190 to £290, and if to the latter amount is added the sum of £312 for the reservation of two beds for males and two for females in Sanatoria for the accommodation of uninsured persons, the net expense to the Borough of the Dispensary Scheme will be £602, or £10 less than the amount paid by the Council for sanatorium treatment for consumptives during the past year. When these figures are considered, the Council should bear in mind that we have received no official information as to the amount to be contributed by the County Insurance Committee towards the cost of dispensary treatment; but the Medical Officer has informed us that he bases his estimate that £1,000 will be received for the treatment of insured persons upon the results of inquiries in various directions and upon the information supplied to him by that Committee that the number of insured persons resident in Stepney is 93,000, although this figure is much greater than the Medical Officer of Health had himself estimated. In the Departmental Committee's Report on Tuberculosis already referred to it is suggested that in Urban Districts one dispensary might be allotted for every 150,000 to 200,000 inhabitants. On this basis there should be two dispensaries in Stepney ; but although we should be prepared to recommend the Council to take over the management of the three existing dispensaries which serve distinct and well-defined areas and are undoubtedly conveniently situated for persons living in the districts served, yet the work could, we think—at any rate, in its early stages— be carried on in one building serving the whole of the Borough, although this would not be nearly so convenient for the persons desiring treatment as the existing buildings. On the grounds of economy, therefore, we should only be prepared to recommend the Council to establish one new dispensary at present, especially as we think that satisfactory arrangements can be made with the authorities of the London Hospital and the Victoria Park Hospital for Diseases of the Chest for the establishment of Branch Dispensaries attached to those institutions, as suggested by the Medical Officer of Health. As instructed by the Council we have given careful consideration to the views submitted by the Deputation from the Committee of the existing Tuberculosis Dispensaries in the Borough. 53 We have received from the Dispensaries Committee a statement of the conditions upon which they suggest that the existing dispensaries should be recognised by the Council. Among these conditions are the following :— (4) That the Chief Medical Officer of the Dispensary shall, under the administrative direction of the Medical Officer of Health, act as Tuberculosis Officer to the Borough in the carrying out of a comprehensive scheme for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis in the Borough. (5) That in everything pertaining to the diagnosis and treatment of patients the Chief Medical Officer of the Dispensary shall be independent of control by the Medical Officer of Health or any other medical man. (8) That the Dispensary shall be managed by a Committee conforming to the rules of the Central Fund, which Committee shall raise the necessary means for the maintenance and efficient working of the Dispensary. (9) That if the Borough Council vote a substantial contribution to the funds of the Dispensary, the Executive Committee of the Dispensary shall invite the Borough Council to nominate three representatives, including the Medical Officer of Health, the latter to be ev-of/icio a member of the Dispensary Committee. These conditions have, we are informed, been drawn up by the management of the Central Fund ; but we understand that the Local Dispensary Committee are themselves of opinion that the Council's representation should be largely increased, and that they have arranged to confer with the Committee of the Central Fund upon the subject, and also upon the question of the control by the Medical Officer of Health of the Staff of the Dispensary. Whilst three-fourths of the funds of the local Dispensary Committee are drawn from the Central Fund (one-fourth being required to be raised locally by voluntary subscriptions), it is obvious that the Committee of that Fund will desire to possess considerable control over the expenditure in connection with the Dispensaries and the principles upon which the institutions are conducted, and it might be extremely difficult for the Council's representatives or the Medical Officer of Health to secure that the work of the Dispensaries should be conductcd on lines conforming to our work in connection with the Public Health administration of the Borough, if either the local Committee or the Committee of the Central Fund intimated that any particular policy suggested was not acceptable to them. Again, we are of opinion, as already stated, that the officers of the Dispensary should be members of the Staff of the Public Health Department, and unless these officers are in the Council's employment we do not think that the Medical Officer of Health would have the control over them which would be necessary in order to obtain efficient service on lines acceptable to the Council. 54 After, therefore, considering the matter in all its aspects, we have come to the conclusion that the best course to be adopted will be for the Council to inform the local Dispensaries Committee that their suggested scheme is not acceptable to the Council, and also to instruct us to submit a scheme for the establishment of a Dispensary under the sole control of the Council, on the lines suggested by the Medical Officer of Health. Should the Council adopt our recommendations appended below, it will, in due course, be necessary, in pursuance of Sec. 8 (3) of the London Government Act, 1899, to consult the Finance and Parliamentary Committee, for no liability, such as that we recommend, can legally be incurred except upon a resolution of the Council passed on an estimate submitted by that Committee. As will be gathered above, the financial side of the question is an important one, particularly as the ratepayers of Stepney will, in addition to contributing to our proposed scheme as Borough Ratepayers, most probably have to contribute to the County rate in respect of expenses of the London County Council in the event of Sanatoria being provided by them, and also to meet an insufficiency in the amount payable to the Insurance Committee for the administration of Medical and Sanatorium benefits. These maters will, doubtless, receive due consideration at the hands of the Finance and Parliamentary Committee. We recommend— (1) That the Committee of the Stepney Dispensaries be informed that this Council have carefully considered the views expressed by the Deputation on the 19th February, and are strongly of opinion that it is impossible for the Council efficiently to carry out their statutory duties with regard to Tuberculosis on the lines suggested by the Dispensaries Committee ; (2) That the Medical Officer of Health's report be approved and subject to the submission to the Council by the Finance Committee of an estimate, as required by Section 8 (3) of the London Government Act, 1899 ; that the Council do express the opinion that at the expiration of the term of the Local Government Board's approval of the existing Dispensaries, viz., 15th July, 1913, a complete Dispensary Scheme under the Council's control should come into operation in this Borough, and that it be referred to us to submit such a scheme for approval on the lines of the Medical Officer of Health's report. The Council, taking into consideration the fact that as it was uncertain at present what sum is available for the Sanatorium treatment of insured persons, referred the matter back to the Committee. 55 Infantile Mortality. 946 infants died under one year of age, which corresponds to a death rate of 110 per 1,000 births. This number is 315 less than in the previous year. 233 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 126 per 1,000 births ; 202 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 128 per 1,000 births ; 348 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 100 per 1,000 births ; 163 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 96 per 1,000 births. The infantile mortality for the whole of London was 91 per 1,000 births. Deaths of Illegitimate Children. There were 36 deaths of illegitimate children under one year of age during the year, or at the rate of 200 per 1,000 illegitimate births. 5 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 178 per 1,000 illegitimate births; 12 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of 300 per 1,000 illegitimate births ; 13 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 260 per 1,000 mate births ; 6 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 96 per 1,000 illegitimate births. In spite of the fact that there was a large number of deaths of infants from measles, the infantile mortality is low. This is due to a great extent to the cool and wet summer which we experienced. As I have pointed out in previous reports, there has been a gradual improvement in this direction, which is not due to favourable meteorological conditions, but to improved sanitary conditions and to the realisation of the fact that innumerable and unnecessary deaths were occurring from year to year. This improvement, as is seen in the following table, is most marked in the Limehouse District, where a Health Visitor has been concentrating her efforts for several years. 66 Average Infantile Mortality for five-year periods, from 1890-1909 :— Limehouse. St. Georges. Mile End. Whitechapel. Whole Borough. 1890-1894 186 197 175 163 178 1895-1899 204 187 166 147 168 1900-1904 201 162 148 135 157 1905-1909 153 142 120 112 129 1910 137 120 100 110 113 1911 189 170 138 106 149 1912 126 128 100 96 110 Report on the work of the Health Visitor. During the year 1912 the number of births visited by the Council's Health Visitor was 1,275. Of this number 33 died, and the parents of 14 removed before the first visit was made. In nine instances an incorrect address had been given. 155 cases were attended by doctors, the remainder were attended by midwives. The majority of the infants were breast-fed entirely at the time of the first visit of the Health Visitor; but it was found at subsequent visits that artificial feeding, either partly or entirely, was resorted to after the first month or so. At the first visit 1,041 infants were breast-fed, 50 were artificially fed and 128 were partly breast and partly bottle-fed Nestle's Milk was more generally used than cow's milk. Boiled bread, teabiscuits and oatmeal were sometimes given to supplement breast-feeding. 229 were first-born children ; the mothers were more anxious to learn and appreciated the instructions given than the mothers who had several children. Instruction as to the necessity for cleanliness, fresh air, suitable clothing and regularity of feeding was given. Where feeding bottles were used the boat-shape bottle was recommended as being easier to cleanse than one with a long tube. 227 infants died before they were a year old, which is equivalent to an infantile mortality of 125 per 1,000 births. If the 33 deaths of infants who died immediately after birth and before the first visit was made were excluded, tne infantile mortality for the area would be 110 per 1,000 births. 67 Infantile mortality in the area where the Health Visitor works, together with that for the Limehouse District and for the whole Borough :— Health Visitor's Area. Limehouse District.

In the above cases where the mothers worked away from home, they usually worked to within four weeks of the birth, and resumed work in four to eight weeks after. When the mother resumes work at the factory the child is looked after by a woman in the same house or taken to a neighbour to be nursed. These women keep the babies clean and give them the bottle during the day. They unfortunately give " bits of everything going " to even quite young infants. Where the mothers are employed at their own homes they frequently work to within a few hours of confinement, and resume work fourteen days later. 74 premises in various parts of the Borough were visited at the request of the Almoners of the London Hospital, and a report sent on the home conditions. 54 insanitary premises were referred to the Sanitary Inspectors. 3 cases of neglect of children were reported to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. 33 newly-confined mothers were recommended for extra nourishment to the Stepney Invalid Kitchen, and granted in every case. 1,556 re-visits were made. The infants were found to be fairly well cared for. In the instances where neglect takes place it is usually owing to the necessity of the mother having to earn the money for the next meal. The mothers do their best to carry out the instructions given. 58 TABLE SHOWING THE FEEDING OF INFANTS AT DIFFERENT PERIODS DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF INFANCY. Nature of Food. Weeks.

The Council passed a resolution to adopt the above Act on July 28th, 1909, and the sanction of the Local Government Board having been obtained, the Act came into force on September 8th, 1909. During the first year the provisions of the Act were only partially complied with and a large percentage of the births remained unnotified. In 1910, 852 births were registered that had not been notified, or a percentage of 8-9. In 1911, the number of births not notified was 156, or a percentage of 1-8 of the total births registered. The provisions of the Act were widely advertised, and copies of a portion of the Act were sent to the doctors and midwives practising in the Borough. In June 1910, at the request of the Public Health Committee, a letter was sent to those doctors who were most in default, again calling their attention to the provisions of the Act and the penalty incurred for failure to give notice of a birth. One doctor had neglected to notify 105 births during the first half of 1910. In the third quarter of 1910, the same doctor failed to notify 25 births in spite of the warning issued in June, and the Public Health Committee decided to recommend the Council to take proceedings against him. The recommendation, together with a letter from the doctor, was considered by the Council and it was decided that no proceedings should be taken on that occasion. On February 24th, 1912, the same doctor forwarded a list of 56 births which he had attended from January 2nd to February 22nd of that year. In this list, in many instances, he had omitted the sex as well as the names of the infants. Under the provisions of the Act it is the duty of the father of the child born in the district, and, of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time, or within six hours of the birth, to give notice of the birth to the Medical Officer of Health in the manner provided by the Act, within 36 hours after the birth ; such notification should give the necessary information of the birth, and medical practitioners are supplied with stamped addressed postcards for the purpose. As the doctor above referred to failed to notify within the proper time and supply the necessary particulars and had been previously cautioned, police court proceedings were taken and he was fined 7s. and 23s. costs on March 22nd, 1912. 8,676 live births and 244 still births were notified during the year. 4,291 of these were notified by doctors, 4,599 by midwives, and 30 by the parents. 132 births were registered that had not been notified. 61 Old Ago. 181 deaths were attributable to Old Age. This corresponds to a death rate of .65 per 1,000 of the population. 49 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of -92 per 1,000. 20 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of -42 per 1,000. 84 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of -75 per 1,000. 28 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of -42 per 1,000.

The death rate throughout the whole Borough was -12 per 1,000 of the population. Cancer. The deaths due to Cancer were 232, or 4 less than in the previous year. This corresponds to a death rate of '83 per 1,000 of the population. 49 belonged to the Limehouse District, or at the rate of -92 per 1,000. 34 belonged to St. George-in-the-East, or at the rate of -72 per 1,000. 88 belonged to Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of -79 per 1,000. 61 belonged to the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of -91 per 1,000. Glanders. Under the London (Notification of Glanders) Order, 1907, the Veteiinary Inspector of the London County Council reported, in accordance with the provisions of that Order, the existence of Glanders in seven stables in the Borough, in which 10 horses were affected. Inhabited House Duty. 19 applications were received for certificates under the Inland Revenue Act, 1903, for the purpose of securing exemption from Inhabited House Duty. Certificates were granted for 110 tenements, and refused for 11 tenements. Verminous Persons. 2,305 verminous persons were cleansed during the year and their clothing disinfected. 2,292 were adults—2,280 men and 12 women ; 13 children were cleansed —12 boys and 1 girl. 63 Articles Destroyed on account of their condition and at the request of the Owners. Mattresses 62 Coats 7 Beds 29 Couch 1 Palliasses 13 Trousers 11 Blankets 2 Vests 6 Cushions 3 Sundries 153 Pillows 6 — Bolsters 2 303 Sheets 3 — Rooms Disinfected. 4,435 rooms were disinfected during the year, 2,301 having been occupied by persons suffering from infectious disease, 765 by consumptives. 1,369 rooms were in a verminous condition, and were fumigated. About the end of June I received a communication from the Secretary of the London Hospital that a great number of patients attended at that institution suffering from Scabies, and for whom sulphur oaths were provided. It was suggested that the Public Health Department should co-operate with the Hospital Authorities whereby the bedding and clothes of these patients could be disinfected so as to obviate re infection after treatment, which was constantly occurring This has been done, and from July 25th until the end of December the clothing, &c., of 250 patients were disinfected after their permission had been first obtained.

Of these 44 were " watched," in accordance with the Jewish custom. 504 inquests were held in the Coroner's Court, and 109 post mortem examinations were made Canal Boats Acts 1877 and 1884. Pursuant to the Third Section of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I have to report, with regard to the execution of such Acts and of the Regulations made thereunder, and as to the steps taken during the year, to give effect to the provisions of the said Acts and Regulations, viz.:— (1) Canal boats coming within the district are inspected by a Sanitary Inspector, who receives a sum of £10 per annum for the performance of this duty. His inspection is irrespective of the examination of boats made by the Examining Officer prior to their registration. (2) The number of Boats inspected in 1912 was 51, and the condition of the Boats and their occupants, as regards the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations, was very good. (3) Infringements of Acts and Regulations were discovered as follows:— (a) Registration—Nil. (b) Notification of change of Master—Nil. (c) Certificates—One. (d) Marking—One. (e) Overcrowding—Nil. (f) Separation of Sexes—Nil. (g) Cleanliness—One. (h) Ventilation—Nil. (i) Painting—One. (j) Provision of Water Cask—Nil. (k) Removal of Bilge Water—Nil. (I) Notification of Infectious Disease—Nil. (m) Admittance of Inspector—Nil. (4) No legal proceedings were taken. (5) In the case of infringement, notice was sent to the owner of the Boat requiring him to remedy the cause of complaint, and to forward to this E 66 Borough, within a specified period, a certificate signed by some duly appointed Inspector of Canal Boats that the same had been duly done. Such certificate was afterwards received. (6) No case of Infectious Disease occurred. (7) No Boats were detained for Cleansing and Disinfection. (8) The total number of Boats on the Register on the 31st December, 1912 :— (a) Number of Boats believed to be in use or available was ... 14 (b) Number of Boats that cannot be traced Nil. (9) One Boat was Registered in 1912. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 1,083 registered premises where milk is sold, which included 32 cowsheds. 65 premises were removed from the register, due to their unsuitability, or the sale of milk had been discontinued, and 14 were refused registration for a similar reason. Each shop was considered on its merits, and certain conditions were imposed before it was registered. The conditions for every new registration generally included that— (1) The shop, milk receptacles and utensils must be kept scrupulously clean. The milk must also be kept in a cleanly condition. (2) The milk must be covered by a proper ventilated cover ; paper, muslin or a plain board is not allowed. (3) Boxes of minerals, or other boxes, sacks, bags, &c., must not be allowed to remain on the floor, but raised on shelves at least a foot from the floor. This allows the floor to be swept, otherwise it would only be swept when the sacks or boxes became empty and dirt would accumulate under and behind them. (4) The shop floor must be swept and scrubbed frequently. (5) The shelves must be kept free from dust. (6) No paraffin, coal, coke, vegetables or Dutch herrings are to be sold. Police Court Proceedings under the Dairies. Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders. On January 12th Mr. Laty Topfelt, of 18, Yalford Street, was summoned for selling milk without being registered.

On March 12th, 1912. Mr. William Olley, 200, Bow Common Lane, was summoned for exposing for sale on a stall in Burdett Road, 14 lbs. of bacon which was unfit for human food. He was fined £10 or six weeks in default. Proceedings were taken against Mr. David Weir, of the East London Produce Company, Ltd., for selling corned beef for human food which was unsound and unwholesome. On December 21st, 1911, I received a telephonic communication from the superintendent of a wharf in our Borough that Mr. Weir had presented a delivery order for 32 cases of corned beef which had been rejected or thrown out as unfit for human food. Each case contained 12 tins, weighing 6 lbs. each. I informed Mr. Weir that the contents of the tins could only be sold for poultry and pig feeding, and they were to be removed for that purpose under my supervision. On December 23rd, Mr. Weir undertook to give us the necessary information as to the disposal of the goods for poultry feeding. During the first week in January Mr. Weir called at 43, White Horse Street, and said that he proposed sending four cases to Mr. Walter Wells, East Dereham. Mr. Abson told him not to send them until he had a reply from the Sanitary Authority for East Dereham. A satisfactory reply having been received on January 15th, the goods were sent on January 17th, and the sanitary officials of East Dereham were informed of the fact. This is the only consignment that Mr. Weir informed us of goods that were disposed of for poultry feeding. Mr. Weir is trading as the East London Produce Company (Limited). The tins of coined beef were purchased from a firm of corned beef dealers, who had rejected them because they were blown or pierced. On March 13th, I received a communication from the Chief Sanitary Inspector for Glasgow that 59 cases of corned beef had been sent to the East London Produce Company, to be used by that firm as food for poultry. They were sent on the distinct understanding that they should on no account be used for any other purpose. Mr. Weir, on being communicated with, said that he had received 59 cases from Glasgow and had made an examination of them. Some of them, he said, were only collapsed, the others were pierced. He pointed out the parcel which he considered was good, and which consisted of six cases and eight tins, or 80 tins altogether. Mr. Weir had sold six cases to a provision merchant in Globe Road, at 24s. a case, with a 60 days guarantee; two cases to a tradesman in Canning Town, at 25s. a case, with a 30 days guarantee; and 11 cases to a tradesman in Bow Common 70 Lane for 23s. a case, with 60 days guarantee; 10 cases to another tradesman in Angel Lane, Stratford. Information was given to the Sanitary Authority of West Ham relating to the Canning Town and Angel Lane parcels. No tins were found at the latter place, but 22 tins were found in the former; these were seized and condemned by the Magistrate, and the East London Produce Company was afterwards fined £20 and £5 5s. costs. Sixty out of the sixty-six tins which had been sold to the tradesman in Globe Road were in a putrid condition, and were condemned by the Magistrate. Mr. Weir had arranged to pay 4s. a case to the wholesale firm for all the tins. All the invoices to Mr. Weir or the East London Produce Company were marked " to be used for poultry food." Mr. Weir was charged (1) for depositing for sale at 138, Old Church Road, seven tins of corned beef, which were unsound and unwholesome; (2) for having sold 60 tins of corned beef to the tradesman in Globe Road, knowing or having reason to believe that they were unfit for human food. The case was first heard at the Thames Police Court, where Mr. Weir elected to go for trial by a jury. The case lasted two days at the Police Court and two full days at the Central Criminal Court. Judge Rentoul, in summing up, remarked that " the selling of diseased food, or food likely to poison people, was about the most dastardly kind of murder that could possibly be committed. A large number of people died in this city because of the food they ate. It had been said by one authority that in this city and other parts ot the country more people died from impure food than from hunger, If a man murdered another with a knife or pistol he was pretty safe to be caught and hanged. But the man who, for profit to himself, indulged in business of this sort, especially among the poor, was carrying on about as wicked a business as could be carried on. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, had been passed to try to minimise—though he was afraid that no Statute would ever stop entirely—offences of this kind, for which, in some countries, men would be lynched." The jury having found the prisoner guilty on both counts, Judge Rentoul said it was sad that a man of defendant's obvious abilities should descend to practices of this sort, which were so terribly destructive and cruel. He sentenced him to four months' imprisonment with hard labour. On September 18th. Mr. Jack Woolf, of 103, Hogarth Houses, was summoned for exposing for sale on a barrow, 71 lbs. of plums which, were unsound and unfit for human food. He was fined 21s. 71 General Sanitary Work. In the Sanitary Inspectors' Report table will be found the record of the work carried out by each Inspector during the year, together with its nature. 37,898 houses were inspected, 5,660 being the result of house to house inspection. 14,322 intimation notices were served for the abatement of various nuisances, for which it was necessary to serve 7,492 statutory notices before the defects were remedied. 63,892 re-visits were made to supervise the abatement of the nuisances complained of. 4,703 visits were made to the houses of consumptive people who had been notified to be suffering from that disease. (This does not include the visits made by the Assistant Medical Officer of Health.) Police Court proceedings were taken in 53 instances where the statutory notices were disregarded. This number does not, of course, include proceedings under the Food and Drugs Acts. 7,445 drains were tested with smoke, and 2,497 were either constructed or re-constructed, cleansed or repaired, and 778 were trapped. 318 new soil pipes were fixed and ventilated ; 1,421 new closet pans and traps were fixed, and 2,437 closets were either cleansed and repaired or provided with additional light and ventilation, as well as 2,067 water closets provided with proper flushing apparatus. 3,077 yards, forecourts and areas were paved or repaired. Notices were served to provide 1,307 sanitary dust receptacles; 66 manure receptacles were provided ; 676 offensive accumulations were removed from the rear of dwelling houses. 890 houses were ventilated underneath the lower floor. 32 underground rooms, which were illegally occupied were discontinued from being used as such. 62 notices were served for the abatement of smoke nuisances. 333 bakehouses were visited and 271 cleansing notices were served. 4,668 notices were served to have houses cleansed, and water supply was reinstated to 140 houses. 72 358 sink, bath or rainwater pipes, which were communicating directly with the drains, were disconnected. 5,503 miscellaneous repairs to roof, floors, gutters, &c., were made as the result of notices served. 800 damp walls were remedied, and 104 rooms were provided with additional light and ventilation. The nuisance due to the keeping of too many animals in back yards was abated in 95 houses. Overcrowding. 17,135 inspections were specially made for the purpose of detecting overcrowding, and 549 living rooms were found to be overcrowded, 597 intimation notices were served for the abatement of the nuisance and 158 statutory notices. This was necessary to be followed by Police Court proceedings in five instances. Police Court Proceedings for the abatement of Overcrowding.
