STMART 6 Abstracts of the Reports OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE Parish OF ST. MARTIN-IN-THE-FIELDS FROM FEBRUARY, 1856, TO MARCH 81, 1857. london: w. s. johnson, 60, st. martin's lane, charing cross, w.c. 1857. ABSTRACTS OF REPORTS. February, 1856.—The state of the public health satisfactory—the number of deaths being below the average. The smallest number of deaths during the last ten years was recorded last week To form a table 6f prevailing diseases, the Guardians of the Poor have granted permission to inspect the books of the Parochial Medical Officers. From 1852 to 1855 the average annual number of deaths in St. Martin's Parish was 605. In the preceding four years, from 1846 to 1849, the number was 654. In both periods there was an outbreak of cholera. In our Parish, sanitary measures had been adopted to a great extent, before the passing of the Metropolitan Management Act; and we may fairly impute the improved condition of the health of the Parish to these measures. Our average number of deaths per thousand has been 24, which, if reduced to 22, the average of healthy town districts, it would prolong the lives of no less than 50 persons every year in this Parish alone. February 10, 1856.—The attention of the Vestry was called to Pipemaker's Alley, as requiring improvement in regard to water supply, privy accommodation, etc., etc. The deplorable state of Taylor's Buildings was pointed out. 4 February 15, 1850.—An underground dwelling in York Place reported as unfit for habitation. March, 1856.—Public health reported above the average. Prevailing epidemics—typhus fever and hooping cough. Table of deaths and diseases referred to. The deaths in the Workhouse and Charing Cross Hospital are distinguished by separate columns. The state of the vaults under the Church and Vestry House described. In consequence of effluvia rising into the Vestry Room, the coffins in the vault below were removed to one of the catacombs. No great inconvenience occurred; and it was recommended that all outlying coffins should be collected into one catacomb, which should then be bricked up. The question of removing the bodies to a cemetery was agitated, but given up as impracticable. The only course that can be adopted is to close the entrances to all the vaults by impermeable brick-work, and to cut off the staircase communication between the body of the Church and the vaults. The Church-yard recommended to be planted with trees—the roots of which would absorb matter from the old Church-yard, and thus make what is now a nuisance ornamental and heathful. April, 1856.—The monthly report of the health of the district not quite so favorable. Measles frequent in some localities. Various parts of the Parish pointed out and improvements recommended. Suggestions to landlords to keep their houses in as good order as the common lodginghouses now are under the superintendence of the police. Insufficiency of the supply of water complained of in Bedfordbury, etc. Prince's Court pointed out as an opprobium to the Parish. Ivy Bridge Lane and others recommended to be flushed with water May, 1856.—Public health very favorable—no prevailing Epidemic. The docks in Scotland Yard 5 sented as full of filthy refuse injurious to health. A great nuisance exists here in loading barges with offal of the most offensive nature. The Courts, etc., abutting on Bedfordbury, described. many nuisances presented for abatement; the dilapidations and wretchedness of New Exchange Court, almost rendering the houses unfit for habitation. Houses and kitchens in Rose Street enumerated as requiring certain improvements. June, 1856—The number of deaths below the average. All the houses in Prince's Court shewn to require cleaning and repairing. The Adelphi Arches pointed out as requiring attention. The half-yearly report being printed in full, will not require further mention here. July, 1856.—Attention was called to the condition of Ivy Bridge Lane, and the necessity of public urinals, to prevent such places as this and the Adelphi Arches becoming nuisances. The necessity of adopting certain rides in relation to the licensing of slaughter-houses was pointed out. August, 1856.—The number of deaths during the month of July was 49, being below the average. Cases of diarrhoea more frequent, but not beyond the average for the season; the great majority being in children under 5 years of age. Several houses were reported as overcrowded, and insufficiently supplied with water and privy accommodation. Nuisance in the Adelphi Arches pointed out. September, 1856.—The number of births and deaths as shown by the tables were mentioned. The increased disease of the hot weather had subsided, and the health of London had returned to that remarkable condition which has characterised the whole year. Several underground dwellings and other nuisances were pointed out for attention. 6 September 22.—At the request of the Sewers Committee, the Officer of Health examined the condition of the lake in St. James's Park, and reported thereon. October, 1856.—The public health not so good as last month. The number of deaths were rather above the average. 16 out of 34 deaths occurred in children under three years of age. This large amount of infant mortality is among the poorest classes, and is to a great extent dependent on causes that are preventible. Overcrowded apartments, from the deterioration of the air, and a source of bad health, will be most deleterious to the youngest members of the family. Another cause of the great mortality of young children arises from the artificial food which is injudiciously administered to infants, being too often unsuitable both in quantity and quality. The medical officer reports on the condition of the Adelphi Arches—the roads, vaults, and cottages—and pointed out many of the evils of this place, moral as well as physical. November, 1856.—The number of deaths during October was 41, as seen by the tables. Several kitchens occupied as dwellings contrary to the rules laid down in the Metropolitan Management Act, and injurious to the health of the occupants, were reported. There are very few underground rooms that are not unwholesome, although many who have long lived in them assert that they have always enjoyed good health. This may be true as regards adults, but it is far otherwise with children; many die, and the others are generally weak, scrofulous, or ricketty. It is the young who always suffer most from ill-ventilated dwellings. Underground dwellings are not only injurious to health but degrading to human nature. They must always be somewhat damp, and are rarely free from smell, from the impossibility of free ventilation. 7 They are generally occupied by the Irish, who choose them because they are cheap, and by widows and orphans, who are compelled by necessity to live in them; but the result is to engender bad health, and increase poor rates by forcing their inmates to seek an asylum in the workhouse. In some instances underground places are occupied for the purpose of having a mangle, but there is no good reason why families of children should also sleep in them. Strong and healthy children cannot be brought up under such disadvantages. It is too much the custom for all classes to be careless in regard to the places where people sleep, as under the counters of shops, rendered unwholesome by the combustion of gas,; and it is not uncommon, even in the houses of the wealthy, to see places used for servants' bed-rooms which must endanger the health of those who sleep in them. Among nuisances complained of are the effluvia arising from the cookery carried on on a large scale in eating houses. Mr. Josiffe, in the Strand, has a hot plate, from which vapours escape through a skylight into an area open to the windows of the Albion Chambers, in the Adelphi. This is one of those trades which must be more or less a nuisance to neighbours from heat, steam, and the escape of the very offensive smells connected with some of the processes of cookery. We are justified in calling upon those who carry on such businesses to adopt all the means for ventilation that modern science affords. This is as necessary for the health of the parties themselves and their servants, as well as their neighbours; for nothing can be more fatal to health than breathing the atmosphere of a kitchen where extensive cooking is carried on. Mr. Josiffe has a large ventilating shaft from his kitchen to the top of his house, and with some modification it may be made to carry off all the effluvia now complained of. 8 My attention has been called to a cistern in Oxendon Street, into which coal gas is introduced from the water pipes. This is an increasing evil, and one I fear very difficult to remedy. November 20th, 1856.—Report made on the subject of the manufacture of Blacking, which is clearly a nuisance, although difficult to be proved injurious to health. December, 1856.—The number of deaths in November rather exceeded the average. This is to be imputed to the sudden invasion of a degree of cold unusual at this early period of winter. It is instructive to note the localities of deaths from epidemic diseases. I find that during the last month 3 deaths occurred in Bedfordbury, 2 in Chymister's Alley, 1 in Pipemaker's Alley, and 1 in Hop Gardens, all from hooping cough, while in the rest of the Parish only one death occurred from all these diseases. So in taking the deaths which occur among children under 5 years of age, the large majority occur in these overcrowded spots. Report for the Year ending Dec. 31st, 1856. —During the present year the number of deaths in the Parish of St. Martin was 598; in the year 1855, 625; in 1854, 624. The number of deaths in Charing Cross Hospital during 1856 was 77; in 1855, 73; in 1854, 77. The present year will, therefore, bear a favorable comparison with former years, although the death rate, deducting the deaths in the hospital, is nearly 22 in 1000. In former years the death-rate in St. Martin's was 24 in 1000; in the Strand Union, 27; in Holborn, 28; in St. George's Southwark, 30; in St. Saviour's, 38; while in Hampstead and St. George's, Hanover Square, it was only 18. So that in 7 years 1000 more persons die in St. Martin's than in Hampstead out of a corresponding amount of population. 9 The deaths from epidemic diseases have been 71. The fatality of these diseases—or as they are now termed, "Zymotic," apt to ferment; a kind of fermentation being supposed to produce the poison causing them—is indicative of the comparative unhealthiness of a district. In many instances where deaths from these diseases are reported, I have examined the premises, and as shewn in former reports, Bedfordbury and its courts are distinguished for the largest number of deaths from epidemics, as well as for great mortality among very young children. The activity of our Inspector of Nuisances has enabled me to report a considerable number for amendment, and I may congratulate the Vestry on our efforts having been successful in improving some of our worst localities—Pipemaker's Alley, Chymister's Alley, and other courts about Bedfordbury, New Exchange Court, etc., etc. Upon the whole I can state, from personal inspection, that the labouring class in our parish is much better lodged than in neighbouring districts. We have not many places exhibiting great destitution. One of the courts in Bedfordbury, Davy Place, may be cited as a model of cleanliness, and Broad Court, Duke's Court, and others, as examples of very tolerable comfort. However, there still remain some places in a very disgraceful state, as Prince's Court and Taylor's Buildings. The police have succeeded in reforming the casual lodging-houses by means of the "Act for the well ordering of Common Lodging-houses," by which it is incumbent on the keepers of these houses thoroughly to cleanse all the rooms, passages, stairs, floors, etc., and to lime-wash the walls and ceilings twice every year; it is surely not unfair to ask that all the houses let out in lodgings should be equally provided for. With regard to underground dwellings, I have heard statements of injury to property to result from 10 ference with them. I believe that if all kitchens, instead of being made separate tenements, were fitted up for the use of all the inhabitants of a house for washing and other domestic purposes, the loss of the rent of the kitchen would be compensated by a better class of tenants. The working classes are quite willing to make some sacrifice for cleanliness and comfort, and the habits of the dirtiest and most negligent are even made worse by having the choice of living in underground dwellings, many of which are unfit for human habitation, although in accordance with the clauses of the Metropolitan Management Act relating to kitchens. In former reports I have shewn that the proportion of deaths in children under five is greater than it ought to be. It is manifestly our duty to inquire whether this depends on local or more general causes, and whether it cannot be remedied. This great mortality among children occurs in all large towns, and always in the worst part of such towns. While a man, his wife, and three, four, even six children live in a single room containing space enough for only two persons— when you remember that this small place is the bedroom, the kitchen, and washhouse of the family, but also the water-closet—at least for the children—when we reflect what a woman with four or six children has to do, we can hardly be surprised that slops, offal, and worse matter remain in the room until the air is almost pestilential. Nor can we be surprised that when one of the children fall sick with measles, that a low kind of fever with inflamed lungs occurs, and that death ensues. I could point out several such cases in our small district within the last twelve months. But the evil does not rest here. The health of the mother becomes impaired, and she, too, falls a victim to the conditions under which we allow our people to live in all our large towns. The husband being called 11 out by his work breathes a better atmosphere for some part of the twenty-four hours, but too many sink under the ill effects of inhaling during a part of the day air so loaded with impurity: his strength failing, too often he has recourse to stimulants to enable him to counteract the effects of his own home, and he may fall a victim to some attack which, had his health not been thus deteriorated, he would easily have shook off. What do we see in the children who may have survived two or three of their number already carried to a premature grave ? The youngest, a baby of two or three months, has not yet suffered much from the unwholesome influences ready to receive it; the next, a child of two years, just able to crawl from chair to chair, with a very large head and very small limbs, the leg bones bent by incipient rickets, while the enlarged stomach and pasty face too truly indicate the certainty of chronic disease, threatening to render it a cripple or an invalid for life. Some of the first-born children may have stamina enough to get out into the world, but all with weak constitutions, unfit for the wear and tear of life, destined to fall among the victims of consumption or to drag on a very sickly existence, perhaps marrying and increasing by hereditary evils added to the others, a pauper and degraded population. It seems to me impossible to exaggerate the importance of the question of the public health; and I cannot separate the health of the mind from the health of the body. I feel confident that if the mental health of the people continues to deteriorate for another generation, the most fatal consequences must ensue. No doubt it is a difficult question, but we are all too much interested in it to give it up in despair. Our confidence in the moral order and government of the world, added to the blessings of enlightened Christianity, should make us zealous in our endeavours to raise to this 12 moral order larger masses of our fellow-creatures. This can only be effected by helping them in the first instance to more material comforts in their homes, and by teaching the coming generations the value of selfdependence, and the art of helping themselves in difficulties, by well-developed habits of thought and foresight. January, 1857.—The number of deaths for the month of January was 84, which is much beyond our average. It is caused by the return of a large number of deaths requiring inquests: these are not returned at the time of their occurrence, but are allowed to accumulate for months. I refer to the tables for the details of deaths, and to these will in future be added a table of prevailing diseases. Measles and hooping-cough are the most prevailing epidemics. The deaths from hooping-cough have been very numerous, and there can be no doubt that this disease is much more fatal than it ought to be, especially in poor localities; indeed, the principal mortality of the hooping-cough is among the children of the working-classes. In this disease it is a great point to keep a child in a room where the temperature is equable, especially at such a season as this, when inflammatory conditions of the lungs are apt to supervene. Unfortunately this is almost impossible where a family has only one room: hence the mortality of hoopingcough among the poor. I have often thought that no greater boon could be offered to the labouring classes than the establishment of a ward in all our workhouses for sick children. We may easily conceive the difficulties in such a family, with two or three children cast down with measles or hooping-cough, it often entailing distress and poverty from which it never recovers. February, 1857.—The number of deaths for the 13 four weeks ending February 28 was 58, which is above the average. The temperature in the early part of the month was very low, and, as usual, accompanied with considerable mortality from lung diseases. Hoopingcough continues to be unusually fatal. I would respectfully remind the Vestry that the question relating to kitchens has not been settled. Should an outbreak of cholera or other epidemic occur, and this is not improbable, seeing the very long continuance of a most healthy condition of the atmosphere; should any infectious disease attack the occupants of some of the underground dwellings in the Parish, we might justly be blamed for allowing families to live in some of these places. I do not wish to wage war against all kitchens as dwelling-places. Some are light, dry, and comfortable rooms, and many industrious people find them the most convenient residences ; but I do think it one of our most important duties to see that those which are fit for dwellings should be made as light, and kept as clean, as possible, and that the ventilation be particularly attended to. I can confidently assert my experience, that if we insist on a certain amount of cleanliness, we propagate some love for it, and that many of our working people only require to be encouraged by examples of order and cleanliness to adopt them. This is one of the most important advantages of the laws for the removal of nuisances ; many act wrong from ignorance only, and our periodical visitations are unmistakably beneficial in promoting improvement in the dwellings of the poor. I believe it would be beneficial to the pecuniary interest of all owners of houses let out in tenements, if they would adopt measures to keep their houses clean and wholesome, which is in many instances effected by making it the interest of one of the lodgers to look after these things, and give him 14 authority to turn away those who refused to be clean and orderly. Many are disgusted with the dirt and filth with which they aire obliged to associate, and would be glad of an opportunity of getting into well regulated lodging-houses. March, 1857.—The public health has improved during the month of March, and the weekly returns have all been below the average. Three deaths from fever have occurred; in two cases there is no imputation on the drainage, but in that which occurred at 2, Percy Wharf, there is a nuisance in the pipe of a water-closet that opens under the windows of the house above high water mark, so that it is only at spring tides that the accumulations can be carried away. Some observations on the supply of water to the Parish, which is principally from the New River. Our baths and washhouses are supplied from the Artesian Well in Orange Street. We have only two public pumps of spring water, that in Duncannon Street, from a well under the church, and the other behind King Charles's Statue at Charing Cross, which is supplied from the Orange Street Works. The quantity of water required for drinking purposes forms but a very small proportion of the total quantity consumed. The water we drink ought to be pure, fresh, and wholesome, which it never can be while supplied as at present from rivers into which towns carry their sewerage, whatever expense may be incurred for subsidence and filtering. That it is desirable to induce our population to drink more water and less beer and spirits all are agreed; but we ought to give them such water as there is pleasure in drinking,—that is, good spring water. To tell people that they should boil their water before drinking it is almost telling them not to drink water at all; and yet so small is the supply of really drinkable water, that several of our officers of health have been obliged 15 to give this advice; and most important advice it is when cholera is threatened or when diarrhœa much prevails, for there is no one fact more clearly proved than the increase of these diseases wherever impure water has been used; both at Newcastle and in St. James's Parish, in the last outbreak of cholera, the fatality would have been greatly diminished had no water been drank but that which had been boiled. We ought to recognise two kinds of water—one for internal and one for external use. It is surely absurd to use water that has been subjected to the expensive process of filtration for water-closets, street watering, and sewer flushing; for these and many common purposes, mere subsidence is sufficient, and the saving of money would have supplied all our population with wholesome drinking water. I believe that the Artesian Well in Orange Street would supply every house in St. James's and St. Martin's Parishes with from 30 to 50 gallons of its beautiful water daily, and that such an offer was made for ten shillings per house per annum; so that if we had recognised two kinds of water, one for internal use and one for common purposes, we should all have had a good supply of spring water for less money than the water companies have added to our former rates, from the enormous expenses they have been forced to incur. Yet are we still unprovided with drinkable water, and multitudes are not within a reasonable distance of a pump of pure spring water to rectify this monstrous evil. Lionel J.
