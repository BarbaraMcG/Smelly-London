The ground will then be paved at the cost of the Railway Company, as provided in the Act. IMPROVEMENTS. The premises No. 66, Three Colt Street, Limehouse, at the corner of Ropemaker's Fields, having come into the possession of the Board, and it being found impossible to let them, the Board directed that they should be put up for sale by auction, which was done. The premises were not sold, and the Board directed that they should be pulled down and the old materials sold by tender. The site has been cleared, and the front set back, so as to widen and improve that part of Three Colt Street. LIMEKILN CREEK, LIMEHOUSE. Complaints having been made by inhabitants of the locality to the Board respecting the nuisance arising from the accumulation of mud and deposit in the Creek, a communication was addressed to the Thames Conservancy Board requesting them to remove the accumulation. The Conservators have declined to do so, stating that the owners of the premises abutting on the Creek ought to remove the mud in front of their premises. The matter is under the consideration of the Works and Survey Committee. CAB RADIUS. The Board of Works for the Hackney District addressed a communication to the Board requesting them to take into consideration the question of the Cab Radius, which at present is confined to a circle of four miles from Charing Cross, and stating that, in the opinion of the Board, the time had arrived for the extension of the same to meet the requirements of the population of the Eastern and North Eastern Districts. A reply was sent to the Hackney Board stating that this Board would take part in any Conference appointed for the purpose of having the centre of the Radius altered to the Royal Exchange for Cabs going East and North East. RE-NAMING STREETS. The Metropolitan Board of Works made an order for re-naming "Albert Square," Shadwell, "Baroda Place," the new name has been put up. PREVENTION OF FLOODS. The Metropolitan Board of Works under the powers of the Metropolis Management (Thames River Prevention of Floods), Amendment Act, 1879, gave notice to the Board to raise the following stairs in the District to the altered height fixed by the Metropolitan Board after the high tide in January, 1881, namely, 5-ft. G-in. above Trinity high water mark.—In the Parish of Shad- well: King James Stairs, Cole Stairs, Pelican Stairs, Shad well Dock Stairs, and Bell Wharf Stairs. In the Parish of Wapping : Hermitage Stairs, Union Stairs, Wapping Old Stairs, Wapping New Stairs, Wapping Dock Stairs, and King Henry Stairs. The necessary works have been carried out as ordered by the Metropolitan Board. MAKING UP AND PAVING STREETS. Orders have been made upon the Owners of houses in Lee Street, and Kirks Place, in the Parish of Limehouse, for the payment of the apportioned expenses of Paving, and making up these streets and the works will be carried out upon the payment of the contributions. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES OF THE THAMES BELOW LONDON BRIDGE. The attention of the Board was called to the important question of forming a communication between the north and south sides of the River Thames below London Bridge for vehicular traffic. The matter was referred to the Works and Survey Committee who made a report thereon. In accordance therewith, invitations were sent to several of the Local Authorities at the East End of London asking them to appoint delegates to consider whether such accommodation is required, and if so, where the communication should be made. Delegates were appointed by certain of the Districts who passed a resolution that it was highly desirable that all the Local Authorities East of London Bridge should express their opinion upon the subject. In the meantime a plan was prepared by me of a Subway to form a communication between the Commercial Road East, and the Lower Road, Deptford, which was approved by the Board, and a copy was sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works and to the several Local Authorities at the East End. FISH MARKET ACCOMMODATION FOR THE METROPOLIS. This important question has again been brought before the Board. In 1868, the Court of Common Council of the City of London, advertised for sites for a Fish Market, when the subject of the inadequate accomodation at Billingsgate was under their consideration. The Board appointed a Committee which devoted much time in making enquiries and obtaining information from persons engaged in the Fish Trade, the result being that a petition was presented by the Board to the Court of Common Council praying that the Fish Market should not be removed from the Riverside to Farringdon Street, and that if it should be decided to remove Billingsgate, that the Fish Market should be established at Shad well near to the entrance of the London Docks, for reasons stated in the petition. The petitiQn was ordered to lie on the table. The Corporation in 1871 obtained powers from Parliament to enlarge Billingsgate, and the works were completed in 1877, at an expense of nearly <£300,000. In 1880, Mr. Spencer Walpole, Inspector of Fisheries, in accordance with the instructions of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, after taking evidence, made a report "on the destruction of Fish at Billingsgate in consequence of the alleged inadequate accommodation at Billingsgate." This report was sent to the Corporation, who appointed a Special Committee to consider the present unsatisfactory state of the Fish Supply of the Metropolis. The Committee held a public enquiry, at great expense, and examined many witnesses and reported that the railway rates operated prejudicially and restricted the supply of Fish to Billingsgate, that the approaches to that Market were insufficient and the area insufficient, that one wholesale Market was required and that the Market should be at the waterside, and that Billingsgate would be desirable for a waterside Market provided the site of the Custom House or the wharves adjoining could be obtained for the purpose of accommodating the vans and carts, &c. attending the Market. After much discussion the Corporation finally determined to ask Parliament for power to appropriate for an inland Fish Market, the building (nearly completed) of the Central Fruit and Vegetable Market at Farringdon Street, leaving the question of improving Billingsgate in abeyance. In June, 1881, the Metropolitan Board of Works had, at the instigation of the Home Secretary, taken up the question of the Fish Market accommodation of the Metropolis. The Board decided that Billingsgate Market was inadequate, that the deficiency of Market accommodation has a prejudicial effect in limiting the supply and increasing the price of an important article of food, and that the Board, if the necessary powers were granted, would lose no time in providing such additional Market, so as to afford a cheaper and more abundant fish supply to which the inhabitants of the Metropolis are entitled. Also that the authority given to the Corporation by Charter, in the reign of Edward III. is out of date and acts prejudicially to the interest of the 4,000,000 inhabitants of the Metropolis, and should by legislation be so altered as to give power for the establishment of Local Markets in any parts of the Metropolis for all kinds of food, whether animal or vegetable. The advantages of the Shadwell site and the necessity of providing additional waterside market accommodation were pressed upon the attention of the Metropolitan Board by the Board, and the Committee to which the matter had been referred recommended the Metropolitan Board to approve of a site in Blackfriars Road, between Southwark Street and Park Street, for a Fish Market, containing about 6½ acres, at an estimated cost of about £830,000. This report was rejected by the Board, which thus virtually confessed its inabilility to deal with the question, In the meantime a Committee had been appointed by your Board to confer with delegates from the Vestry of St. George's in the East and other Districts. The conference passed resolutions that the Market accomodation in the Metropolis was defective, and that the control of the markets should be vested in a body representing the whole Metropolis. The resolutions were sent to all the District Boards and Vestries, the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Corporation of the City of London, and the Home Secretary. My report and plan on the Shadwell site was also sent to the same authorities, and a petition was presented by me on behalf of your Board to the Court of Common Council in favour of the Shadwell site which was referred to the Fish Supply Committee. An important public meeting was held on the 11th October, 1881, at the Vestry Hall, St. George's East, in favour of the site. In November, 1881, I reported to your Board that in consequence of the adverse decisions of the Corporation and the Metropolitan Board of Works, I had had several interviews with Mr. Robert Hewett, the Managing Director of Hewett & Co., the well-known Fishing Company, and that he had decided at his own risk to make application to Parliament for powers to establish a waterside Fish Market at Shadwell, trusting to receive the support of the Local Authorities of the Metropolis, especially those of the East End. A Bill and Plans were accordingly prepared and duly deposited for powers to construct a Fish Market at Shadwell, with convenient approaches, and negociations are pending with the promoters as to the clauses to be inserted in the Bill for the protection of the District. The Bill was read a second time in the House of Commons on the 20th February, 1882. I am, Gentlemen Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1881. During that period there were registered in the district 2,176 births, 1,279 deaths, and 468 marriages. From the number of deaths must be deducted 109, which occured in the East London Hospital for Children, and were those of persons resident outside 2 the boundaries of your District. To the remainder must be added your proportion of the deaths of residents in your District, which occurred in Public Institutions outside it, viz., 258. Thus, 1,279 — 109 = 1,170 + 258 = 1,428, which represents the total mortality in your District during the year 1881. The numbers, both of Births and Deaths, were above the average of the last ten years, while the marriages were considerably below the average. The Birth rate for the year was 37 per 1,000, being a little more than 1 per 1,000 above the average of the last ten years. The Death rate was 24.3 per 1,000, for the year being .7 per 1,000 above the average of the last ten years. The Births registered in London in the year were at the rate of 34.7 per 1,000 persons living. The Deaths registered in London in the year were in the proportion of 21.2 to 1,000 inhabitants. Of every 100 deaths registered in the District, 23.2 were those of children under one year of age, being 3 per cent, less than the average number for the last ten years. The per-centage of deaths of Children under one year to registered births was 14.8. 3 Of the total deaths, 41.7 per cent, were those of children under 5 years of age, being 6.2 per cent, less than the average number for the last ten years. The proportion of deaths which belonged to your District, and were registered as having occurred in Public Institutions, was 258. Diseases of a Zymotic character caused the deaths of 283 persons, of which number, 194 were below the age of 5 years. Forty-two deaths were due to Smallpox, of which 12 occurred in the District; 27 in the Hospitals belonging to the Metropolitan Asylum District Board; and 3 in the Highgate Hospital. The annual average mortality from this disease during the last ten years, was 30.8. Of every 1,000 deaths registered, 29 were due to this disease. Two hundred and forty-six cases were reported to me, and they were spread over the year as follows:— January 11 cases. February 32 „ March 44 ,, April 29 „ May 27 „ June 29 „ July 9 cases. August 3 ,, September 14 ,, October 21 ,, November 18 ,, December 9 „ 4 Smallpox it will thus be seen was more or less prevalent during the whole of the year. Regarding it as I do as one of the most preventible of diseases, through vaccination, I cannot do otherwise than attribute its presence among us to the neglect of this precaution. The Vaccination Acts are now administered in the district with a zeal which bids fair to accomplish its object, but there are diffculties in the way as will be seen from the following report of the Vaccination Officer of the Stepney Union. This Officer states that during the year there were 2,204 Births registered in the Union ; of this number 1,870 children were successfully vaccinated, 183 died, 1 had Smallpox, 8 were postponed, 7 proved insusceptible, 25 were traced to other Unions and notices sent to the respective officers, 101 never resided at the addresses given, and 9 remain unvaccinated. In addition to these there were 576 successful vaccinations of children born previous to 1881. Now what has become of the 101 children who never resided at the addresses given 1 I fear they are lost for vaccination purposes, and if this is the number lost in the year out of 2,200 births registered in the Limehouse District, it follows that if the same rate be maintained over the whole of the metropolis more than 6,000 children escaped vaccination in London alone by the simple device on the part of the parent of giving a false address when registering the birth of a child. How many escaped vaccination by the avoidance of registration altogether it would be interesting to know. The possibility of the existence of such a state of things calls for, in my opinion, some amendment in the Registration Act. 5 Fifty two deaths resulted from Measles, a higher number than has been registered from this disease since 1877. The deaths from Measles were 10 above the decennial average. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 36 were due to this disease. Twenty-two deaths were registered from Scarlatina, being 25 below the annual average of the last ten years. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 15 were due to this disease. Forty-two cases were reported to me during the year. Eight deaths occurred from Diphtheria, being 3 above the annual average of the last ten years. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 6 were due to this disease. Forty-one deaths were due to Whooping Cough, being 13 below the annual average of the last ten years. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 29 were occasioned by this disease. Nineteen deaths were registered from Enteric Fever, 3 from Typhus, and 4 from Simple Continued Fever. Of these, 2 of Typhus and 2 of Enteric, occurred in a Fever Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylum District Board. Thirty-one cases of Enteric and 12 of Typhus were reported to me. The total number of deaths from these diseases was 26, being seven above the annual average of the last ten years. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 18 were due to these diseases. 6 Fifty-five deaths were due to Diarrhoea, being 8 below the annual average of the last ten years. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 39 were due to this disease. Thus to the seven principal Zymotic Diseases, viz., Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea, there were due 246 deaths, being 15 below the annual average of the last ten years; the death rate per 1,000 of the population from these causes was 4.2. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 172 were due to these diseases. Constitutional Diseases caused the deaths of 183 persons, of whom 73 were below the age of 5 years. Ten were due to Cancer, 39 to Tabes, 113 to Phthisis, and 15 to Hydrocephalus. Local Diseases were fatal to 549 persons, of whom 233 were below the age of 5 years. Forty-four deaths were due to Inflammation of the Brain, 29 to Apoplexy, 51 to Convulsions, 62 to Heart Disease, 154 to Bronchitis, 92 to Pneumonia, and 18 to Diseases of the Liver. Developmental Diseases caused a mortality of 116, of which number 71 died below the age of 5 years. Thirteen deaths were registered from Premature Birth, 15 from Teething, 38 from Old Age, and 38 from Atrophy and Debility. 7 Sixty-seven persons met their deaths from Violence, of which number 23 were below the age of 5 years. Ten deaths were registered from Fractures and Contusions, 28 from Drowning, 18 from Suffocation, while 8 persons committed Suicide. Pulmonary Diseases (other than Phthisis) caused the deaths of 263 persons, which number indicates a death rate of 4.5 per 1,000 of population from these diseases. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 184 were due to diseases of this class. Tubercular Diseases were fatal to 171 persons, indicating a death rate of 2.9 per 1,000 living. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 119 were due to these diseases. The Wasting Diseases of Infants caused 90 deaths, a number equivalent to a death rate of 1.5 per 1,000 living. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 63 were due to these diseases. The Convulsive Diseases of Infants caused 108 deaths, indicating a death rate of 1.8 per 1,000 of the population. Of every 1,000 deaths registered 75 were due to such diseases. Sanitary Work, &c. There were inspected during the year 1,670 houses and premises, of which number 1,336 required Sanitary Amendments ; 246 houses 8 and premises were cleansed and repaired, and 157 were disinfected after infectious diseases. One thousand three hundred and eighty complaints of accumulation of dust were received and attended to, while numerous house drains were repaired and trapped, various w.c.'s repaired and cleansed, new dust-bins provided, &c., and other matters of a like nature carried out, for a detailed list of which I beg to refer you to Table VI. The Disinfecting Ovens, belonging to the Board, were in frequent requisition, and nearly 8,000 articles, a detailed list of which will be found in the Appendix, were passed through them during the year. Besides the ordinary house to house visitation carried on by the Inspectors, various localities came under my special notice during the year, among which I may mention Londonstreet ; Elizabeth-court, Brook-street; Lower Shadwell; Kopemaker'sfields ; Angel-gardens ; Baroda-place ; Gloucester-court; Smith'splace ; and Nelson-court. These places are inhabited by the poorest of your district, and are consequently always in a wretched condition. Eopemaker's-fields was the subject of a representation by me to the Metropolitan Board of Works a year or two ago, under the Artizans* and Labourers' Dwellings' Act, 1875, but as the area was not dealt with, I reported upon it to your Board under the provisions of the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Act of 1868—79. Other places in your district are in a condition to be dealt with under these Acts, and will be reported to you during the present year. Angel-gardens 9 came under my notice, in consequence of an outbreak of Typhus Fever therein. The disease was imported from a neighbouring district, and for a time threatened seriously the health of the inhabitants of the locality. The measures, however, taken for stamping out the infection were entirely successful, early information of each case having been received, and the victims moved to Hospital without delay. In January, the low lying parts of your district were subjected to an inundation by the River. Occurring as it did during the depth of winter, the inhabitants of these parts suffered serious loss and inconveinence, as well as injury to health. The occurrence was the occasion of a letter from your Board to the Metropolitan Board of Works, asking that body to take steps under the Act of 1879. Your Board have had the watermen's stairs and other public places raised, and the Metropolitan Board of Works have taken steps to prevent a recurrence of a similar catastrophe. Smallpox Hospital accommodation came under your notice on several occasions ; in February a letter relating to this matter was received from the Local Government Board, in which your powers under 37 sec. of the Sanitary Act, 1866 were pointed out. Your Board, however, replied stating difficulties in the provision of separate accommodation for such cases, and drawing the attention of the Board to the popular demonstration against the Smallpox Hospital 10 in Dod-street a few years since. At the present time, cases that you are called upon to deal with are sent to the Smallpox Hospital, at Highgate, and a fee of four guineas paid with each. The whole matter requires grave and earnest consideration at the hands of the legislature and the local authorities. The present system is far from being a satisfactory one, in proof of which, I may state, that in April the Smallpox Hospital at Highgate, was full. In March, a conference of delegates from the Vestries and District Boards of London, was held at the Kensington Vestry Hall on the subject of the Compulsory Notification of infectious diseases; the object of the conference was to obtain (1) the compulsory disclosure to nuisance authorities of all cases of such dangerous infectious diseases as Smallpox, Scarlet Fever, &c. ; (2) an amendment of sec. 26 of Sanitary Act, 1866, so as to provide increased facilities for the removal to Hospitals of persons suffering from dangerous infectious diseases, and being without proper lodging and accomodation, enabling them to be properly isolated at home ; and lastly, an enactment for depauperising the relief afforded by way of maintenance, medical treatment, &c. to persons removed for the purpose of isolation to infectious disease hospitals, and for making the support of all such hospitals in the Metropolis, a charge on the Metropolitan common poor fund. In company with the delegates from your Board I attended this Conference, when resolutions in favour of the above objects were passed, and it was 11 further resolved to take steps for bringing the matter to the notice of the Government. A deputation having been appointed, it was received in April, by the President of the Local Government Board, who promised the matter his attention. In June, I attended and gave evidence before a Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to enquire into the working of the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Acts. The The Report of the Committee is now published and will well repay perusal. The offensive odours arising from the ventilating shafts of the sewers were a frequent cause of complaint during the year. It having come to the knowledge of the Board that an arrangement existed in Hanbury Street, Whitechapel, whereby the nuisance was to a considerable extent abated, the Surveyor and I were directed by your Board to make enquiries regarding it. We found that the emanations from the sewer were conveyed through a pipe fixed to the side of a house and carried above the roof; an upward draught was maintained by a lighted gas jet in the course of the pipe, about the level of an ordinary gas lamp, for which, by having glass inserted in the pipe opposite the flame, it did duty. On our joint report, your Board resolved to request the Metropolitan Board of Works to try a similar experiment at the Triangle, Limehouse. It is time, and more than time that something was done to remedy the nuisance, the evil effects of which it is difficult to over-estimate. 12 On representations made by mo, your Board passed a resolution in June to the effect that the contractors should be required to provide covers to their dust-carts to prevent the contents thereof blowing about in windy weather, and from being spilled during transit. So far as I am aware nothing has yet been done in this direction. The Limehouse Cut came under my notice in July, in consequence of the cleaning out of the same ; the stench was abominable, and several cases of sore throat, caused, I have no doubt, by the malific exhalations from the mud, occurred in houses situated on the banks of the Cut. A communication was sent by your Board to the Conservators of the Lea, to which they replied regretting the occurrence and promising greater care in the future. The deterioration of water in impure cisterns occupied your attention, and the inspectors were instructed to make special inspections of the water receptacles, and report thereon. This work was a very necessary one, as the water-cistern is frequently the receptacle of matter other than water. I have seen decayed animal and vegetable matter in the water-butt, together with living animalculse, not to mention brickbats and broken crockery. In addition to these matters, the water is liable to become contaminated by noxious vapours from untrapped drains and closets and emanations 13 from factories. Under these circumstances the inspection, and the subsequent remedying of the defects, were urgently necessary. It is, however, an inspection that must be continuous to be of any value. The condition of the River, in the neighbourhood of the sewer outfall at Crossness and Barking, was the subject of a communication from the provisional Committee for the prevention of the loAver Thames from pollution by sewage. Your Board, recognizing the importance of the subject, directed me to make an inspection of the River in the localities mentioned, and to report thereon. The inspection having been made, and the water taken from the River at these spots analyzed, the fact was revealed that the River at Crossness and Barking is largely contaminated with sewage matter. Nobody who knew the vast quantity of sewage discharged daily into the River at these points could have anticipated any other result; but the subject derives additional interest when we consider that as London grows so will the quantity of sewage discharged increase. We are face to face with a tremendous and a growing evil, which, if not checked, will do much to injure the health and prosperity of this ancient Port. Your Board resolved to give its assistance to any scheme which had for its object the removal of the sewage further towards the sea. 14 Cow and Slaughter Houses. These structures were inspected by me before the day of licensing, and the defects discovered having been remedied, licences were granted to those named in the list of licencees in the Appendix. Canal Boats' Act. In January I examined and reported to your Board the condition of the Canal Boat, Nelson, belonging to Mr. Dodd, of City Road Wharf. On my report the Boat was registered under the provisions of the Act. Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. Eighty-two samples of Food, Drink and Drugs were examined at the Board's Laboratory. Of these, 20 were Milks, of which 4 were adulterated with varying proportions of water. Nine were Butters, of which 3 were adulterated with fat other than Butter. Seven Coffees were examined, of which 1 was adulterated with Chicory. The remaining articles examined were Tea, Bread, Paregoric, Cream of Tartar, Tartaric Acid, Fluid Magnesia, Tincture of Rhubarb, Pepper, Cocoa, and powdered Loaf Sugar, all of which were found to be genuine, and of the quality desired. 15 Meteorology. The mean temperature of the air during the year was 48.7° F. ; the mean of the 1st quarter having been 37.3°, of the 2nd 52.9°, of the 3rd 60°, and of the 4th 44.6° ; the mean height of the Barometer was 29.778 inches ; the rain fall amounted to 25.24 inches, 5.43 inches having fallen in the 1st quarter, 4.10 in the 2nd, 8.19 in the 3rd, and 7.52 in the 4th. Rain fell on 154 days. Water Supply. The East London Water Company supplies the greater portion of your district, a small portion only being supplied by the New River Company. Regarding these sources of supply, Professor Frankland says in his Report on the Analyses of the Waters supplied by the Metropolitan Water Companies during 1881—"The Water drawn from the Lea was throughout the greater part of the year considerably less polluted than that derived from the Thames; the New River Company's supply being, as a rule, of superior quality to any of the Thames Waters, whilst that of the East London Company usually ranked with the better classes of Thames Water. Indeed, this Company occasionally abstracts a portion of its supply from the Thames at Sunbury. In January and February, however, the Water supplied by these Companies was of very inferior quality, as was that supplied by the East London Company in March." 16 In concluding this Report, I feel it due to the Inspectors to state that they have carried out my instructions and performed their duties to my entire satisfaction.
