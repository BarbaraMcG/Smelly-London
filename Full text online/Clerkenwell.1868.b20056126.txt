To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, The time has now arrived at which it becomes my duty to lay before you the usual Sanitary Report for the past year (1868), forming the Thirteenth of those which I have had the honor of presenting to you. The number of deaths which occurred from all causes in the year, was 1644. The average number of deaths for the last Twelve years, was 1530; hence the deaths were 114 more than the average. In the subjoined table, the numbers of deaths which have occurred in each of the last twelve years, are stated in order; the numbers of births for the same years being appended. It will be readily seen, that the number of births is 153 more than the average, and 26 more than in the preceding year:— Deaths. Births. In 1857 1406 2219. 1858 1477 2220. 1859 1374 2175. 1860 1383 2279. 1861 1494 2295. 1862 1572 2287. 1863 1509 2449. 1864 1735 2224. 1865 1613 2389. 1866 1661 2434. 1867 1497 2452. 1868 1644 2478. Average 1530 2325. The next table shows the respective districts in which the deaths and births occurred. Deaths. Births. St. James 628 771. Amwell 354 600. Pentonville 286 464. Goswell 376 643. 13 In each year, a certain number of deaths of members of this parish occurs in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The number of these estimated for 1868 is 118. As the number of deaths in 1867 was 1497., that for 1868 was 147 more than in the preceding year. The excess of births over the deaths, or the natural increase of population, amounts to 834; in the preceding year this sum was 955. The number of deaths which took place from all the zymotic diseases in 1868, was 439; while that arising1 from the principal of these maladies, was 394. The numbers and kinds of the latter are exhibited as taking place during the last 12 years in the subjoined table:— Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Typhus. In Fever Hospital. Totals. 1857 6 51 42 84 65 47 + 9 295 1858 5 69 64 61 55 31 + 8 285 1859 9 24 82 87 68 31 + 6 301 1860 10 39 50 62 38 27 + 5 226 1861 0 22 95 107 72 44 + 17 340 1862 1 76 133 53 42 70 + 9 375 1863 26 44 136 66 52 42 + 8 376 1864 7 73 94 71 87 46 + 9 378 1865 12 27 57 88 84 48 + 5 316 1866 6 42 59 95 93 47 + 4 342 1867 20 44 49 35 71 50 269 1868 4 58 106 69 112 45 394 14 The average number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases for the last twelve years is 324; so that the number for 1868 is 70 above the average. The number of deaths from all causes which took place in infants and children, under five years of age, was 793. The corresponding numbers for the last eleven years having been 663, 656, 628, 624, 707, 724, 728, 789, 700, 736, and 663; the average being 692; so that these deaths were 101 above the average, and 130 more than in the preceding year. 303 deaths occurred at and above 60, including 52 at and above 80 ; these numbers in the preceding year were 331 and 44. 265 deaths arose from pulmonary diseases, the number for 1867 being 289. The number of deaths in the Workhouse was 178; the numbers for the last nine years having been 120, 137, 160, 172, 158, 167, 174, 156, and 186. 26 deaths took place in Corporation Buildings, being nearly twice the number of the preceding year, viz. : 14. 23 deaths of prisoners occurred in the House of Correction, viz.: 2 from bronchitis, 3 from paralysis, 9 from consumption, 5 from inflammation of the lungs, 2 from typhus, 1 from heart disease, and 1 from accident. 3 deaths took place in the House of Detention; two of them in prisoners. The numbers of deaths in the prisons in the preceding year were 32 and 5 respectively. The accidental deaths were 23, viz.: 7 from fractures and contusions, 3 from burns and scalds; 12 from suffocation, and 1 from being run over by a cab. 2 deaths arose from murder; and 6 from suicide, viz.: 2 from poison, 1 from drowning, and 3 from hanging. 85 inquests were held in the year, including the 25 upon the prisoners in the Houses of Correction and Detention. Further particulars of the deaths, according to the causes and ages, will be found in the table appended to this report. It is thus evident that I cannot report so favorable a state of the mortality of the parish for the past year, as I was able to do in regard to that of the preceding year, 1867. 15 If we subtract the number of zymotic deaths in 1867 (292), from the total number of deaths from all causes (1497), we have left 1205; if this is also done in the case of the year 1868, the zymotic deaths being 439, and the total number 1644, we have the same residue. This shows that the excess of mortality depends upon an increase in the number of zymotic deaths. These diseases are admitted at all hands to be such as are most amenable to sanitary conditions; hence an increase of them would tend to show that these conditions have become more unfavourable. As the increase has taken place within a year, it might be expected that some sudden change had occurred in the sanitary state of the parish. This has not been the case, although there can be no doubt that the overcrowding and occupation of single rooms by families is on the increase. The population has certainly increased since the last census, as indicated by the larger number of births. And an increase of population brings the inhabitants more closely into contact, so that the infectious zymotic diseases spread very extensively, and thus become more fatal. If we subtract the number of deaths occurring in 1867 in infants and children under five (663), from the total number of deaths (1497), we obtain a residue (834), representing the mortality of the older portion of the population. On doing the same for the year 1868, in which the deaths under five were 793, the total deaths being 1644, we have a residue of 851; differing from that of the former year by only 17. Hence the difference between the mortality of the two years consists in an excess of zymotic mortality, occurring at ages under five years. On referring to the table at p. 13, it will be seen that the principal increase has occurred in the deaths from Scarlet Fever and infantile diarrhoea, which prevailed most extensively during the summer months, the season, it will be remembered, having been very dry and hot. In the 26th and 6 following weeks, the mortality from zymotic diseases, principally Scarlet Fever and infantile diarrhoea, was extremely great; the numbers being 14, 18, 13, 20, 17, 10, and 17. Subsequently they gradually declined. 16 The greatest sanitary evil we have to do with, is the occupation of single rooms by entire families. Perhaps the next is, the mothers being so frequently compelled to bring up their children "by hand either because they are obliged to go out to work, or because they have become so lowered in health by confinement in ill ventilated rooms, and want of open-air exercise, that the maternal supply of food for the infants is wanting. The too early artificial feeding, and the confinement to small over-crowded rooms, where cooking, washing and sleeping all take place, are the main causes of infantile diarrhoea. It will be noticed that the deaths from Small Pox are reduced from 20 to 4. Although no Vaccination Inspector was appointed, the notices were sent out, during a considerable portion of the year at least, by the energetic clerk to the Guardians, and undoubtedly with good effect. Slaugllter-liouses. These were inspected as usual by the Sanitary Committee and myself. They were 37 in number, kept by 36 butchers. Any defects found were ordered to be remedied. Cow-lioiiflcs. These wero also duly inspected. They were 29, kept by 27 cow-keepers; the number of cows being 390. This is an increase of 120 over the preceding year. It may be well to notice, that the expression has been made by the magistrates, that sooner or later all cow-houses and slaughterhouses within 50 feet of inhabited dwellings will have to be abolished. It may be noted, that in one Metropolitan District—Whitechapel— Professor Simonds, of the Royal Veterinary College (the Government Inspector of Cattle), was engaged by the Vestry to examine and report upon the adaptability, &c., of the cow-houses to the cows, so as to lay down the law upon the matter. I believe that a similar proceeding would be beneficial in this parish. In one of Professor Simonds' notices, it is stated, "that the dung-pit should be partly filled in, so that no accumulation of dung should take place. The pit also requires a better lid." In many instances in this parish, if the pits were partly filled up and provided with lids, a great deal of the annoyance now complained of by the inhabitants would be removed. Bake-houses. These were also inspected as usual by the Sanitary Committee and myself. They were 67 in number. Careful investigation was made to ascertain that the terms of the Bakehouse Regulation Act were complied with. 17 The Meteorology of the year was as follows: 1868. Temperature, moun. Difference from mean of 97 yean. Dew Point. Humidity (Saturation=100.) Height of Barometer. Bain in inches. Difference from average of 53 years. Year 51.6 + 31 44.8 78 29.78 25.2 0.1 Winter Quarter (Jan., Feb., Mar.) 41.4 + 2.9 36.3 82 29.84 6.6 + 1.6 Spring Quarter (April, May, June.) 55.8 + 3.6 47.1 73 29.86 4.3 1.6 Summer Quarter (July, Aug., Sept.) 63.9 + 4.3 53.8 70 29.77 5.1 —2.5 Autumn Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec) 45.1 + 1.4 41.7 88 29.66 9.2 + 2.1 Hence the temperature of the year was somewhat above the average, that of the spring and summer being considerably so. The rain-fall for the whole year was about the average, the excess in the winter and autumn quarters making up the deficiency in the spring and summer quarters. Sanitary Improvements. These were as follows during the year: 212 feet of 9-inch pipe-sewer were laid down; and 160 feet of 12.inch; 27 sewers were cleansed and 5 repaired; 5 new gullies were constructed, 18 trapped, 12 repaired, and 152 cleansed; 48 houses were drained; 12 cesspools destroyed and water-closets substituted for them; 73 loads of soil were removed from the sewers and the gullies; and one public urinal erected. During the year, several lots of fish, plucks, and meat, in a state unfit for food, were seized and destroyed, under a magistrate's order; and in one instance, two of the salesmen were sent to the House of Correction for a month. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, October, 1869. J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D. DEATHS REGISTERED IN CLERKENWELL IN 1868.
