PREVALENCE AM) CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. Scarlet Fever. The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 24, giving an incidence rate of 0.53 per thousand population. All the cases were very mild Diphtheria. For the eleventh year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Immunisation against diphtheria progresses smoothly. Special efforts continue to be made to encourage mothers to bring their babies for immunisation in those cases where persuasion by the health visitor has failed. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme. This has resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year:- Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 395, school 130) 525 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 373 Although diphtheria is no longer a serious public health problem it must be remembered that the disease is still present and that any relaxation of the immunisation campaign could have serious re suit s. Immunisation not only prevents many children from contracting diphtheria, but greatly mitigates the severity of the illness if a child should fall a victim to this disease. Whooping Cough. The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 9. No deaths occurred. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. It is to be hoped that whooping cough immunisation will prove as effective as immunisation against diphtheria. 9. As whooping cough is most dangerous in the first year of life immunisation should be commenced at the third or fourth month. Details of the number of children immunised against whooping cough during the year are as follows Number of children immunised 384 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 108 Vaccinations. The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced due to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate times. The percentage of infants under 1 year vaccinated in this Borough during the year was 74.2$ and efforts are being made to increase this figure. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccinations. During the year the following were performed:- Vaccinations 445 Revaccinations 69 514 Of the above, 217 individuals were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners. 394 of the persons vaccinated were -under one year of age. Acute Poliomyelitis. One case of acute poliomyelitis (paralytic) occurred during the year. This child, aged 2 years, had severe paralysis of the right leg but is improving satisfactorily under treatment. Immunisation against this disease continued throughout the year. Measles. The number of cases of measles notified (359) was lower than in 1957. No deaths occurred. 10. Scabies and Verminous Conditions. Necessary action for these conditions has been very limited and calls for no special comment. 26 cases of the mild sonne dysentery occurred. This condition is highly infectious among young children and its incidence has been increasing during the past few years throughout the country. There was an outbreak of food poisoning at a residential institution when 65 persons out of the total 220 staff and students were affected. An immediate detailed investigation was carried out and it was found that some of the tinned beans which had been consumed at lunch were infected with staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive organisms. The Medical Officer of Health of the district where the beans were canned instigated a thorough investigation into the processing of the beans and the manufacture of the cans. As the result of the bacteriological examinations both here and in the factory and air pressure tests to the cans, it was established that the infection arose from contamination of the beans due to a fault in construction of the cans and as a consequence, those which are now used are stronger with more folds in the ends to allow for expansion. There were 9 single cases of food poisoning, all due to salmonella typhi-murium. Dysentery. Food Poisoning *Cases removed to Isolation Hospitals.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR 1958 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. June, 1959. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my 6th annual report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year. The Clean Air Act, 1956, which came into full operation during the year, is the strongest piece of legislation ever put on the statute book to deal with atmospheric pollution. For the first time power has been given to local authorities to deal with the question of domestic smoke. The Committee on Air Pollution made the following observations: "We have made it clear that much can be done to reduce industrial smoke. But nearly half of all the smoke in the air comes from domestic chimneys. The proportion is greater in areas where houses predominate. Further, most of the domestic smoke is produced during the winter months when foggy conditions are most likely to occur. Although the smoke from domestic chimneys is less dense than that from industrial chimneys, it is discharged at a low level and its harmful effects are thereby accentuated. No cure can, therefore, be found for the heavy smoke pollution of our cities and towns unless the domestic chimney is dealt with. In our view there would be little justification for requiring industry and commerce to take all possible measures to prevent smoke, often at considerable cost, if the problem of domestic smoke were not also tackled". This is a mainly residential area which suffers from 'smog'. As mentioned in my report, the Council will be giving further consideration to smoke control areas in November, 1959. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, S. J. T. WOOD. Chief Public Health Inspector. 16. HOUSING. The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year- (a) by the Council 24 (b) by private enterprise 61 Number of houses in course of construction- (a) by the Council 41 (b) by private enterprise 119 For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served- Preliminary 36 Abatement 15 These figures do not include verbal notices often given with regard to minor matters. HOUSING ACT, 1949. - IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. Applications for improvement grants for the conversion and modernisation of older properties are considered by the Council. These grants were made tinder the provisions of the Housing Act, 1949, as amended by the Housing Repairs and Rent Act, 1954, and the Rent Act, 1957. These provisions were consolidated in the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958, which came into operation on the 23rd October, 1958. Many enquiries were made and advice given about the availability of grants and the following table shows the grants approved during the year. Dwellings to be provided by CONVERSION.

The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. One water sample was taken on receipt of a complaint, the report on which was satisfactory. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The following numbers of rooms were disinfected for the undermentioned causes:- Tuberculosis 5 Poliomyelitis or suspected poliomyelitis 3 Other 22 18.

Starch Reduced Bread. An informal sample was submitted to the public analyst who reported that in his opinion the percentage reduction in starch was so insignificant that it was misleading to describe the bread as starch reduced. Representations were made to the bakery company concerned who agreed to withdraw all claims to the term 'starch reduced' as applicable to this bread. Clean Mixed Fruit. An informal sample was submitted to the public analyst who reported that it contained an excess of sand and earthy matter and was not suitable for use without prior washing. The importer agreed to alter his labelling and omit the word 'clean'. Vienna Sausages. An informal sample of a tin of Vienna Sausages was submitted to the public analyst who reported that as tripe was the major ingredient and not pork, these sausages were not entitled to the description 'Vienna Sausages'. This was an imported product and after considerable correspondence the manufacturers agreed to omit the word 'Vienna' from the label. 21 . MILK. During the year the following licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designations)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, or the Milk (Special Designations)(Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 - 1954. Dealers. Tuberculin tested 9 Pasteurised 10 Sterilised 13 Supplementary. Tuberculin tested 10 Pasteurised 10 Sterilised 11 The difference between a dealer's and a supplementary licence is that, if a dairyman has premises in a local government area where he retails milk he is issued with a dealer's licence. Should he retail milk in another area he must obtain a supplementary licence from the Council of that area. DETAILS OP MILK TESTING. CLASS OP MILK. NUMBER OP SAMPLES TESTED APPROPRIATE TESTS NUMBER OP SAMPLES PASSED FAILED Pasteurised 66 Phosphatase 66 - Methylene blue 66 - Sterilised 5 Turbidity 5 - Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 47 Phosphatase 47 - Methylene blue 47 - Tuberculin tested (Farm Bottled) 3 Biological 3 - The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. 22. The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. Farm bottled (tuberculin tested) milk is not pasteurised and is retailed without treatment. It is pleasing to record that all milk samples taken during the year passed the appropriate tests. FOOD. There are no slaughter houses or knackers' yards in the Borough. The following table lists the food premises in the district by type of business. Food Premises No. in District No. of Inspections Made Bakehouses 5 16 Bakers shops 15 29 Butchers 21 38 Confectioners 30 25 Cooked meat shops 1 3 Fish shops (wet or fried) 12 26 Greengrocers 25 29 Greengrocers stalls 1 4 Grocers (including off-licences). 55 100 Institutions 16 29 Milk depots 2 5 Milk shops 5 10 Office and works canteens 16 17 Public houses and hotels 12 16 Restaurants and cafes 15 50 School canteens 11 20 Sports clubs 15 21 257 438 The following premises are registered under Section 16 of the Food aral Drugs Act, 1955, for the purposes listed. 23.

The following unfit foodstuffs were voluntarily surrendered and destroyed or salvaged:- Corned beef 114 lbs. Luncheon meat 52 lbs. Pig livers 20 lbs. Lamb 104 lbs. Bacon 374 lbs. Beef steak 2 lbs. Beef 82 lbs. Pork 18 lbs. Cooked ham 37 lbs. Assorted tinned food 9 cwt. Potatoes 56 lbs. Tinned fruit 94 lbs. POOD COMPLAINTS. Certain of the food complaints were of interest. Bread. A complaint was received that a loaf of bread contained foreign matter. The report of the public analyst showed that a small quantity of brown flour or wholemeal dough had been incorporated with the white flour dough and had been cooked within the loaf. Bread. A complaint was received of an alleged piece of glass in a loaf of bread. On examination this proved not to be glass but a piece of celluloid which was found to be a piece broken off a price ticket. A warning letter was sent to the Company concerned. Bread. Complaint was received of foreign matter in a loaf of bread. This proved to be edible oil containing a little iron picked up from the dividers. A warning letter was sent to the manufacturers. 24. Grapefruit. A complaint was received of glass in a tin of grapefruit. The alleged glass proved to be harmless natural crystals of naringen. Orange Drink. A complaint was received alleging that a bottle of orange drink tasted bad. A sample was submitted to the Public Health Laboratory and also the Public Analyst. The reports were satisfactory. The Public Analyst made the comment that this type of drink is made from whole oranges and prepared by comminuting and macerating the complete orange whereby extracts and flavouring from the peel as well as the juice of the orange are included in the drink. This process gives such drinks a flavour different from that of the traditional orange squash. Although the flavour of whole orange drinks are preferred by some, other people do find them objectionable. ICE CREAM. Fifty-six samples were submitted to the methylene blue test and all were placed in grade I. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended: "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade I, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV". The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947: Year Samples Taken Grades I or II % Grade III % Grade IV % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 0 - 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 0 - 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 0 - 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 1956 52 48 92.3 4 7.7 0 - 1957 54 54 100.0 0 - 0 - 1958 56 56 100.0 0 - 0 - It is pleasing to note that for the first time all samples reached the high standard of grade I. 25. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT. As the Council appoints an analyst for the purposes of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, they may execute any of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act other than those relating to importation, so far as relates to any foodstuff to which an Order in Council under the Act applies. These are administered by my department. Inspections were made but it was not necessary to take any action during the year. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT. 1952. This Act is to ensure that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year but in all cases the appliances inspected were satisfactory. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. One sample was submitted to the Prescribed Analyst who gave a satisfactory report. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications for renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted: SHOPS ACT. 1950. There are 371 shops in the Borough and inspections are made in connection with provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which are concerned with sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation. Where plans are submitted of new construction or alteration to shop premises, due consideration is given to ensure that the proposals comply with the provisions of the Act. The Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the administration of the law relating to shop hours, including early closing and Sunday trading. 26. 220 inspections were made during the year which revealed that the arrangements made for the health and comfort of shop workers were in the majority of cases satisfactory. Most of the necessary action taken was in connection with the exhibiting of notices and the sale from shops of prohibited goods on the early closing day and Sunday mornings. REFUSE TIP. The Council approved the tipping of clinker and screenings by the Carshalton and the Merton and Morden Urban District Councils from the 31 st March, 1956, on a site at the rear of Brook County Primary School, Green Lane, Worcester Park. This approval was given subject to precise conditions and tipping started in July, 1957, and has proceeded steadily since that date. The site has been visited frequently and no nuisance has occurred. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Certain sections of the Clean Air Act, 1956, came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, and the remainder came into operation on the 1st June, 1958. The Council has adopted the model byelaws under Section 24 of the Act stipulating that in a new building only such appliances designed to burn smokeless fuels are installed for heating or cooking. Consideration of any action in connection with the making of smoke control areas was deferred until. November, 1959. During the year 76 visits were made in connection with smoke abatement. Equipment consisting of daily smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus was installed and has operated since the 1st October, 1957. The following tables show the daily average, and highest and lowest concentrations of smoke expressed in milligrammes per 100 cubic metres and sulphur dioxide concentration as parts per 100 million volumes of air SMOKE. 1957 1958 OCT.

RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The obligations of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, have been fully met. The work of rats and mice destruction continues on a well organised basis, providing a free service to householders and making appropriate charges in the case of business premises, many of which are on annual service agreements. The Council depots, sewage disposal works, refuse tip, piggeries and open spaces have received constant attention. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood require as one of their conditions of 'Grant' that the soil sewer system shall be subjected to an annual 10% test baiting and any infestation found subjected to initial and maintenance treatments. 292 sewer manholes were test baited and in only one section of the system was it necessary for initial and maintenance treatment to be carried out. Constant liaison is maintained with officers of the infestation division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. I have always found them most helpful and co-operative. Workable Area Committee meetings are held from time to time at which difficulties and new methods of rodent control are discussed. INSECT PESTS. As in previous years the department was able to be of assistance by giving advice and help to members of the public who suffered inconvenience from insect pests. The carpet beetle, clover mite and ant proved to be most troublesome. Only four rooms were treated for infestations of bugs. Sixteen council houses were inspected for evidence of vermin. Requests were received from a number of householders for assistance in the destruction of wasps nests. Some nests were destroyed and other requests were declined where the nests were found to be in positions not causing real inconvenience. By arrangement with the Surrey County Council six school kitchens and canteens were sprayed with a residual insecticide as a deterrent against insect infestation. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it was not necfessary during the year to arrange any burials. CARAVANS. There are no caravan sites in the Borough. Licences were granted to station two moveable dwellings in the area. 29. PUBLIC SEWERS. Stoppages in public sewers (combined drains) were cleared by the department on two hundred and twenty-nine occasions. In a few instances the assistance of sewermen from the Borough Engineer's department had to be obtained. RAINFALL, 1958.
