Public Health Department Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my report for the year 1924. The year was characterised by a cool and wet summer, and the deaths from Diarrhasa showed a considerable decline. The general health of the Borough has been good, no cases of Small-pox occurred but there was a continuance of the epidemic of Measles from the previous year, with 77 deaths. The Birth Rate for the Borough was 22.5 as against 24.3 for 1923, the Death Rate was 14.2 as against 12.8 in 1923, and the Infantile Mortality Rate 71 per 1,000 births as against 68 in 1923. There was a slight increase in the deaths from Scarlet Fever. but the deaths from Diphtheria were the same as in the previous year, there was also a slight increase in the deaths from Influenza. Encephalitis Lethargica increased considerably, 31 cases being notified with 9 deaths. Owing to deaths, sickness and changes in the staff of the Department the work has been carried on under considerable difficulty, but in spite of being shorthanded the staff has worked well to make up the deficiencies. I have in regard to this matter to report the death during the year of Mr. Jenkinson, Sanitary Inspector, and E. Knock, Disinfector, the lengthy illness of Mr. Bradshaw and the resignation of Mr. Dove. Mr. Green was appointed Mortuary Keeper at Colliers Rents Mortuary and Coroner's Court in place of Mr. Clark, deceased. The Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme is progressing well, and no changes in its general administration have taken place nor any changes in staff. There has been a large decline in the amount of free milk given away. The Tuberculosis Dispensary is now under the charge of Dr. J. T. Crowe, who entered on his duties in April, and a full report of the work done will be found in his appended report. The staff remains the same. 2 Electric Light has been installed in the cleansing station, and the hot water supply carried to the Men's bathroom in place of the old geyser, and many other repairs have been carried out. Overcrowding is still the outstanding feature of the Borough, which has not sufficient accommodation for all its inhabitants. There was a steady increase in the work necessitated by the Imported Food Regulations. During the year I examined 444 men, chiefly from the Labour Bureau as to their suitability for employment under the Borough Council. I have to thank the Council, the Public Health Committee, and the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee for their support and courtesy. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, HORACE WILSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Southwark. 3 PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS TO WHOSE SALARY CONTRIBUTION IS MADE.

Estimated population (1924) 187,714 Area (acres) 1,131 Number of inhabited houses (1924) 20,474 Number of families or separate occupiers (Census) 46,727 Rateable value £1,250,047 Sum represented by penny rate £5,100 2 —EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR.

Number of women dying in, or in consequence of childbirth — From sepsis 2 Other causes 7 Deaths of infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 births, 71.

Diarrhæa under 2 years of age 44 5 POPULATION During the year 1924 the estimated population as supplied by the Registrar-General has increased by 250, being 187,714 as against 187,464 in the previous year. All the rates in my report are calculated on the former figure, and the General and Vital Statistics cover a period of 53 weeks instead of the usual 52 weeks. This is in compliance with the request of the Registrar General, who has calculated the year to end on the 3rd January, 1925. It will be seen from the subjoined table that the greater increase in population has taken place in the Newington District, with a lesser increase in Christchurch and St. Saviour's Wards, whilst St. George's District shows a slight decrease. The total increase of 250 persons in this already congested Borough does not tend to abate the overcrowding which is one of its outstanding features. The Bye-laws in regard to Houses Let in Lodgings foreshadowed in last year's report have not yet materialised, and these matters are still in abeyance. The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1922, 1923 and 1924 are as follows:— Newington. St. George's. St. Saviour's and Christchurch. 1841 54,693 — — 1851 64,816 51,824 35,731 1861 82,157 55,510 36,169 1871 88,691 56,083 31,294 1881 107,831 58,652 31,628 1891 115,663 59,740 27,116 1901 121,863 60,998 23,319 1911 116,819 55,782 19,316 1921 114,987 52,114 17,303 1922 116,683 52,996 17,541 1923 117,200 52,690 17,574 1924 117,500 52,610 17,604 6 The Ward distribution was as follows:— TABLE 1.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1924 was 3,641, of which 1,859 were males, and 1,782 females. This represents a birth-rate of 19-4 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 2,227; St. George the Martyr, 1,003; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 411. Of the 3,641 births registered in the Borough 73 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough. 652 births occurring in various lying-in and other institutions outside the Borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar-General. When the 73 "outward" transfers are deducted 7 and the 652 "inward" transfers are added to the 3641, births actually registered in the Borough, the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 4,220. This gives a corrected birth.rate of 22.5 Birth.rate for the last Thirty Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington. St. George's St. Saviour's and Christchurch.

These deaths in institutions comprised 443 belonging to Southwark and 514 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,141. When the 526 deaths of those persons who were non-parishioners, but who died in our Borough, have been deducted, and the 1,111 "outlying'' deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the sanitary area is found to be 2,661 of which number 1,501 were males and 1,160 females. The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 14.2 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1924, as against a rate of 12-8 for 1923. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 42.8. The principal localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are as follows Southwark Hospital 623 Mental Hospitals 123 Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals 85 St. Thomas's Hospital 52 Lambeth Hospital 25 Belgrave Hospital 13 King's College Hospital 22 Royal Waterloo Hospital 15 In the Street and other Institutions 183 Total 1141 10 TABLE 3.

Other districts are served by the Eanyard Nurses who do valuable work, while some parishes provide a nurse for their own district. A Home Help is supplied by the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme to assist sick mothers in their house work or during their temporary absence, but nurses are no longer employed by the Council for the nursing of cases of measles. DIPHTHERIA ANTITOXIN. Diphtheria Antitoxin can be obtained any time at the Council's Reception House, King James Street, Lancaster Street, including Sunday and all Public Holidays, and also on ordinary week days, during the hours between 9.0 a.m. and 5.30 p.m., at the Town Hall. This is always kept in a fresh condition, and a sterilised syringe is also lent if necessary to give the injection. LABORATORY WORK.

VERMINOUS PERSONS CLEANSED DURING 1924. During the year 4,094 persons were cleansed at the station in King James Street. Under our agreement with the London County Council, 3,252 children were cleansed. One cleansing was found to be sufficient in verminous cases, except when the cases were associated with impetigo, when two or three cleansings had to be given. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 842 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 759 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1923. 50 MORTUARIES. table 29.

Southwark Tuberculosis Dispensary, 82-84, Newington Causeway, S.E To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting herewith my Annual Report for the year 1924. I took over charge of the Tuberculosis work in Southwark in April last, and have endeavoured to carry on the work on similar lines to my predecessor, Dr. Wilson. Thanks to the very able, energetic and loyal staff I think we have succeeded in our endeavours, as the appended tables will show. The overcrowding of industrial tenements and dwellings is still a very difficult problem. A large number of cases have been sent away to Sanatoriums under the London County Council Scheme, and it is a great thing that they are able to send the London patients to such a varied number of sanatoriums, situate in all parts of the South and Midlands. The question of advanced cases is still rather difficult, and there are so comparatively few places which will take them, and advanced cases unfortunately are so averse to going away at all. The Invalid Children's Aid Society do invaluable work in the way of sending delicate children away to suitable Convalescent Homes. The Care Committee also do good work in keeping the families of patients at Sanatoria under supervision during their absence. The Nurses have paid a very large number of visits to the homes of the patients and do most excellent propaganda work in instructing both the patients themselves and their families how to keep their homes— in spite of all kinds of disadvantages—in a healthy and sanitary condition. We have had three shelters in constant use, and some of the patients say they would not sleep inside a house again. Nourishment has been given to a number of patients from the Dispensary, especially in cases waiting for admission to, and for a short time after discharge from Sanatorium. We have also lent out eight beds for the use of patients in their own homes. The X-Ray has been used with great advantage in the diagnosis of difficult cases at Guy's Hospital. Light treatment has been used with good results on cases of Tuberculosis of the Skin. We have had 840 specimens of sputum examined at the Analyst's Department of the Borough. A good watch is kept on the old cases, both by ourselves and the periodic reports the County Council require, but a large amount of work has been done for the ex-service consumptive patients by the Ministry of Pensions in conjunction with the Dispensary. I append tables of statistics of the work done during the year 1924. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. T. CROWE, Tuberculosis Officer. 105 TABLE A.
