STPAN 19 SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOB THE YEAR 1862. TO THE VESTRY OF SAINT PANCRAS. Gentlemen, During the year 1862, the deaths registered in St. Paneras, exclusive of 151 in the Strand Union Workhouse, numbered 4388;* the births during the same period were 6808 in number. As compared with ten previous years, the mortality is rather lower; the average mortality of ten years (raised 10 per cent., for the increase in population) was 4675, including the deaths in the Strand Union, and the mortality in 1862 (also including the deaths from the Strand) was 4539. If the population in the middle of 1862 be taken as 203,000, the rate of mortality was, without the Strand Union deaths, 21.6 per thousand, or with the Strand Union deaths, 22.4 per thousand. In the whole of London the rate of mortality was 23.49 per thousand; in the group of districts, of which St. Pancras is one, namely the Northern Districts, the rate of mortality was 21.96 per thousand. This group includes St. Marylebone, Ilampstead, Islington, and Hackney. The birth-rate in St. Paneras was 33.5 per thousand; in London it was 33.77 per thousand. * The number represents what were registered in 52 weeks ending December 27th, 1862; the number registered as actually occurring in 1862, from January 1st to December 31st, was 4 more than this, viz., 4392, excluding the Strand. Of these, 76 persons died in University College Hospital, and 80 in the Royal Free Hospital, who had been brought from other districts; and in outlying Hospitals, viz., Middlesex (45), King's College (12), Bartholomew's (12), the Children's (18), the Fever (38), and Charing Cross (1), 126 St. Paneras people died. If corrections be made for these numbers, the mortality would be reduced to 4362; but this probably would bo too great a reduction, because it is likely that in other London Hospitals not mentioned some St. Paneras people died. 2 The rate of mortality in the six sub-districts of the Parish varied from 19.7 in Kentish Town to 23.2 in Tottenham Court, whilst the other sub-distriets stood as follows, in order of salubrity: next to Kentish Town was Regent's Park, then Camden Town, next Gray's Inn Road, followed by Somers Town, and Tottenham Court lowest on the list. In the order of infant mortality, estimated by the proportion of deaths under 5 to the births, the sub-districts were arranged as follows, beginuing with the least unhealthy:—Kentish Town, Regent's Park, Gray's Inn Road, Camden Town, Somers Town, and Tottenham Court. Infant Mortality.—Compared with the gross population, the deaths under 5 years were as 92 to every ten thousand; and as children under 5 years of age form about one-eighth of the entire population, the rate of mortality amongst children at that age was about 73-6 per thousand, more than three times the mortality at all ages. Table I. gives a detailed account of the causes of death, and the ages at wliich these causes proved fatal. The following is an abstract of the numbers from the different classes of disease:— I. Zymotic Diseases. 1. Miasmatic 984 2. Enthetic 31 3. Dietic 41 4. Parasitic 14 II. Constitutional Diseases. 1. Diathetic 142 2. Tubercular and Ricketty 792 III. Local Diseases. 1. Diseases of the Nervous System 468 2. Diseases of the Vascular System 183 3. Diseases of the Respiratory System 753 4. Diseases of the Digestive System 215 5. Diseases of the Uriliary Organs 67 6. Diseases of the Organs of Generation 13 7. Diseases of the Organs of Locomotion 7 8. Diseases of the Skin 14 IV. Developmental Diseases. 1. Malformations and Diseases of Infantile velopment 95 2. Diseases of Development in middle age 17 3. Diseases of Development in old age 193 4. Diseases of Nutrition 163 3 V. Violent Deaths. 1. Accidental or from Negligence 114 2. Homicidal 12 3. Suicidal 31 VI. Causes not specified 39 The Miasmatic Diseases, which include Small Pox, Measles, Scarlatina, Typhus and Typhoid Fevers, Hooping Cough, Diarrhoea, Diphtheria, and Erysipelas, gave 984 deaths; this is a few more than the average number in four preceding years, which was 974. Small Pox was fatal in 19 cases, 12 more than in 1861; Measles in 118, about the same number as in 1861; Scarlatina in 257, 56 more than in the preceding year; Diphtheria in 68 cases, more than in any previous year; Croup in 38; Hooping Cough gave 160 deaths, Low Fevers 156, Diarrhoea 94, and Cholera 6 deaths. Of the Small Pox deaths, only one is positively stated to have been after vaccination; and in 11 cases no mention of vaccination was made. In my Report last year I made the following remark: "From Small Pox the number of deaths was only 7, a lower mortality than has prevailed since my appointment ill 1856. It is to be hoped that the absence of deaths from this disease will not encourage a neglect of vaccination, because so certainly as this is the case will another epidemic of Small Pox break out within a few years, and cut off a large number of those who arc unprotected." Out of 6865 registered births in the year ending September, 1861, only 3082 were vaccinated by the Parochial Vaccinators, whilst of 6692 births in the year ending Michaelmas, 1862, only 2854 were vaccinated; in 1859-60 there had been 3689 public vaccinations. We see from these numbers that there had been an increasing neglect of vaccination from 1860 to 1862. My fears then expressed have since been realised. The deaths from Small Pox, which numbered only 7 in 1861, amounted to 8 in the first three quarters of 1862, to 11 in the fourth quarter of that year, to 11 in the first quarter of 1863, and to 31 in the 2nd quarter of 1863. The great majority of these Zymotic diseases might be prevented, by strictly following sanitary laws. Tubercle and Rickets gave rise to no fewer than 792 deaths, of which more than one-half depend on impure air and improper food. Diseases of the breathing apparatus were not so fatal as they have been in some previous years; they caused, however, 753 deaths. Child-birth was fatal to 24 women, 7 of whom were victims to what is called Puerperal Fever. Erysipelas was fatal in 21 cases, and there were a considerable number of cases of Pyoetnia following accidents and surgical operations. Delirium Tremens and Intemperance are recorded as the causes of 18 deaths. Syphilis was immediately fatal in 24 instances. The Violent Deaths numbered 157, of which 114 were from accident or negligence, 31 suicidal, and 12 homicidal. Five of the accidental deaths were due to accidents on the railways; 16 from accidents by vehicles drawn by horses; one scaffold accident; two from falls from a window; 14 deaths were from burns; 10 from scalds; 1 from an explosion of Paraffin oil; 1 from drinking boiling water; 14 children were suffocated under bed clothes, and 3 choked by food or other substances in the throat. There were 19 deaths by drowning, of which 10 were probably suicidal. There were 5 deaths from poison, of which 3 were suicidal. Nine persons committed suicide by hanging, 2 by shooting themselves, and 4 by cutting their throats. 4 WORKHOUSE. In this establishment the deaths numbered 464, nearly as many as in 1861, and above the average of 6 years. There were 14 deaths from Measles, 3 from Scarlatina, 2 from Hooping Cough, 3 from Diarrhoea, 5 from Erysipelas or Puerperal Fever, 75 from Consumption, and 65 from Affections of the Breathing Organs. There were 203 deaths over 60 years of age, and 77 under 5 years. MORTALITY IN MEWS. I have again tabulated the deaths in Mews, and placed the Table at the end of this Report (Table D). It will be seen that the deaths numbered 52, which, out of a population of nearly 3000, is rather a low mortality. Of these deaths, 2 were from Low Fever, 2 from Measles, 1 from Scarlet Fever, 1 from Small Pox, 1 from Hooping Cough, and 1 from Rheumatic Fever. Fifteen were from Bronchial or Pulmonary inflammation, 7 from Tubercular diseases, 9 from Nervous diseases of infancy, 5 from Atrophy or conguintal debility, and 6 from other chronic diseases. One child was accidentally poisoned by an over-dose of laudanum. METEOROLOGY. The mean temperature was 49°.5, which was l°.l above the mean in 91 preceding years, and nearly the same as in 1861. The temperature of the first quarter averaged 41°.1, which was 2°.6 'above the average; the second quarter averaged 530.3, which was 1°.2 above the mean; the average in the third quarter was 580.7, which was 0o.7 below the mean of other years; and the fourth quarter was 45°.0, which was l0.4 above the average of corresponding quarters. The mean daily range of temperature was l4°.6, which is 10.2 less than usual. The degree of moisture was 84, which was 2 above the average. The average reading of the barometer was 29.766, which was 0.010 inch lower than usual. Rain fell to a depth of 26.4 inches, which was 2.1 inches more than the average, and nearly 6 inches more than in 1861, but considerably less than in 1860. The thermometer fell as low as 30° on the grass in 64 nights, and between 30° and 40° in 106 nights. The chief meteorological features of the year were a mild winter, a cool summer, and a slight excess of rain. The mean weekly amount of horizontal movement of the air was 1680 miles; in 1861, it was 1666; in 1860, 1676; and in 1859, only 1598. SANITARY WORKS. During the year which ended on the 31st March, 1863, the following improvements were carried out under my superintendence:— New drains were constructed in 172 houses. New traps supplied to 705 drains. 5 The drairihge was improved in 145 houses. Cesspools emptied, filled up, and trapped water-closets provided in 138 houses. Cesspools emptied in 134 houses. New pans, traps, and water supplied to 146 closets. New water-closets erected for 11 houses. Water laid on to'closets in 132 houses. New dust-bins erected in 45 houses. Old dust-bins repaired in 18 houses. The paving of yards and cellars improved in 114 cases. Water laid on to 18 houses. Houses cleansed and limewhit«d to the number of 145. Overcrowding abated in 17 houses. Pigs removed from 23 sties. Cow-sheds improved to the number of 102. Heaps of manure removed from mews, wharves, &c., in 160 cases. Other nuisances not named above, to the number of 20, were removed. The Inspectors report, that in carrying out these improvements, 4715 inspections were made; slaughter-houses visited 831 times; the cow-houses, 986 times; and the markets visited 499 times. Written notices of advice were served to the number of 534, the final notices numbered 49, and in 26 cases summonses were necessary, in consequence of the notices having been neglected. The Police Courts were visited 67 times. There have been seized, as unfit for food, 111/2 pads of plaice, 5 pads of soles, 34 pads of mackerel, 2 barrels of sprats, 155 hake and whiting, and 2 barrels of herrings; also a large quantity of rotten apples, oranges, and plums, and 85 rabbits. In the autumn of last year, a new law came into operation, by which no dairyman can keep cows in London in any place which has not been previously licensed for that purpose. The license is to be granted annually by the Justices of the Peace, at a Special Sessions held in October; and it is necessary that every cowkeeper, who wishes to obtain a license for keeping cows, should give a fortnight's notice to the Vestry, of his intention to apply to the Sessions, in order that the Sanitary Officers may inspect the places, and report on their condition to the Vestry. It then becomes the duty of the Vestry to shew cause against the granting of the license in any case in which the place appears to be unfitted for the purpose. In consequence of the short time which had elapsed between the passing of the Act and its coming into operation, the magistrates were disposed to be more lenient in their requirements than they intend to be on future occasions. The nuisance arising from cowsheds in a crowded district is much greater than would be supposed by those who have only been in the habit of seeing cows in the fields, or at farmyards in the country. The food on which they are fed (namely, brewers' grains and vegetable matters, such as mangle wurzel, refuse from Covent Garden Market, and, in some cases, distillers' wash), in warm weather, gives rise to very disagreeable smells; and the close manner in which the cows are 6 huddled together, the imperfect way in which the sheds are paved, and the very general neglect of cleanliness amongst the cowkeepers, very much intensifies the stench arising from large accumulations of manure. There is of course a large quantity of refuse which finds its way into the neighbouring sewers from each cowshed, and when mixed with the other matters of the sewers, is decomposed and gives rise to effluvia of a most offensive and noxious kind, which find their way into the public roads by means of sewer ventilators, and to a large extent, though for the most part imperceptibly, into the dwelling-houses by means of house drains, notwithstanding the ordinarily constructed traps. Very considerable improvements have been effected in the arrangements of these sheds as regards paving, ventilation water supply, the storage and removal of dung, drainage, and their general management. A few of the worst were shut up, by the license being refused ; but licenses were granted to 88 cowkeepers for 102 distinct cowsheds. In regard to a number of these, the magistrates stated, that unless great improve, ments were effected during the present year, the license could not be renewed Of the 102 sheds, the amount of space allowed for each cow is not sufficient for the health of the animal in more than about 15. After deliberation and consultation with each other, the Medical Officers of Health of the Metropolis were of opinion that a cubic space of 1000 feet should be allowed for each cow. In 9 of the sheds in this parish the space was between 2 and 3 hundred feet only; in 18 it was between 3 and 4 hundred feet for each row; in 10 it was from 4 to 5 hundred feet; in 35 sheds the space for each was between 5 and 8 hundred cubic feet; in 10 it was from 8 to 10 hundred; and in only 10 was it over 1000 cubic feet. This is a point which requires more attention, and at the coming licensing day, will, I trust, be insisted upon. The total number of cows kept in the parish is about 1970. I cannot report much progress in regard to new sewerage during the year 1862. The drainage of Highgate and the upper part of Kentish Town has been under the consideration of the Highways, Sewers, and Public Works Committee, but no action has been taken. There appears to be still a doubt in the minds of some, in what way the expenses of sewers such as these should be met, and the matter remains in abeyance until a decision has been obtained in a case pending between the Kilburn District and the Metropolitan Board of Works. There are at present a very great many parts of this parish most imperfectly drained, and consequently very unhealthy, which cannot be improved until the Vestry provides new sewers for them. In this respect we are not much better off than when the Metropolis Local Management Act came into operation. A step has been taken in the right direction during the present year, by the order for a new sewer in John Street, Tottenham Court Road. In Agar Town and the neighbourhood of King's Cross, a good many wretched houses have been pulled down by the Midland and the Metropolitan Railway Companies. The Midland Company still holds a considerable number in Agar Town, which it is proposed to demolish, but in the mean time they are occupied and allowed to fall into a very dilapidated and unwholesome state. I am glad to hear that the Society for Improving the Dwellings of the Laboring Classes are proposing to purchase a plot of ground to the north of the Old Pancras Road, with the view of erecting some suitable houses for 7 artisans and others. They are at present in treaty with the Vestry on the matter, and I would venture to express a hope that you, Gentlemen, will offer them every reasonable facilities towards carrying out their object, inasmuch as it must clearly be for the welfare and. pecuniary interest of the parish, to have a respectable class of tenements, such as this Society would erect, in a locality which has in former times harboured thieves and persons of the very lowest grades of society. It would be well too, if the trustees of the Peabody Fund, which is to be mainly devoted to the erection of improved dwellings for the poor in London, could be induced to take land for this purpose in some part of St. Pancras. A place very well adapted for the purpose is that now occupied by Compton and Poplar Places, near Hunter Street, Brunswick Square; the land belongs to the Foundling Hospital, and the houses on it are in a very defective sanitary condition. The site occupied by Wellington Square is another eligible one. I do not know whether it is now too late to make a representation to those trustees on this subject; I would respectfully urge upon you the desirability of doing so. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, THOMAS I1ILLIER. [ Table I. J Shewing the causes of Death at different Ages during the year 1862. causes of death MALES AND FEMALES. At all Ages.

The numbers are probably rather above the actual population, but for comparing the rates of mortality, they may be adopted as the population in the middle of 1862, without leading to any serious error, and they are as near the truth as it is practicable to be. For the entire parish, 203,000 will be adoptod as the probable population, † This number is the sum of the estimated populations of the six sub-districts. If calculated on the assumption (which would probably be nearer the truth) that the population of the whole parish was increasing in the,ratio in which the gross population increased between 1851 and 1861, the number obtained would be only 202,263.
