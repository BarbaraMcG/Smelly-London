Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Twenty-Second Annual Report ???r the year ending the 25th March last. The Wood Paving in carriageways—St. George's Road, South???ark Bridge Road, and Long Lane—is in a very worn and unsatisfactory ???ndition ; also the granite paving at the carriageways of London Road ???nd Old Kent Road, and part of Borough High Street (from I rinity 34 Parish of Saint George the .^fartyr, Sou thwart. Street to Borough Road) on sanitary grounds I would recommend ??? these carriageways should be paved with Australian hard-wood bio??? —Karri or Jarrah. The old granite cubes from the London Road and Old K??? Road, and Borough High Street could, with advantage, be relaid??? adjacent side streets, where the traffic is not so great. This would??? a decided improvement in a sanitary point of view and a great sav??? in maintenance and scavenging. The whole of these works could be carried out by the Vesti??? workmen. During the year the Vestry have purchased 2,000 square ya??? of Victoria Stone, the whole of which has been laid by the Vestry's o??? Workmen in the best manner, at a cost considerably less than if 1??? by Contractors. It has been suggested by Members of the Vestry that Sanctuar??? should be constructed in the Old Kent Road at its junction with New Kent Road and Bermondsey New Road, also at the Newing??? Causeway end of the London Road, opposite the "Alfred's Head" a??? 35 Surveyor's Annual Report. the Borough High Street, between Great Dover Street and the ???arshalsea Road. I have given these matters my serious considera???n. The crossings are very dangerous to foot-passengers and the ???actuaries could, with great advantage, be constructed at the positions ???ntioned by altering the paving and tram-rails as required. It has also been suggested by Members of the Vestry that the ???nstruction of a Clock Tower, with underground Urinals, Lavatories, ???d Water Closets at the site of the Obelisk, St. George's Circus, would ??? a great public advantage and prove a profitable investment. I would respectfully recommend the Vestry to take these pro???sed improvements into consideration during the ensuing year, as ???ey are in each case urgently needed. 36 Parish of Saint Geonge the Martyr, Southwark.

SEWERS DEPARTMENT Complaints of the inconvenience and danger from the floo??? of basements of premises after storms continue to be made, arisin??? a great measure from the insufficient capacity of the Main Sewers in???

A number of Pipe Sewers, blocked in consequence of there??? having been a sufficient supply of water for flushing the same I??? been opened and cleansed. This arises in a great measure from t??? being no overflow from water-butts, cisterns, &c., as was the case u??? the intermittent supply system, the Water Company having laid constant supply no overflow occurs. This could be remedied by??? construction of flushing chambers and hydrants with meters fixe??? the Water Companies mains. By properly flushing the Pipe Sev??? the expense of opening down to clear the same would bi avoided, also the inconvenience and danger of stopping the drains. It would be very desirable to construct Underground Ur??? and Water closets in place of the Urinal in the St. George's Road, 43 Surveyor's Annual Report. ???stminster Bridge Road, opposite Tower Street.
