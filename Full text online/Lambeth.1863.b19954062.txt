Flushing and Cleansing has been carried out as before, and the Sewers, both covered and open, are in a fair state of cleanliness. Complaints of stoppage, flooding, and other defects have been promptly examined, and remedied at far as possible, where the duty of doing so has been with the Vestry. The House Drainage has been somewhat more than last year, from the circumstance of several new sewers having been constructed. The applications for house drainage are for 568 houses, upon which about £900 has been paid into the office. The estimated cost of private work done by the applicants is £5,000, which has been executed under the inspection and general supervision of the officers of the Vestry. New Buildings.—The Vestry have received notices for building 486 new houses, the drainage of which, and the level of the lowest floors in relation to the sewers have been considered and approved as directed by the Act. 6 Thirty-three applications, made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, for leave to bring out and alter frontages, have been referred to the Vestry, and reported upon by them. The approval of the Metropolitan Board has been given for the formation of eighteen new streets. Great improvements have been effected by the works carried out by the Metropolitan Board, in constructing Sewers at Water Lane and South Lambeth, by which the open Effra Sewer, so long a source of nuisance and complaint, has been filled in and abolished, and thus evils of the greatest magnitude have been permanently removed. At Water Lane the whole of the site of the Sewer has been thrown into the public way, and the road widened to an average extent of 12 feet. At South Lambeth the site has been secured, so far as is required to widen and improve the line of roadway from Vauxnall Cross to the South Lambeth Toll-gate, The construction of the Main High Level Sewer has afforded the means of drainage for large areas, hitherto unprovided for. 7 SANITARY MATTERS. In the year 1863 there were 6,593 births registered, being 566 more than in 1862, the highest number previously recorded. In the first quarter of the year 1681; in the second quarter 1658; in the third quarter 1556; and in the fourth quarter 1698. The deaths recorded during the year were 3,828; viz. —in the first quarter 1,042; in the second quarter 839; in the third quarter 911; and in the fourth quarter 1036. Table II. shows the births and deaths during each quarter of the year, in each of the eight Ecclesiastical Divisions of the Parish. In the Waterloo Road, 1st part district, there were 578 births during the year, and 366 deaths; in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part, 949 births, and 437 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 1st part, 834 births, and 458 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 2nd part, 1,343 births, and 967 deaths—291 of which were in the Workhouse; in the Kennington, 1st part district, 1,238 births, and 629 deaths: in the Kennington, 2nd part, 653 births, and 413 deaths; in the Brixton District, 665 births, and 415 deaths; and in the Norwood, 333 births, and 143 deaths—13 of which were in the Children's Workhouse. The different periods of life in which the deaths took place are set forth in Table III. Thus 1,771 deaths occurred under 5 years of age; 272 between 5 and 20 years, 483 between 20 and 40 years; 548 between 40 and 60 years; 8 606 between 60 and 80 years; and 148 at 80 years and upwards. The general healthiness of the parish as indicated by its entire mortality, continues to bear most favorable comparison with the rest of the Metropolis. The death-rate for the year, although greater than in some previous years, being lower than that of any group of the Metropolitan Districts. It appears, from the Annual Return of the Registrar-General, that (with the exception of the Western Districts) the Southern Districts of the Metropolis have become the most healthy. The comparative mortality of Lambeth, the Metropolis, and the Southern Districts is shown in Table IV. The death-rate appears somewhat greater than the actual mortality of the year, from the necessity of once in about five or six years including 53 weeks, instead of 52 in the Returns. From this Table it is seen that the mortality of Lambeth was two per cent below the whole of London, and one per cent below the Southern Districts, of which the population of Lambeth forms rather more than a fifth part. The four most healthy districts of the parish, were Norwood, Brixton, Kennington, 1st, and Kennington 2nd parts. The four least healthy—the Waterloo Road, 1st and 2nd parts, and the Lambeth Church, 2nd and 1st part districts. The average number of inmates of the Adult Workhouse was 882, and the deaths 291; excluding the Workhouse, the death-rate of the Lambeth Church, 2nd part district, would be 231 2, instead of 321 0 per 10,000. The average number of inmates of the Norwood Workhouse was 355, and the deaths 13; the death-rate, therefore, of the Norwood District, excluding the Workhouse, would become 161.0, instead of 169.0 per 10,000 of the population. 9 Epidemic diseases (Table V.) caused 899 deaths, being in the proportion of nearly 23½ per cent of the entire mortality; the; deaths from epidemic diseases were forty below those in the previous year, Scarlatina and Measles being less frequent; the former caused 207 deaths, against 368 in 1862; and the latter 97 deaths, against 116 in 1862. But a great increase occurred from Small Pox, the deaths from which were 63, against 6 in 1862, and 11 in 1861; Typhus caused 164 deaths, against 154 in 1862; Diarrhoea 171, against 116 in 1862; Whooping Cough 163, against 151 in 1862; and Diptheria 34, against 28 in 1862. The year was remarkable for the severe outbreak of Small Pox in the Metropolis, from which this parish also suffered, but in a minor degree, no doubt owing to the very successful measures adopted to arrest its progress. In the six months preceding December, 1862, only five cases had been treated by the Poor Law Medical Oflicers of this Parish. During January there were eight cases reported by the Medical Officers, in February six, March thirty-eight, April forty, May eighty-four, June forty-seven, July thirty-seven, August twenty, September twelve, October twenty-four, November twenty-seven, and December twenty. The means adopted at first to prevent the disease spreading, were the removal of the sick to the Small Pox Hospital; at the end of March, however, the hospital being insufficient to accommodate the very numerous applications for admission from all quarters, it became necessary to provide other means, consequently, two Wards at the Work' house were set apart, one for the reception of male, and the other for female patients; a house-to-house visitation, in some of the localities in which Small Pox prevailed, was instituted for the purpose of finding out the unvaccinated; and the 10 Medical Officer of Health visited all cases reported to him where persons refused to be vaccinated; and by persuasion, or pointing out the penalties of the law, succeeded in inducing them to have vaccination performed by the District Vaccinators. The total number of vaccinations is shown in Table VI., from which it will be seen there were 6,592 successful vaccinations, or re-vaccinations performed by the ten District Medical Officers during the year, of which 800 were done in the first quarter, 3,750 in the second quarter, 1,365 in the third quarter, and 677 in the fourth quarter of the year. The vaccinations corresponded almost exactly with the number of births, and must be considered satisfactory, when it is remembered that this statement only comprises those per. formed by the District Vaccinators, and is irrespective of the large number performed by the rest of the medical profession, and seven of those vaccinated at Public Institutions. Table VII. gives the number of cases of Small Pox under the care of the District Medical Officers during each quarter of the year, also the total number of removals into the Small Pox Hospital during the year, and into the Small Pox Wards of the Workhouse during the seven months they were opened to receive patients. By the kindness of Mr. Marson, Surgeon to the Small Pox Hospital, the Medical Officer of Health has ascertained that 1,537 cases of Small Pox were admitted during the year into that Institution, of which 290 died; the persons admitted from Lambeth were 58, of whom 13 died. Including then the 13 deaths in the Small Pox Hospital, from Lambeth, with the 63 occurring in the parish (nearly half of which were unvaccinated), the deathrate from Small Pox would have been about 50 per cent 11 greater, if the same rate had prevailed in Lambeth as in the rest of the Metropolis. One other disease, viz., Typhus, requires special notice, from having prevailed to a considerably greater extent in the densely populated districts, since the removal of small houses, caused by the formation of the numerous railways of South London. I he great dilliculty of obtaining lodgement for the working classes, has caused overcrowding of the poor in an unprecedented manner, and consequently the development of Typhus, which is considered to be bred in the pestilential atmosphere of overcrowded dwellings. It is much to be feared that this disease will exist more or less in densely populated Districts, until some plan is adopted whereby the overcrowding may be diminished. During the year, 200 cases of Typhus have been removed to the Fever Hospital, and the houses in which fever occurred were visited by the Medical Oflicer and Inspectors, under whose superintendance clcansing and lime-whiting have been carried out. Between the 25th March, 1863, and the 25th March, 1864, 2,091 Coses of Nuisance were brought under the notice of the General Purposes Committee by the Medical Officer and Inspectors of Nuisances. In addition to these, a great number of houses were visited in consequence of the existence of Epidemic Disease. Of the houses visited, 575 were found to require cleansing or lime-whiting; 731 houses were rendered unwholesome by reason of cesspools or want of proper drainage, for 371 of which good drainage was provided; for 91 others the drainage was cleansed and improved, and in the remaining 230 cases the cesspools were emptied and cleansed, no other means of drainage being available, 38 gully obstructions were removed; and 19 foul urinals 12 cleansed and improved: 55 cases of offensive smells, many of which arising from trade nuisances, were abated; 230 cases of accumulations of dung, and other offensive matters were removed; 845 dust-bins emptied; 40 new ash-pits provided; and 53 lots of pigs, 288 in number, were removed. To effect the above, 422 Notices were served; and in 17 instances, Summonses were heard, and convictions obtained. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. In the Autumn, the Medical Officer visited the whole of the Slaughter-houses. The points insisted on were good paving, water supply, proper drainage, and cleanliness. The lime-whiting, &c., having been carried out under the supervision of the Inspectors of Nuisances. Licenses were granted for 123. COW-HOUSES. The Medical Officer also visited the whole of the Cowhouses. The condition of many of them was not satisfactory. However, as this was only the second year of the system of licensing the licenses were not opposed, on the understanding that another year further improvements would be required. All the Cow-houses were properly lime-whited under the superintendance of the Inspectors. Licenses were granted for 112. 13 BAKE-HOUSES. "The Bake-house Regulation Act" (26th and 27th Vict., cap. 40) was passed on the 13th July, 1863. All the Bakeries, 203 in number, were visited by the Medical Officer, —111 whereof required improvement. The Bakers and Confectioners readily performed what was required of them, and the whole of the Bake-houses were put into a satisfactory state under the supervision of the Inspectors of Nuisances.

Clapham Road, from Paradise Road and Chapel Street, to the Parish boundary, has been paved on both sides. Repairs and Improvements, of various extent, have been made in Cornwall Road, Windmill Street, Gipscy Hill, Loughborough Road, College Street, Belvedere Road, York Road, Cross Street, Ann Street, Agnes Street, Frances Street, Duke Street, Vine Street, Waterloo Road, John Street, Broad Street, Catherine Street, Palace New Road, Stock well Green, William Street, China Walk, Devonshire Place, Love Lane, &c. The amount paid into the office as Contributions to the cost of various works during the year, was £1,209 15s. 5d. ; and by Gas and Water Companies, for repairs to roads, £134 13s. 6d. 23 LIGHTING. The total number of Public Lamps lighted by the Vestry, at the present time, are 2,292. The cost of lighting, including the removals of lamps, new columns, and sundries, for the year ending the 25th March, 1864, amounted to £10,369 14s. 7d. This shows an increase of lamps to the number of 29, although the cost is reduced by £32 6s. 1d.; which is owing to a reduction in the price of gas supplied by the South Metropolitan Gas Company. In the past year, 62 memorials and applications were received, for improved lighting in various parts of the Parish; 56 of these were acceded to, by the erection of new lamps or removals, and 6 were refused. There have been 32 new lamps erected, 3 lamps have been discontinued, and 24 others have been removed, to more desirable positions. The Photometer—which has been fitted-up in the Vestry Offices, during the past year—has proved of great service to the Chemical Examiner in his experiments on the illuminating power, the purity, and the pressure of gas supplied to the Parish; these experiments have been carried on with great regularity, and a monthly report has been made, which has shown very satisfactory results. 24 UTILIZATION OF METROPOLITAN SEWAGE. This highly important question has been considered by the Vestry, with the object of reducing, by the revenue derivable from the Metropolitan Sewage, our local burthens. That a Committee was appointed by Vestry, at whose invitation several Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis sent Delegates, to co-operate thereon. Resolutions were passed by the Delegates, calling upon the Corporation of the City of London to inquire into the subject. This was duly responded to, and Memorials were presented to the House of Commons. A Committee was appointed by the House; and as a result of their inquiries and evidence taken, a Report has been made of the utmost value to all Ratepayers and others, who contribute to the large amount of taxation levied within the Metropolitan area.
