Brentford Urban District Council. ANNUAL REPORT, 1911. To the Chairman and Members of the Brentford Urban District Council. March 23rd, 1912. Gentlemen, I beg to present my report upon the health and sanitary condition of the Brentford Urban Sanitary District for the year 1911. POPULATION. The census which was taken in April, 1911, gives the population of Old Brentford—males 7211, females 7274, total 14485; and of New Brentford—males 969, females 1130, total 2099. These totals added together give the population of the Urban District as 16584. At the last census in 1901 the population was—Old Brentford 13136, New Brentford 2027, total 15163, so that there is an increase of 1421 in the 10 years. Without the census returns my estimate of the population would have been 16626 to the end of June. The correct estimate is—Old Brentford 14507, New Brentford 2101, total 16608. BIRTHS. The number of births has been 434, of which 222 were males, and 212 females. The birth rate is 26.1 per thousand, which is 2.9 lower than last year, and 5-y lower than the average of the last 10 years, and the lowest yet recorded. In fact the birth rate is steadily decreasing. 14 of these births were illegitimate. DEATHS. The number of deaths occurring in Brentford during the year has been 211, of which 103 were males and 108 females. In Old Brentford 182, and New Brentford 29, the death rates of which were respectively, Old Brentford 12.5 per thousand, New Brentford 13.8 per thousand. The Cottage Hospital is in New Brentford, where 5 deaths occurred ; and the Isolation Hospital is in Old Brentford, where 1 death took place. The death rate for the whole district is 12.7 per thousand. Included in this return are 4 deaths of nonresidents, viz., 1 in Cottage Hospital, 2 in the Thames, and 1 on a barge on the Canal, so that the correct death rate for residents who 6 died in Brentford is 12.4 per thousand, which is 3- higher than last year, but -8 lower than the average of the last 10 years. CORRECTED DEATH RATE. I have been supplied with the particulars of 83 deaths of inhabitants of Brentford who have died outside the town during the year. 66 of these lived in Old Brentford, and 17 in New Brentford. These when added to the 207 who died in the town gives a total of 290 which I believe is a true account of the number of deaths which Brentford suffered during the year, and gives a total death rate of 17.4 per thousand. The following table gives the corrected death rate since 1905, when I was first supplied with a list of the residents of Brentford who had died outside the town. 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 17.6 17 19.2 14.9 14.9 13.3 17.4 They died in the following Institutions: — Brentford Workhouse Infirmary 54 Middlesex County Asylum 5 West London Hospital 8 Western Hospital 3 Richmond Hospital 3 Various London Hospitals and places 10 13 of these deaths were due to senile decay, 12 to diseases of the respiratory organs, 10 to tuberculous diseases, 7 to cancer, 7 to heart disease, 7 to diseases of brain, 5 to diseases of liver, and 4 to diarrhoea. INQUESTS. 20 inquests have been held. Last year the number was 21, and the year before 25. Death resulted from heart disease in 6 instances, drowning in 3, pneumonia in 2, and 1 each from injuries on the railway, crushed by a cart, scalds, aneurysm, hcemorrhage, apoplexy, marasmus, diarrhoea, and gangrene. The following table epitomises the ages at which death occurred. Under 1 year 69 101 under 5 years old. 1 and under 5 years 32 5 „ 15 „ 7 110 over 5 years. 15 „ 25 „ 8 25 „ 65 „ 64 Over 65 „ 31 9 of these deaths occurred in persons over 80 years old. 7 INFANT MORTALITY. The rate of this mortality or the proportion of deaths under I year to every 1000 births is 158.9, which is 52.5 higher than last year, and 23.4 higher than the average of the last 10 years and the highest since 1904. In analysing the causes of these deaths I find that 25 deaths were caused by diarrhoea, 16 of which occurred in August, 5 were due to measles, 9 were premature births, 6 were caused by congenital defects and 5 to weakness from birth. I feel convinced that many of these lives might have been saved if greater care in the feeding had been observed and I would submit that a Woman Health Visitor, whose duty it would be to visit poor mothers from child birth, and instruct them in the care and feeding of their infants would do much to reduce this heavy mortality. The following table gives the rate and average infant mortality for the last 10 years. 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 Average for 10 years 176.6 125 161.4 115 140.7 113.6 120.6 103.5 106.4 158.9 132 The following are the deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases. SMALL POX.—None. MEASLES.—A very severe outbreak of measles commenced in May, and did not abate until September, causing 26 deaths, viz.: in January, 1; May, 4; June, 4; July, 10; and August, 7. I am afraid parents fail to recognise the gravity of this disease of childhood and take no precaution either of isolating the sufferers or even preventing them from mixing freely with the rest of the family or keeping them from school. SCARLET FEYER.—Has caused no deaths although many cases have been notified. WHOOPING COUGH.—There were many cases in the earlier part of the year and 3 deaths were registered. DIPHTHERIA AND MEMBRANOUS CROUP.—One death only was recorded. Many cases were notified but with the free and early use of antitoxin, which is supplied free to Medical Practitioners, for the use of the inhabitants of the Town, the mortality from this disease, which used to be considered one of the most deadly has practically disappeared. TYPHUS FEYER.—None. There has been no case recorded for several years, and with the improved sanitary conditions I do not expect ever to see another case. 8 ENTERIC FEVER.—There has been a curious outbreak of one part of the district. The cases were very mild. They were so slight that the patients were scarcely in some instances confined to bed, and there were no deaths. DIARRH(EA AND ENTERITIS.—This disease has caused 26 deaths, chiefly in infants under 1 year old. 16 of these deaths were in August when the weather was intensely hot, and I think it may be attributed to the exceptional heat and absence of rain, for the mortality was very general all over the Metropolitan area. I have suggested elsewhere in my report one of the remedies I should like to see tried. The number of deaths from these 8 zymotic diseases has been 56, and the zymotic death rate is 3.3 per thousand, which is 2.2 higher than last year and 1 higher than the average of the last 10 years. As I anticipated in my report last year the low mortality from these diseases in 1909 and 1910 was probably due to the cool summer, and I was afraid that, given a hot summer and plenty of fruit, the death rate would be as high as ever. I am Sorry my prophecy was right and I must now try other means, if permitted, to check this disastrous and generally preventible loss of life. 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 Average for 10 years Number of births 532 536 545 530 476 519 464 468 479 434 498.3 Birth rate per 1000 34.7 34.8 34.8 33.6 29.9 32.3 28.6 28.6 29 26.1 31.2 Deaths from all causes 237 200 252 208 216 234 174 175 157 207 206 Death rate per 1000 154 12.9 16.1 13.1 13 5 13.9 10.7 10.7 9.4 12.4 12.8 Deaths from Small Pox 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 „ Measles 5 0 26 0 4 12 0 10 0 26 8.3 ,, Scarlet Fever 0 0 0 4 7 5 0 1 0 0 1.7 „ Whooping Cough 0 7 3 2 3 8 1 7 1 3 3.5 ,, Diphtheria 8 3 3 11 12 6 2 0 1 1 4.7 „ Typhus Fever 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ,, Enteric Fever 0 1 4 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 .9 ,, Diarrhœa 22 13 34 16 32 1 17 10 17 26 18.8 ,, 8 Zymotic diseases 35 24 70 34 59 33 21 28 19 56 37.9 Death rate of Zymotic diseases 2.2 1.5 4.4 2.1 3.7 2.0 1.2 1.7 1.1 3.3 2.3 9 PHTHISIS.—With the still partial and incomplete registration of phthisis it is impossible for me to form any decided opinion as to the good results which have been obtained by the means which have been used here to check the spread of this infectious disease. I hope, now that an Act for the compulsory notification of all cases which comes into force on Jan. 1st, 1912, to be able next year to give some useful and reliable returns of the number of cases and the means which I have taken to prevent infection. I am a strong advocate for the sanatorium treatment both for early cases which I think can be cured in a majority of cases, and also for cases in the later stages where much can be done by teaching to prolong their own lives and prevent those who live with them, and attend to them, from contracting the disease. I will again repeat, although I may lay myself open to the charge of wearying my readers, the simple means which should be taken in all cases where there is a consumptive person in the house. 1.—Always live and sleep in a room with the windows open. 2.—Sleep alone. 3.—Expectorate into a pot containing a disinfectant, or into a rag which must be immediately burnt. (The Council supply disinfectants and spittoons free to the poor.) 4.—Do not spit on the floor, in the street, or in any public vehicle. I express a hope that a properly up-to-date Sanatorium be erected in Middlesex, and that no attempt will be made to utilise either a Small Pox Hospital, which may be required at any time for small pox patients, and possibly will be in the near future as an epidemic is now due, or Isolation Hospitals which were erected for the special purpose of isolating scarlet fever, diphtheria and enteric fever and are in all but a very few cases, none too large for that purpose. HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, &c., ACT, 1909. INSANITARY PROPERTY. During the past year 28 houses have been reported upon, of which 22 were closed upon representation being made to the various owners, 4 are in hand, and in two instances the Council made closing orders prohibiting their use as dwellings. I am pleased to report that no appeals have been lodged with the Local Government Board against any closing or demolition orders made by the Council, which speaks for the satisfactory manner in which the work of the Public Health Department is being carried on. The practice adopted is to call the attention of the owner to the property, and to ask for an interview, which request is readily granted, and in this way the condition of the property is brought home to the owners. 10 The following is a brief record of the insanitary property dealt with during the year :— Nos. 274 and 278, High Street. The Inspector submitted a detailed report on the sanitary condition of these bouses and was instructed by the Council to communicate with the owners, who, after viewing the property, decided not to attempt to repair. The property was then sold, and a cinematograph theatre has been erected on the site. No. 276, High Street. The Inspector submitted a detailed report on the sanitary condition of this house and was instructed by the Council to interview the owner who decided to close the house. The property was then sold and a specification of works (including the laying of new drains and the erection of a new w.c. and wash house) was presented to and approved by the Council. The works have been commenced but the house is still unoccupied. No. 11 Catherine Wheel Yard. The Inspector submitted a representation that this house was unfit for human habitation, whereupon a closing order was made by the Council, the owner agreeing to this course. The house has been demolished and a cottage erected on the site. Nos. 66 and 67 High Street. The Inspector reported to me that these houses were in a bad condition. I visited the property, and instructed the Inspector to communicate with the owners, who decided to close the houses. The houses have been demolished. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, Pump Alley. As a result of an inspection with your Inspector, these houses were found to be unfit for human habitation. The Inspector communicated with the owners who decided to close the houses, all of which are unoccupied. Thorn Cottage, High Road. I made an inspection of this house in company with the Inspector, as a result of which a record of the inspection was submitted to the Council, who issued an order prohibiting the use of the house for human habitation. The occupier was served with the usual notices to quit, and although every inducement was made to him by the owner to give up possession, he refused to leave the house. Finally application was made to the Justices for a warrant for his ejectment, which was duly executed, and the house demolished forthwith. No. 3 Market Place. This house and the outbuildings belonging thereto, were in a dilapidated and insanitary condition, and in accordance with the Council's instructions the owner was communicated with. The drains have been reconstructed, new w.c., and wash-house provided, the surface of the yard paved and dampcourse inserted to house walls, etc. 11 Nos. 18 and 20 Market Place. As a result of an inspection of these houses, the Inspector communicated with the Agents, and later met the owner on the property, who, after viewing the same decided to demolish the property forthwith. Nos. 15, 16, and 17, Ferry Square. The Inspector submitted to the Committee his record of the inspection of Nos. 15, 16, and 17, Ferry Square, and was instructed to communicate with the owner with a view to the houses being put into a habitable condition, but the owner decided not to attempt to repair them and agreed to close the Cottages. The houses are now unoccupied, and plans are being prepared for the erection of two cottages on the site. Nos. 31, 33, 35 and 37 Back Lane. I inspected these houses in company with the Inspector, and a record of the inspection was submitted to the Council, who postponed proceedings in order to give the owner an opportunity of putting the houses into a habitable condition. Two of the houses are unoccupied. Nos. 406 and 407 High Street. As a result of an inspection of these houses the Inspector communicated with, and later met the owner on the property, who, after viewing the same, decided to close the houses. It is the owner's intention to erect two houses on the site. TABLE A.

During the past year 65 houses have been demolished, 43 being demolished voluntarily by the owners at the request of the Inspector, and 22 in compliance with demolition orders made by the Council; also during the same period 12 cottages, 3 shops, and 1 theatre have been erected on the vacant sites. The demolition of three distinct blocks, comprising 23 houses in Running Horse Yard has removed one of the worse pieces of property in the district, and a great improvement has been effected. Only three houses now remain occupied in this yard, and these, I understand, will be dealt with soon. The owners of the adjoining property, known as Eaton's Buildings and Moore's Alley have been served with demolition orders which will shortly become operative. Three shops in the High Street, and three cottages at the rear known as Nos. I, 2 and 3 Ram Alley have been demolished and a like number of premises have been built. Cranes Cottages, Brook Road, which formed the subject of legal proceedings in 1909, were demolished in the early part of this year, and eight new cottages have betn erected on the site. The following is a complete list of property demolished during the year. 13 Situation of Property. No. of houses. Remarks.

Scarlet Fever 8 Total 82 *This patient was admitted supposed to be suffering from Enteric Fever but as the case developed I decided that it was not Enteric but Rheumatic Fever. He was too ill to be returned home and he eventually died in the Institution. I take this opportunity of expressing my satisfaction with the way the Matron and Nurses have carried out their duties during the year. Everything has worked well and smoothly, and that there has been only one death shows that the Nursing has been most efficient, and the attention unremitting. INFECTIOUS DISEASE (NOTIFICATION) ACT. Under this Act I have received 104 Certificates, being an increase of 43 as compared with last year. The following table shows the number of notifications received from Medical Practioners during the various months of the year. 15 Month. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Erysipelas. Membranous Croup.

During the year there has been an increase in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever, 55 cases being notified as compared with 24 in 1910. The largest number of cases notified was during the month of September and October, viz., 10. These 55 cases represent infection in 40 houses. The following table shows the school incidence.

Thirty two cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year being an increase of 10 as compared with 1910. The largest number of cases notified was during the month of October viz., 6. These 32 cases represent infection in 24 houses. The following table shows the School incidence.

It has not been found necessary to close any of the Schools on account of Epidemic Diseases. I never close my report without expressing my grateful thanks to the Masters and Mistresses of the public Elementary Schools for the help they have given me during the year. To their vigilance is due the fact that cases of infectious disease are frequently discovered and a probable epidemic consequently avoided. I should like to see the Medical Inspectors of the Schools chosen from the Medical Gentlemen of the Town, as I should be more in touch with them and they would be more likely to know the children's surroundings. The present system I do not consider satisfactory especially now the notification of tuberculous diseases will soon be compulsory. I wish to enter a protest against the constant multiplication of notices to the Local Government Board, County Medical Officer, Medical Inspectors of Schools and other persons. The time of the Sanitary Inspector is already so occupied that valuable work in the Town has to be neglected in order that he may furnish these reports which are in the main useless and unnecessary. My best thanks are also tendered to Sister Lucas and the Cottage Hospital Staff for the enormous progress which has been made in the nursing of the Sick Poor during the last few years, work which has always been fostered by the enlightened policy of the Committee. In conclusion I have the most sincere satisfaction in congratulating the Council that Mr. Coleman is still the Sanitary Inspector. His knowledge and his courtesy go hand in hand and whatever he undertakes he carries to a successful finish. The Inspector possesses the special certificate as Inspector of Meat and other Foods granted by the Royal Sanitary Institute. The Local Government Board desire it to be mentioned in the report if the Inspector holds this qualification. I am, gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. BOTT, Medical Officer of Health. 18 TABLE I.

FIFTH Annual REPORT of the Sanitary Inspector. 1911. 26 Public Health Department Brentford, March, 1912. To the Chairman and Members of the Brentford Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you, pursuant to the Order and Circular of the Local Government Board, my FIFTH Annual Report in which is recorded particulars of the work done in connection with the inspection of the district. The circular of the Local Government Board, which was issued with the Sanitary Officers (outside London) Order, 1910, states that : " By sub-clause 16 the Inspector is to make an annual report to the Council on the work performed by him during the year. INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. The total number of inspections made to premises in connection with the work of the department was 2019, including visits to dairies, cowsheds, milk shops, canal boats, common lodging houses, visits to works in progress, house to house inspections and to houses in which cases of infectious disease have occurred. There has been an increase in the number of inspections as compared with last year and a corresponding increase in the amount of work accomplished, particularly under the Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act. Wherever nuisances were found to exist, notices were served upon the persons responsible, calling attention to the matter, and pointing out the necessary remedial works. If these notices were not complied with reports were made to the Sanitary Committee and the usual statutory notices were ordered to be served. I am pleased to report that very little trouble was experienced in persuading owners and occupiers to remedy the sanitary defects reported. The supervision of the work carried out for the abatement of nuisances has been well maintained, and, while no attempt has been made to exercise unreasonable control, the efficient execution of the work was insisted upon. 27 FOOD INSPECTION. The premises wherein food is prepared or kept for sale have been frequently visited, and in twenty instances the food which came under my observation was found to be unfit for human consumption. In fifteen instances the articles were destroyed with the consent of the owner, upon attention being called to the condition of the food ; and in five cases application was made before a Justice of the Peace, and orders were obtained to destroy the food so as to prevent it being used in any way for human consumption. A quantity of veal and sausages in a state of decomposition was seized from a butcher's shop. The matter was reported to your Committee, and the person in whose possession the same was found was cautioned by order of the Council and no further action was taken. In another instance a quantity of beef exposed for sale was seized from a shop in the High Street, the same being utterly unfit for food. Proceedings in this case were ordered to be taken as the person had previously been cautioned. The Justices imposed a penalty of 20s. and £1 2s. costs. Shortly after, the business was taken over by a partner, but the shop was kept under close observation and on the 5th July, at 8 p.m., I observed a quantity of meat being taken from a cart into the shop. I immediately entered the shop, examined the meat, and found it to be in a very dropsical condition and unfit for human food. The butcher indignantly denied that the meat was unfit for food, but the Medical Officer of Health and Veterinary Inspector confirmed my opinion. The meat was seized and submitted to a Vstice of the Peace who gave an order for its destruction. Enquiries were made and it was ascertained that the meat which was seized formed the carcase of a heifer which had died and was flayed in a neighbouring district, and sold for a small sum to the butcher in question, to be used only for cat's meat. The matter was fully reported to the Council who authorised proceedings to be taken against the butcher for being in possession of unsound meat intended for human food. The defendant, through his solicitor, pleaded that he had been duped, but the Court ordered him to pay a penalty of £10 and £1 2s. costs. The following table shows the amount of food seized or surrendered during the year, all of which was destroyed by burning at the destructor. 28 No. Article of Food. Weight lbs. Result of Examination.

During the year the drains of twenty-three houses and premises have been reconstructed. The work of reconstructing drains has been carefully supervised, and frequent visits have been made to the premises while such work was in progress. All drains and vent pipes were subjected to the application of the water or air test before being covered up. The material used in the construction of new drains was chiefly of stoneware pipes, but in several instances heavy cast iron pipes were used. Fifty gullies, 10 intercepting traps, 22 pedestal water closets, 4 soil pipes, 12 fresh air inlets, and 11 ventilation shafts were fixed and 34 disconnecting and access chambers built. Some trouble was again experienced in connection with combined drainage, but I am pleased to report that satisfactory negotiations were entered into with the owners, and the expenses of legal proceedings avoided. The following is a list of the premises the drains of which have been reconstructed during the year. Situation of Premises. No. of Premises, Materials used in construction.

In my last report I mentioned that application had been made to the Local Government Board to confirm an order made by the Council to add the following trades to the list of offensive trades enumerated in the principal Act, viz., Fish Frier, Gut Scraper, and Rag and Bone Dealer. The order has now been confirmed by the Board, and any person who establishes in this District any of the foregoing trades without consent in writing from the Council will be liable to the penalties prescribed by the principal Act. The premises whereon offensive trades are carried on, have been inspected and kept, as far as the nature of the business will allow, in a clean manner. One application was received during the year tor consent lo establish the business of a Bone Boiler in conjunction with another business, but was afterwards withdrawn owing to the premises being found to be unsuitable for the purpose. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. There are two cowkeepers, five dairymen, and forty-two purveyors of milk on the register. Eight applicatijns for registration as retailers of milk have been received and reported upon during the year. One person has discontinued keeping cows, and one dairy has been closed, the premises now being used for other purposes. Frequent inspections have been made of the cowsheds, dairies and milkshops, attention being given to the cleanliness of the premises, vessels and dairy appliances, and, with few exceptions, they were found to be well kept. In one instance, however, a retailer was in the habit of depositing milk in a building which was quite unsuitable for the purpose. As this was a contravention of the regulations, I reported the matter to the Council, who authorised me to caution the retailer, and no further action was taken. With a view to preventing the contamination of milk by flies, proper covers of suitable material has been insisted upon in the dairies and milkshops where milk is kept or exposed for sale. 31 COMMON LODGING HOUSES. The number of Common Lodging Houses in the District remains the same as last year, namely six, and they contain twenty nine rooms for sleeping purposes, and afford accommodation for 171 lodgers nightly. They have been inspected as occasion required and kept, as far as possible, in a clean condition. I am pleased to report that no cases of infectious disease have been notified at, or traced to, any of these houses. The old house in the Market Place which was formerly used as a common lodging house, has been demolished during the year. . SLAUGHTER HOUSES. There are ten slaughter houses in the district, two of which have been unoccupied for some time, but one will shortly be demolished. Of the eight in use four are legistered and the remainder are subject to annual renewal. One licensed slaughter house is used only for slaughtering horses and cattle therein not intended for butcher's meat, and the occupier also holds a license under the Knacker's Act. The slaughter houses have been frequently inspected, and in accordance with my usual practice, the visits were arranged to take place at such times that slaughtering was likely to be in progress. Attention was, given to the requirements of the bye laws, and I am pleased to say, that as a rule, these were well observed. fn December it came to my knowledge that the slaughtering of pigs was being carried on at the pig styes in Clayponds Lane, where some 200 pigs were housed, and on keeping observation it was found that pigs were being slaughtered on the premises, the blood therefrom discharging into a collection of water. As the pig styes were not properly drained and the liquid filth was entering the pond contrary to the bye laws, the occupier was given notice to cease keeping pigs, and he subsequently disposed of the whole of the stock within the time specified in the notice, and 110 further action was taken. INFECTIOUS DISEASE & DISINFECTION. During the year 104 cases of Infectious Disease have been investigated and reported upon to the Medical Officer of Health. Forty-six rooms have been disinfected upon the removal, recovery or death of a patient. Twenty-one rooms have been stripped and cleansed as required by section 5 of the Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act 1890. 32 Reference to Table I. shows the precautions taken in order to prevent the spread of disease.

During the year 49 Canal Boats have been inspected. I am pleased to report that the condition of the boats and their occupants was satisfactory. The infringements of the Acts and Regulations detected were few and not of serious nature. They were as follows :— Cabin leaking 1 Absence of water vessel 2 Marking 1 Overcrowding 1 Painting 2 No Certificate produced 1 Boat not registered in accordance with the Act 1 No legal proceedings have been taken in respect of any infringements. Three complaint notes were issued, two of which have been returned to me signed by an Officer appointed under the Canal Boat Act. Likewise I have signed two complaint notes issued by neighbouring authorities and also attended to various other requirements. No cases of infectious disease have been notified upon any of the boats and therefore it has not been necessary to detain any vessel for the purpose of cleansing and disinfection. Two canal boats have been registered during the year, one being a motor driven boat. The number of boats on the register believed to be in use or available is 301 The number of boats that cannot be traced is 14 Total 315 34 PETROLEUM ACT, 1881, AND ORDERS IN COUNCIL THEREUNDER. These Acts provide for the safe keeping of petroleum, which when tested in the manner prescribed by Schedule One of the Act, gives off an inflammable vapour at a temperature below 73◦ Fahr. Petroleum having a flash point below this figure must be stored under the provisions of a license, except when kept in separate pint vessels, the quantity kept not exceeding three gallons, or when kept for fuel for light locomotives under the Secretary of State's Regulations, the limit then being sixty gallons, in two-gallon vessels for one store house. During the year five applications for licenses to keep petroleum and one for permission to increase the amount of petroleum kept from 1000 to 2000 gallons were received and reported upon. The latter application was refused and in the other cases the licenses were granted on the usual conditions. Eight notices have been received from owners of motor cars giving notice of their intention to keep motor spirit under the Provisions of the Secretary of State's Regulations made pursuant to Section 5 of the Locomotives on Highways Act, 1896. The licensed premises, stores, and motor garages have been inspected, and the conditions upon which the licenses were granted, have been with few exceptions, well carried out. In one instance, however, having reasonable cause to believe that motor spirit was being kept at the Cinematograph Theatre, Market Place, I obtained a warrant from the Justices to enter the premises and to search for petroleum therein. A quantity of motor spirit found on the premises was seized and a summons was preferred against the occupier for keeping petroleum without a license from the Council. The defendant was fined £5 and £1 2s. costs and the petroleum forfeited. Other contraventions of the Acts and Orders have formed the subject of special reports. Twelve licenses are now in force covering 3266 gallons of Petroleum Spirit. During the year fourteen samples of oils have been purchased and tested all of which were found to be above the flash point prescribed by the Act. CONCLUSION. In conclusion I desire to express my appreciation of the support which has been extended to me by every member of the Council and the Medical Officer of Health in my efforts to carry out the oft times difficult and dangerous duties which I am called upon to perform. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. COLEMAN, Sanitary Inspector. 35 TABLE I. PRECAUTIONS TAKEN AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASE.
