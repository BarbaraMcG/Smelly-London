W. 1. September, 1963 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting to you my Annual Report on the health, vital statistics and sanitary circumstances of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras for the year 1962. In accordance with the request of the Minister of Health, the report is presented in the same general form as has been done for some years past. Most of the vital statistics contained herein do not call for particular comment. The population of the Borough has continued the steady decline that has been apparent since 1949 and the recent census figures show a fall of nearly 14,000 since 1951. The illegitimate birth rate has risen by some 20 per cent. to a figure of 388 in the past year. A similar increase has occurred in almost all London boroughs and is, I think, in a large measure due to the anonymity and opportunities of work which London can offer the unmarried mother from elsewhere. Whilst deaths from cancer have fallen slightly during the past year, there has been a rise from 70 to 97 in deaths from cancer of the lung and associated structures, such lesions now forming almost a third of deaths from malignant disease. In this connection it is apposite to mention the Health Education Campaign which was conducted in the Borough in October 1962 taking the form of a 'Smoking and Health Week'. Amobile van was provided by the Central Council for Health Education who also gave us the services of a number of trained speakers on this theme and meetings were held which were attended by the public and additionally lectures and demonstrations were given in local schools. Whilst all aspects of health education have continued to expand, particular mention should be made of the Home Safety Week held in September 1962 during which film shows were given in the children's libraries and old folk's clubs; several shops gave space for window displays; resuscitation demonstrations were given and leaflets distributed through many private and public agencies. Special attention was given to water safety and as a result of the course organised, twenty-nine children were presented by the Mayor with swimming proficiency certificates. Campaigns were also carried out during the year pointing out the dangers from broken glass and fireworks. The work of S.P.A.C.A. has continued to Increase and this year has seen the establishment of a luncheon club in Lady Margaret Road. This has proved a very successful venture. The club has been well attended from the start and is currently at almost full capacity, serving some 60-70 lunches each day. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the many members of the Town Hall staff who have helped in the work done by S.P.A.C.A. On many occasions they have given generously of their time and expert knowledge to members of my department and have always proved most willing to deal with the varied problems with which we have presented them. l In my last report I mentioned the case of smallpox which was imported into the Borough at the end of 1961. Fortunately no secondary cases occurred from this importation and in this respect I would like to thank all members of the staff of my Department who worked long hours with unfailing cheerfulness and so helped to ensure that the disease did not spread. In mid-January, in response to an overwhelming public demand it was found necessary to establish a vaccination clinic in the Town-Hall for three days, this being later moved to the Public Health Annexe. During this time some 12, 000 members of the public were vaccinated and I am grateful to all the staff of the Borough Council who so readily offered help and without whose assistance it would have been impossible to meet the public demand. In conclusion may I acknowledge once again the close co-operation and help the Public Health Department received from the Medical Practitioners in the Borough and from all those officials, both of voluntary and national bodies, with whom at one time or other during the year we are in contact. I thank the members of the Council and particularly the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their interest and encouragement in the work of the Public Health Department throughout the year. Lastly, I wish to record my sincere thanks to all the members of my own staff for their co-operation, interest in the work of the Department and the health and welfare of the people in the Borough. I beg to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, SUSAN M. TRACY, Medical Officer of Health ii METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.
