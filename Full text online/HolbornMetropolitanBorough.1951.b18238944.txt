The London County Council, as Local Health Authority, is responsible under Section 27 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, for the provision of ambulance facilities within the Administrative County of London. The Home Service Ambulance Department (Order of St. John of Jerusalem and British Red Cross Society) and the Hospital Car Service act as agents of the County Council in supplying some of the ambulance and car transport provided under the Act. The Headquarters of the London Ambulance Service are at The County Hall, Westminster Bridge, S.E.1. Ambulances may be summoned as follows:— (1) Accidents— Sudden illness in the streets, public places or places of employment. (Note—For sudden illness in the home a doctor, not an ambulance, should be summoned. (2) Maternity patients (who have booked a bed in a hospital or maternity home)— Very urgent illness in the home (provided a medical practitioner certifies that the case is one of life or death and arrangements have been made with a hospital for the patient's admission). Dial "999" (or follow the instructions given on the telephone instrument) and ask for— "AMBULANCE." Telephone— WATerloo 6000 CENtral 6301 REGent 4000 RELiance 3622 or NEW Cross 2645. 10 (3) Illness, infectious disease, etc.— Normally the hospital to which the patient is to be admitted will summon the ambulance, if one is necessary, by telephoning WATerloo 3811. This applies also to patients being discharged from hospital or attending there as out-patients. Emergency Bed Service. (King Edward's Hospital Fund for London). The Emergency Bed Service was founded in 1938 to assist general practitioners in finding beds for acute emergency cases. Since the 5th July, 1948, the Service, working in close co-operation with the Ambulance Service, has acted as agent for the four Metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards for the admission of all types of cases except mental and tuberculous. Since the 3rd October, 1939, the Central Office of the Emergency Bed Service at Old Jewry (MONarch 3000) has dealt with cases from the Central London area only, from 8.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily (including Sundays), branch offices having been established to deal with the outer part of Greater London. At night a full service is available at the Central Office for the whole of Greater London. 11 SECTION 2. Births and Deaths. STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1951. Population.

The numbers of either males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have not shewn any uniform trend during these last six years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table does however show the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that these neoplasms produce a wastage of life practically equal to that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 17 SECTION 3.

Recent Legislation. Puerperal Pyrexia Regulations, 1951. These Regulations which came into operation on 1st August, 1951, revoke the Puerpeial Pyrexia Regulations, 1939, and the Public Health (Notification of Puerperal Fever and Puerperal Pyrexia) Regulations, 1926 and 1928. The new Regulations continue the effect of the revoked Regulations making puerperal fever a notifiable disease, the only major modification being in the definition of puerperal pyrexia. This has been amended to "Any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4° F. or more has occurred within fourteen days after child birth or miscarriage." Public Health (Leprosy) Regulations, 1951. These Regulations which came into operation on 22nd June, 1951, require every medical practitioner who is attending, or called in to visit a person suffering from leprosy to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health by sending him a certificate in the form set out in the Schedule to the Regulations. The Regulations are enforced and the certificates provided by local authorities. During the year 406 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 92 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 20). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1920-1951 are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 22 and 23. Diphtheria. It is very gratifying to report that for the first time in the history of the Borough no case of diphtheria was notified. This result is a fitting tribute to the work done in Holborn which was the first Metropolitan Authority to start immunisation clinics thirty years ago. There is one less satisfactory aspect in that fewer persons have been immunised this year. Graph No. 3, facing this page, shows a comparison between the incidence of diphtheria and the number of persons immunised against diphtheria during the years 1920 to 1951. Dysentery. Thirty-four cases were notified and fourteen were removed to hospital. Erysipelas. One case was notified and was nursed at home. GRAPH No. 3. DIPHTHERIA, 1920-1951. \To face page 18. 19 Food Poisoning. Two cases due to salmonella typhi-murium were notified and were removed to hospital. Malaria. One case was notified and was removed to hospital. The patient was a man aged 31, who had just arrived in this country from Nigeria. Measles. Two hundred and fifty-four cases were notified, and twenty-one were removed to hospital. One case removed to hospital was subsequently re-diagnosed as dermatitis. Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal). Eight cases were notified, and four were removed to hospital. Puerperal Pyrexia. In August a new and wider definition was adopted for this condition by the Puerperal Pyrexia Regulations, 1951. Three cases were notified during the year and were removed to hospital. Scabies. Four cases were notified, all of which were treated at home. Scarlet Fever. Twenty-one cases were notified, and eight of them were removed to hospital. One case removed to hospital was subsequently re-diagnosed as catarrhal pharyngitis. Smallpox. In February, a ship arrived at Tilbury with a case of suspected smallpox—a child aged 12 years. The case was confirmed, and 26 passengers presumed to be contacts were kept under observation for a period of 16 days. In May, a ship arrived in the Port of London having landed a case of modified smallpox at Marseilles. Nineteen passengers presumed to be contacts were kept under observation for a period of 16 days.

Summary of work carried out in respect of nuisances found to exist in dwelling houses, houses let in lodgings, offices, shops, factories, food premises, on building construction sites and on bombed sites: — Water Supply. Proper and sufficient supply provided 22 Burst water service pipes repaired 2 Waterclosets. Cleansed 21 Water supplied, flushing cistern repaired 15 Repaired, new pans provided 17 Position or construction improved 4 Accommodation provided 8 Unstopped 3 Soil pipes.

Roofs repaired 48 Gutters repaired 13 Other works to prevent dampness 25 Ash bins, and Ashpits. Provided, repaired 5 Various. Accumulations of refuse removed 20 Emission of black smoke abated 2 Overcrowding abated 1 Other defects 21 Complaints. During the year 852 complaints were received in respect of the following nuisances: — Aged and infirm persons 2 Animals improperly kept 6 Artificial lighting, absence on common staircase 4 Dampness 60 Dilapidations and disrepair 83 Drains choked or defective 25 Dust 2 Dustbin accommodation inadequate or unsuitable 6 Flues defective . 6 Food premises, unsatisfactory conditions in 9 Noise 8 Overcrowding 2 Obnoxious smells 81 Refuse, accumulations of 40 Rodent infestation 369 Roofs defective 23 Smoke 11 Unsound food 14 Ventilation inadequate 2 Vermin 80 Water supply inadequate 4 W.C. accommodation inadequate, dirty or defective 47 Miscellaneous 375 28 Water. 1. Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metro- politan Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. Drainage. During the year 3,424 inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 97 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 96 Combined Drainage Orders were made. Smoke Abatement. During the year 11 complaints were received regarding smoke nuisances and 171 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Sanitary Inspectors. In two cases it was found necessary to serve Notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Bombed Sites. Accumulations of refuse on bombed sites present a considerable problem to local authorities. In very few cases are the accumulations such as to warrant the service of notice in respect of a "nuisance"; and there is also the difficulty of assessing responsibility for the accumulations. In 1949 the Council made a by-law governing fly tipping on vacant sites in the Borough, but considerable difficulty is experienced in tracing offendersSites treated by Council, e.g., bedding removed 19 Sites cleared as a result of the service of notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 4 War-Time Reservoirs for Emergency Water Supplies. The war-time reservoirs for emergency water supplies were kept under observation throughout the summer months, with a view to the prevention of nuisance, and in particular to prevent the breeding of insects. Where necessary, arrangements were made for accumulations of water to be pumped out by the London Fire Brigade. It is pleasing to note that with the increase in rebuilding a number of these potential sources of nuisance have disappeared. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act and the Poisons Rules, 1949, regulate the sale of poisons, and every local authority is required to keep a list of persons who are entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. During the year 1951, 34 applications were received for retention on this Council's list. Two applications were received for entry on the list and one for removal. 29 Rag Fi.ock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act and the Regulations of 1951, require the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in connection with certain upholstering and filling processes, and require premises used for the manufacture or storage of rag flock to be licensed.

Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, provides that, where certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be necessary for the purpose of securing the proper care and attention for persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention, a local authority may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an order to secure the removal of such aged and infirm persons. There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Section by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951. Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, provides that seven clear days' notice must be given to a person, in need of care and attention, before an application can be made by the local authority to a court of summary jurisdiction for his removal to and maintenance in a suitable hospital or other place, subject to accomodation being available. This Amending Act of 1951 provides an alternative procedure. On a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner an order may be made without prior notice either by a court of summary jurisdiction or by a single justice for the removal of such person, subject to accommodation being available. Burial of the Dead. Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. During the year ten cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £94 17s. 6d, of which £21 13s. Id. was recovered, leaving a net cost to the Council of £67 4s. 5d.

Hydrogen Cyanide (Fumigation of Buildings) Regulations, 1951. These Regulations, which came into operation on 1st February, 1952, revoke the Hydrogen Cyanide (Fumigation of Buildings) Regulations, 1938. Before commencing a fumigation, an operator is now required to give a signed statement to the occupier regarding the precautionary measures required by the Regulations to be observed, and on completion of the fumigation, a certificate to the effect that all necessary safety measures have 36 been taken. Provision is made regarding the composition of the fumigant and containers, regarding precautions to be taken in transferring fumigant from one container to another; and for the necessity of having protective apparatus and first aid equipment available. Pet Animals Act, 1951. This Act, which received the Royal Assent on 22nd June, 1951, and came into operation on the 1st April of the current year, makes it an offence for a pet shop to be kept except under the authority of a licence granted by a county borough, metropolitan borough or county district council. It also makes it an offence to sell animals as pets in any part of a street or public place except at a stall or barrow in a market, or to sell an animal as a pet to a person where there might be reasonable cause to believe the person to be under the age of twelve years. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. The object of this Act is to secure the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles which are stuffed or lined. It repeals the Rag Flock Acts, 1911 and 1928, and Section 136 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Premises where certain specified filling materials are used in connection with the stuffing of bedding and toys, the lining of baby carriages, etc., are required to be registered by a local authority, and premises used for the storage or manufacture of rag flock are required to be licensed by a local authority. The fee in each case is £1. The authority may refuse to grant or renew a licence if it appears to them that the premises are not sufficiently equipped to ensure that clean rag flock is manufactured or stored. It is the duty of a local authority to secure the inspection of registered or licensed premises as often as necessary, and power is given for an authorised officer to enter such premises, or premises which he believes should be registered or licensed, at all reasonable times to inspect the materials or articles found therein. Provision is also made for the taking of samples of the filling materials and their submission to the public analyst for testing. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Regulations, 1951. The Regulations, which came into operation on 1st November, 1951, prescribe standards of cleanliness for each kind of filling material to which the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951, applies. The Regulations also specify the prescribed analysts for the purpose of tests under the Act, and fix the fees which may be charged by any analyst making such a test, and the form in which a certificate of the results is to be given. They also prescribe the form in which records are to be kept by occupiers of premises registered or licensed under the Act. 37 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council. Particulars of inspections and other work carried out during 1951 are as follows: — Number of visits to: — Factories with mechanical power 257 Factories without mechanical power 51 Outworkers' rooms 37 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 57 Notices served: — Factories Acts, 1937 & 1948.

The Milk and Dairies Regulations require every Local Authority to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises which are used as dairies. "Dairy" does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or 42 other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. "Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies. Dairies registered during 1951 Nil Dairies on register at end of 1951 3 Distributors registered during 1951 8 Distributors removed from register during 1951 12 Distributors on register at end of 1951 67 Number of above distributors trading from premises outside Borough 25 Inspections made by Inspectors during 1951 32 Formal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 214 Informal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 3 During 1951, 214 formal samples of milk were taken, one of which was found to contain at least 3.1% added water.

A person proposing to use a special designation authorised by the Regulations is required to apply to the licensing authority of the area in which the milk is to be sold, for a licence to use the designation. Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area from which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributor holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area. During the year 148 licences were issued, details of which are as follows: — Dealer's Licences. Dealer's Supplementary Licences. To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 19 20 To sell Accredited milk — 1 To sell Pasteurised milk 40 25 To sell Sterilised milk 23 20 Milk — Bacteriological Examination. During the year, 81 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination. Five of these were from milk supplied to schools in the Borough and one to a Day Nursery. In addition four samples were subjected to the animal inoculation test but no evidence of tubercle bacilli was observed on post mortem examination six weeks after inoculation. 44 Registration of Premises Used for the Manufacture, Storage or Sale of Ice Cream. Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1951, five premises were registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream in Holborn, and sixty premises were registered for storage and sale. During the year, twelve applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale. Three sets of premises ceased to be used for the storage and sale of ice cream, and were removed from the register. It came to the notice of the department, that of the five premises registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, only one was being used for manufacture. The other four owners agreed that the registrations in respect of manufacture be cancelled. At the end of the year, therefore, there was one registration for manufacture, storage and sale, and 73 premises were registered for storage and sale. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, Etc.) Regulations, 1947. During the year 77 samples of ice cream were submitted for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows: — Grade 1 32 Grade 2 17 Grade 3 11 Grade 4 14 Three samples were coloured ices which did not respond to the test. These samples were examined for the presence of faecal coli, which in each case were found to be absent in 1 ml. of the sample. In addition four iced "lollies" were submitted for examination for the presence of faecal coli, which in each case were found to be absent in 1 ml. of the sample. 43.2% of the samples graded were Grade 1. This was an improvement on the results for the previous three years, details of which are: — Year. % of Samples Grade 1. 1948 17.5% 1949 15.3% 1950 29.8% In the case of samples falling within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading. In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. The results of all examinations of their own products were for warded to the large manufacturers for their information. 45 Licensed Premises. There are 77 public houses in the Borough, and during the year 93 inspections and 45 re-inspections were carried out. Nine notices were served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and twelve notices were served under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. In addition, 60 reports were submitted to the Licensing Justices, in respect of premises where application had been made for the grant, re-grant or transfer of a licence under the Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910.

The Holborn Clean Food Guild, which was formed in January, 1950, had another successful year during 1951. During the year 28 applications were received for membership, bringing the total applications received to 112. Of these. 69 have been approved for membership, 28 of them during 1951 There remained 40 applicants in varying stages of progress towards the necessary standard required for registration, some of whom have been registered during the current year. Renewal of membership was requested from all the thirty-nine members eligible for re-election during the year; indicating their appreciation of the work of the Guild in connection with their business. In each case the necessary standard was found to be maintained, and the renewal of membership was granted. 50 The Executive Committee continued to do everything within its power to extend the Guild's publicity, and several attractive ideas were put into practice. The work of the Guild continued to arouse interest among local authorities and other bodies interested in food hygiene. It is interesting to report that requests for information concerning the Guild were received from as far distant as Pretoria, South Africa, and Sydney, Australia, and visitors to Holborn, some from abroad, from time to time called requesting information. As in 1950, the Holborn Borough Council were very helpful throughout the year in publicising clean food in accordance with the powers conferred upon them by the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, for the publication of information relating to health and the prevention of disease.

The campaign for the early detection of Tuberculosis was continued during the year by Mass X-Ray Unit II of the North-West Regional Hospital Board. Facilities were afforded to persons living or working in Holborn for X-ray examination of chest and lungs during March, April and May, 1951. A large number of firms in the Borough were invited to allow their employees to undergo examination by the Unit, and the managements proved very co-operative. So great was the response that it was found necessary to include some volunteers in later programmes held elsewhere. The following are particulars giving the results of the examinations: — Analysis of Survey of Persons Working in the Borough. No. of persons examined Men. Women.
