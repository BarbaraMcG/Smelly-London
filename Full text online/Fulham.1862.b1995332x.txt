The Board of Works for the Fulham District, in compliance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, submit to the Parishioners a statement of their proceedings in the execution of the various powers vested in them, and an Account in Abstract, of Contracts, Receipts, and Expenditure, for the year ending 25th March, 1863, together with the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of cases of Nuisances removed during the same period:— Privies and cesspools emptied 347 Drains and gullies cleansed and repaired 309 Houses ditto ditto 79 Swine nuisances removed 5 Miscellaneous 108 848 Houses benefited in Fulham 528 ,, „ Hammersmith 482 1010 The Board acting upon the belief that the District under their charge would not take its proper place as an integral part of the Metropolis unless a complete system of drainage is carried out therein, have repeatedly urged upon the Metropolitan Board of Works to construct their main and intercepting scheme of sewers, and thus give to the Board those facilities necessary to that end, and they have now to report that such intercepting scheme has been commenced and is proceeding rapidly towards completion. The Board have during the past year constructed in the New Road, Hammersmith, a sewer, at the cost of £876 15s. 11c?., the money (£1000) for which was raised by loan from the British Empire Mutual Life Assurance Company at 4£ -per cent, interest, repayable by twenty annual instalments of £70 17s. Grf. each. An abstract of the mortgage therein is annexed hereto. It is with satisfaction the Board have to state that most of the owners of property along the line of sewer have availed themselves of the advantage thus afforded to effectually drain their premises. 5 The Board have also engaged to construct a new sewer from the Creek to the Broadway, and are taking measures to borrow the money so that the work may be performed by the ensuing autumn. At the time when the Metropolitan Board of Works were about to commence their plan for the Western Drainage, it came to the knowledge of the Board of Works for the Fuiham district that such plans contemplated the bringing of the sewage of nearly the whole of the parishes of Kensington and Chelsea, as well as the whole of the sewage of Hammersmith and Fuiham, to Sand's End, to be there deodorized, and thence to run the deodorized matter into the river Thames at a point not far Westward of Cremorne Gardens. The Board, supported by the opinion of the district, of the medical officer of health, and a large body of scientific gentlemen, considering that this scheme would create a nuisance most extensive and injurious to health and property in the neighbourhood, determinedly opposed the same, and they are happy to state with complete success, by causing its abandonment. The Metropolitan Board have since agreed to carry the sewage above mentioned into the low-level sewer to Barking Creek, making a temporary outlet at Counter's Creek until such low-level sewer is constructed. The Board are happy to report that they have at last succeeded in removing the whole of the small cottage property called "Little Wapping," and have thus given facilities for a carriage road direct from the Lower Mall to the centre of Hammersmith; and further that they have obtained the consent of the copyholder, Mr. Denny, and the leaseholder, Mr. Soper, to the setting back of a house in King Street West, on the payment of the sum of £180, thus effecting a great improvement much needed in that part of the town. During the past year the Board received an application from the office of Stamps and Taxes for the use of a room at Broadway House, as an office to conduct the business in that department for this district, and they have let a room for that purpose at the rent of £25 per annum, including attendance. The Board have also arranged that the Kensington Vestry should repair the Hammersmith portion of the Norland Road for the sum of £35 per annum. During the last Session of Parliament an Act was passed to amend the Metropolis Local Management Act, in which was incorporated many suggestions from this Board, particularly those relating to the paving of New Streets and the redistribution of the debts of the Commissioners of Sewers. By the provisions of the Act relating to this latter subject a sum of £3,198 18s. 3d. has to be returned to Hammersmith, which has been duly credited in the books of the Metropolitan Board to that parish, to be employed in liquidation of future precepts, which it is estimated will exempt Hammersmith for a period of two years from the payment of the general precepts of that Board, besides reducing the charges in future 6 A corresponding reduction in the amount of the outstanding precepts in the parish of Fulham, has also to be made. By means of such Act they are now also enabled to deal with cases like that of the Latymer Road and Masboro' Road North, in respect of which they have already taken action, and hope to have such places in a state of repair satisfactory to the owners and the public. At an early period of the present Session of Parliament, the Metropolis Trust Commissioners having introduced a Bill providing for the removal of Tollgates and Bars in the Metropolis, and throwing the entire cost of the future maintenance of such roads on the parishes through which they pass, the Board have earnestly striven to obtain a more equitable settlement in that matter. During the past year they have had to regret the death of their late colleague, V. Stevens, Esq., who represented the District at the Metropolitan Board from the commencement of the Act, but are happy to report that they have found an efficient substitute, having elected W. H. Lammin, Esq., of "The Shorrolds," Fuiham, to supply the vacant place. abstract of contracts entehed into by the board during the year ending 25th march, 1863.

We hereby certify that we have carefully examined the accounts and books of accounts of the Board of Works for the Fuiham District, for the year ending 25th March, 1863, and have compared them with the Vouchers, and find the several receipts and entries thereof, to be correct; we also certify to the correctness of the abstract of accounts, together with the assets and liabilities to the several parishes. We found a balance at the bankers at the commencement of the year of the sum of £814 19s. 9d, and at the close of the audit we leave a balance of £1763 3s 0d.; on analyzing which we find of this sum £701 12s. 6d. in favor of Fulham, and £1061 10s. 6d in favor of Hammersmith, the liabilities of each parish being clearly shewn in the abstracts to be published. We feel constrained to remark on the fact that so large an amount remains due to the Fuiham Board of Guardians for broken granite. We consider such accounts should be rendered quarterly to meet the public convenience. (Signed,) THOMAS BRETT CHESTER,} WILLIAM MUSSARED,} Auditors. HENRY Wm. KEYS.} Board Room, Broadway House, 29th May, 1863. 9 SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Board of Works, Fulham District. Gentlemen, In my Report for the year 1861, I stated the number of inhabitants of the Fulham District to be 39,951 as taken at the Census, figures which were derived from Returns of the Registrars to myself. In the Registrar General's weekly return of January 4th, 1862, the numbers were placed at 40,042, but in his summary for 1861, he has altered them to 40,058, which latter, I presume, have been estimated from a subsequent revision of the Enumerators' Schedules and may, I think, be taken as correct. The number of inhabitants then of the Fuiham District at the last Census (1861) will stand thus:—St. Peter, Hammersmith, 5,415; St. Paul, Hammersmith, 19,104; Fuiham, 15,539. Total, 40,058. In 1811, the population of Fuiham was only 5,903, and of Hammersmith 7,393, making a total of 13,296, shewing that whilst Fuiham has increased 163.2 perCent. on its then number of inhabitants, Hammersmith has attained to 231.6 perCent. in the same period of time. In the 10 years, 1851 to 1861, this rate of increase was somewhat altered, for, whilst Fuiham enlarged its population during that period 30.7 perCent. on its then numbers, Hammersmith only reached 27.5 perCent. The features of the several populations have, however, much modified this relatively beneficial result to Fuiham, since in Hammersmith the population has been augmented principally by persons of a moderate grade in society, whilst that of Fuiham, unfortunately, has received its additions chiefly from the lower and labouring classes. The cause of this somewhat undesirable change is clearly traceable to immigration. The enlarging of the Gas Works has produced an increased demand for labour; a more highly cultivated , condition of the Market Garden and Nursery Grounds has likewise in this manner contributed; the profitable nature of pig-keeping has led to the establishment of extensive piggeries affording maintenance to numerous families, to say nothing of many manufactures of a have swamped the additions derived from the better classes. 10 The total Mortality for the year has been 922 which is very slightly higher than in 1861,* but it is satisfactory to observe that the increase has not arisen from diseases of a zymotic character. Tubercular affections, diseases of the organs of respiration, and developmental diseases of children (including premature birth and teething), constituting the chief excess. Of the 922 deaths 101, or about 10 per Cent., died between 70 and 80 years, 47 or 5 perCent, between 80 and 90 years, whilst one had attained to 94 years. It is, of course, impossible to trace the histories of the aged persons who from year to year die in the Fuiham. District, but there is reason to believe that a large proportion are natives or persons who have spent a great number of years in the locality, thus proving its natural tendency to longevity. But when we review the other end of the scale we cannot otherwise than observe how much man does himself to counteract such a gift of nature. It certainly could not have been intended by Providence that of all the children born nearly one-half should die without attaining one-fourteenth part of the three score years and ten allotted to mankind, and yet we see the yearly realization of this astounding fact. My previous reports have shown how our own infant population has thus been summarily disposed of, and this year indicates how death is still at work amongst them. The returns of Mortality prove that of the 922 deaths during the year, 378 or 41 per Cent, had not passed beyond their 5th year, whilst 194 had actually died under one year of age. The prevailing causes of this infant destruction are ranged under the following heads. Miasmatic diseases, 126; Tubercular, 40; Diseases of the Nervous System, 41; Diseases of the Organs of Respiration, 59; Developmental diseases and diseases of Nutrition, 70: causes which evidently point to something radically wrong in the care and nurture of the infant community. Of the Zymotic classes of disease, Scarlatina has produced the largest number of deaths, 53, viz: 38 in Fuiham, and 15 in Hammersmith, but Hooping Cough which destroyed 52 in 1861, only claimed 14. Diarrhoea, again, in 1861,caused death to 47, but during the past year to 30 only. 17 fatal cases of Diptheria have been recorded also during the year, and of Ague 1. 28 have died of various forms of Continued Fever, 14 from Measles, and 88 from Phthisis. Of the 922 deaths in the District upwards of 500 have occurred amongst the working classes Of the total deaths, 491 occurred in Hammersmith, and 431 in Fuiham. The rate of Mortality for the year, calculated for increase of population to the middle of the year, was 2.25 per Cent., the rate for the whole of London having been 2.349. The greatest number of deaths were registered in March (108) and in December (102). • In consequence of a delay in the Registration, the deaths of three persons on whom Inquests were held were omitted in my last year's Report, the total Mortality of which was therefore 901. 11 The former month was characterized by great vicissitudes of temperature, the range of the Thermometer during the first week having been no less than 39.6, from 60.7 the highest day temperature, to 21.1 the lowest at night. During the middle of the month the temperature was about 4° above the average, whilst the last week was marked by high day and low night temperatures, the mean being about 5° above the average. In this month the greater number of deaths arose from Zymotic and Tubercular diseases, and diseases of the Organs of Respiration. Although the Mortality of December was high the mean temperature of the month was above the average, but the vicissitudes were great with a humid condition of the atmosphere and it had been preceded by a cold November considerably below the average temperature, and consequently, as might be anticipated, the larger number of deaths arose from Tubercular diseases and those of the Respiratory Organs. It is interesting also to observe that whilst the mortality of all London rose to its highest point in the last week of November that of Fuiham District was delayed to the last week in December. A special absence of ozone was noted in November. In the early part of the year some uneasiness was created by the occurrence of several deaths in the Union House from a low form of Fever. The cases were confined to the male side of the House, and principally affected the aged and infirm. By the prompt and efficient arrangements of the Medical Officer and the Master, the Epidemic was soon cut short. Some defective drains were at the same time discovered and remedied. The deaths in Lunatic Asylums have been 14, in Aims-Houses, 24, and in the Union House 76. 42 Inquests have been held. St. Peter's District, Hammersmith (population 5,415), still retains its usual salubrity. In 9 weeks of the past year no deaths were registered, and in 13 weeks of the year only 1 death was recorded in each. The number of Births has been 1,411, showing an excess of births over deaths of 489. Of drainage works in connection with Sanitary matters, the principal have been the construction of a short line of sewer in the New Road, Hammersmith, and the subsequent drainage of nearly all the contiguous houses into it, a circumstance of incalculable advantage to that neighbourhood. In Fuiham it is only necessary to refer to the commencement of the Main Drainage Works and the successful results of the efforts of your Board in averting from that Parish a grievous injury by the contemplated erection of deodorizing works at Sand's End. FULHAM CHURCH YARD. During the year, the overcrowded condition of Fuiham Church Yard has been brought under the notice of the Authorities, and complaints have been made respecting it. I was consequently requested by Mr. Grainger, the Government Inspector, to examine 12 and report upon it. There does not appear to be any correct record of the building of Fulham Church, but it is supposed to have been erected about the beginning of the 15th century. For upwards of 400 years, therefore, we may presume that this ground has been in use for the burial of the dead. As will be seen from my Report (which, as it was of an official character, I append hereto), its condition is such as to call for judicial interference. For full 200 years it received the dead both from Hammersmith and Fulham. The earliest record now extant, beginning in the year 1G75, shews the average burials for the following five years, in the two places, to have been 123. Since that time the entries relating to each Parish have been kept separately, and during ten years, 1680-1689, the average burials for Fulham alone appear to have been 88. In 1809 they had only increased to 115, but in the year ending March 25th, 1863, they numbered 271. An order in Council has now been issued for its closure, a copy of which is appended hereto. COW-HOUSES. During the year the Act has come into operation enforcing the Licensing of Cow-houses. The whole of these places were duly inspected and reported on to your Board, and, with two or three exceptions, Licenses granted. A recent inspection has shown that since the adoption of this system a considerable improvement has been effected in many of them which were previously in a very unwholesome condition. The necessity for a Sanitary supervision over this branch of trade is shown by the fearful mortality which has been known to prevail in many of the London cow-houses. The annual loss to the proprietors has been in numerous instances even ruinous, whilst the continual slaughtering of animals in an advanced stage of disease for human food has been carried to a fearful extent. On this subject the association of Medical Officers of Health has recorded the following opinion "The Association has information that a very serious amount of disease exists among the cows of the London Dairies, and that such animals are habitually slaughtered and used as food. Further, that a large number of diseased animals are daily imported into London and are exposed in the markets, their disease being often of a contagious character; these, also, are killed in the various slaughter-houses of London. The Association also has reason to believe that much disease is produced in the human subject by the consumption of the meat of such animals. The Association desires, therefore, to record its opinion that a more complete system of inspection, both at places of import and at the markets is required; and also, that opportunities are urgently needed for the systematic inspection of all animals at the time of slaughtering." WELL WATERS. By direction of the Sanitary Committee I have been engaged in 13 i an examination of the Well Waters of the District. The inquiries have embraced, 1st.—the waters of the public pumps; 2ndly,—those from private wells, and 3rdly,—those from artesian springs of great depth. With regard to the 1st.—they are nearly all derived from surface wells of very little depth, they contain for the most part a very large quantity of impurity, both organic and inorganic, derived from the soil, and, in many instances, there is unmistakeable evidence of direct percolation from adjoining cesspools. A considerable part of the cottage property of the district is entirely without a supply ox water, but wherever it is obtained by pumps the water is invariably bad, and in Fuiham particularly so, from the highly manured condition of the large area used as Market garden ground. Even the Public Pumps, though they can not be otherwise regarded than as a boon (in lieu of better things), supply a water highly charged with impurity. The table below shows the results of my examinations, and seriously points to the conclusion that an improved water supply for the Fuiham District is indeed a necessity. It is even fair to infer that a great part of the sickness and mortality from Diarrhoea which annually arises may have its principal origin in this cause. I have felt it my duty from time to time to urge upon your notice the great advantage which would arise from an extension of the water-mains through both Hammersmith and Fuiham. The Chelsea, Grand Junction, and West Middlesex Water Works severally pass partially through the District, and I cannot too strongly recommend that some immediate steps be taken to induce these Companies to lay down mains through most of the principal thoroughfares. The new system of Sewerage will indeed render such a step not only desirable, but absolutely necessary, if we are to derive the full benefit of the improvement. The importance of Public Water supply had not escaped the attention of Philanthropists in Fuiham even in the 17th century, for we find Sir Samuel Moreland gave a well, pump and iron ladle for public use at that time, a tablet with an inscription showing its object. From the table will be seen the qualities of the different waters available for our supply; and, whilst we ohserve that the surface wells hitherto in use have produced a water perfectly unfit for drinking, that to be derived from artesian springs and from the water companies is comparatively pure and wholesome: with such means then within our reach, shall we continue our present system? METEOROLOGY. The mean reading of the Barometer for the year has been 29.936. Only during the months of February, September, and December, has the mean reading been above 30 inches. Mean Temperature, 49.6. Mean Humidity, 82 (Saturation 100). Mean amount of Ozone, 2.4. Mean Cloud, 7.0. The total amount of Rain has been 26.45 Inches 14 which has fallen on 192 days. On the afternoon of Sunday, September 28th, during a violent storm, 2 inches of rain fell in about two hours. On the whole, it is most satisfactory to observe that, whilst other parts of the Metropolis, and even the Metropolis at large, have occasionally suffered more or less from some Epidemic disease, the Fuiham District has remained comparatively free, neither has its Mortality been excessive though its working people have not been exempt from ordinary privations. This favorable condition, however, must not engender indifference, since, with such a population, exposed to so many vicissitudes of life, the approach of Epidemic Sickness towards us, much more its existence amongst our neighbours, should warn us of the necessity for perseverance in preventive measures whilst the enemy is without, and thus may be avoided the panic that most surely results on the outbreak of such diseases as Small Pox, Fever or Cholera, which so quickly fasten on any community who disregard those precautions which science and experience point out as protective. It is not too much to say, that for position with desirability of soil and climate, the Fuiham District is not surpassed by any Metropolitan suburb. The completion of our main drainage will accomplish all that is necessary for carrying off our refuse, and it will be the fault of those most interested in its welfare if some of our cottage property remains in its present plague-tempting condition. If the comforts of the upper classes depend on the labour of the lower, it is equally certain that their immunity from prevailing sickness bears an equal relation to the sanitary condition of the latter. The improvement then of the dwellings of the poor, the establishment of Baths and Wash-houses, a prompt completion of the intended sewerage, and a larger extension of the Water supply, form the desiderata yet to be accomplished within the Fuiham District; and it is to be hoped, that not only will the public authorities but also the public individually and collectively give all possible aid in their realization, I have the honor to be, Gentleman, Your obedient servant, FREDERICK J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health, June 11th, 1863. Fuiham District. 15 At the Court at Windsor, the 20 th day of March, 1863. Present: The Queen's Most Excellent Majesty in Council. Where as the Right Honourable Sir George Grey, Bart., one of her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, after giving to the Incumbent and the Vestry Clerk of the Parishes hereinafter mentioned, ten days' previons notice of his intention to make such representation, has, under the provisions of an act, passed in the session of Parliament, held in the fifteenth and sixteenth years of her Majesty's reign, intituled "An Act to amend the laws concerning the burial of the dead in The Metropolis," made a representation stating that, for the protection of the public health, burials should be discontinued in the undermentioned parishes as follows, viz:— "FUlhaM.—Forthwith, with the exception of now existing family vaults and brick graves in the portion of the ancient church-yard lying on the southeast of the diagonal footpath, and marked A, B, C, D, on the plan which was transmitted to the Vestry Clerk of the Parish on the 14th of February, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three; and from and after the first day of July, 18G4, with the like exceptions, in the remaining portion of the ancient church-yard marked E on the above-named plan : the family vaults and graves above exempted to be used on the following conditions—that when required they be opened without disturbing soil that has already been buried in, that each coffin be embedded in powdered charcoal and separately entombed in an air-tight manner, and that the only bodies interred therein be those of the Husbands, Wives, Parents, unmarried Children, and Brothers,and Sisters of persons already buried therein. That in the new portion of the church-yard marked F in the above-mentioned plan, burials be conducted in accordance with the official regulations for new burial grounds." "FULHAM CHURCH-YARD. " Hammer smith, Dec, 22nd, 1802. "My dear Sir, "I am in receipt of yours of the 19th Instant with regard to the Fuiham Parish Church-yard,and before replying to it I have visited the spot this day, and had an interview with the Churchwardens, Sexton, &c. It may be well for me here to state that I have from time to time as Officer of Health inspected this Grave-yard, cousidering the time not far distant when it might be necessary to take some steps with reference to its being closed. About four or five years since I examined some well waters in the immediate locality, (John's Place,) and found them impregnated by filtration from the soil of the graveyard, but as these waters did not appear to be used for drinking purposes, and as no special sickness or mortality prevailed I did not take action. I find during the last year about 280 bodies have been buried here, a large proportion of which have been paupers. These interments have been principally confined to the western side of the ground and to the new portion added some few years since on the north. The surface of the centre portion of the grave-yard appears somewhat closely covered, though there are occasional vacant spaces. In this portion are several old family graves of the Parishioners. I have found to-day that very recently bodies, apparently of children, have been interred on that portion of the yard lying south of the Church contiguous to John's Place before referred to. This I consider objectionable and my opinion is that this portion of the ground should no longer be used, that interments should be limited to the new ground as railed in, and to that portion of the original grave-yard (under the bishop's Fence) west of the pathway running north and south through the ground. "I think it would be advisable to prohibit the use of the centre portion to those families already having burial places there, provided such graves or 16 vaultsbe not alrpady properly filled. I have made these suggestion. The Churchwarden who fully acquiesces in their propriety, and I have prom sed to seek an interview with the Board of Guardians for the purpose of making some provision for the burial of paupers elsewhere. I think with these restrictions that interments may be made for a short time longer, though I cannot otherwise consider such time must be limited.
