The health of the district continues to be very satisfactory. During the past year no severe outbreaks of any infectious disease occurred. The Birth Rate is a little higher than the previous year. The Death Rate and Infant Mortality Rate is a little up, but the latter is good compared with that (64) of England and Wales. I have to thank Mr. Nesfield, your Sanitary 6 Inspector, and the Officers of the Public Health Department for their assistance. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. H. LINZEE, Medical Officer of Health. 1.—GENERAL STATISTICS.
