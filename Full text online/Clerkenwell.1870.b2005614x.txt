In the table below, the number of deaths occurring in each of the last ten years is shown; and opposite are the number of births for the same years:— Deaths. Births. 1861 1494 2295 1862 1572 2287 1863 1509 2449 1864 1735 2224 1865 1613 2389 1866 1661 2434 1867 1497 2452 1868 1644 2478 1869 1512 2410 1870 1473 2415 It will also be seen that the births were 32 more than the average, and 5 more than in the preceding year. The sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred were as follows:— Deaths. Births. Excess. St. James 515 676+161. Amwell 352 620+268. Pentonville 249 493.+244. Goswell 357 626.+269. In each year, a certain number of the inhabitants of this parish, die in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums, situated outside the parish. The estimated number of these for the year 1870,is 101. The number of births being 2415, and the deaths 1473, the excess—or the natural increase of the population—amounted to 942. In the preceding year this was 898. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I hereby respectfully lay before you, my 15th Annual Report, for the year 1870. The number of deaths which arose from all causes, in 1870, was 1473. The average number of deaths for the last ten years is 1571; hence the deaths were 98 less than the average. And the number of deaths in 1869 being 1512, the deaths in 1870 were 39 less than those of the preceding year. 18 The number of deaths which arose from all the zymotic diseases in 1870 was 354; that of the preceding year being 370; hence a diminution of 16. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1870, was 320; being a diminution of 23 from the number of last year. The number and the causes of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the last ten years, are exhibited in the following table : Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhœa. Typhus. In Hospital. Totals. 1861 0 22 95 107 72 44 + 17 340 1862 1 76 133 53 42 70 + 9 375 1863 26 44 136 66 52 42 + 8 376 1864 7 73 94 71 87 46 + 9 378 1865 12 27 57 88 84 48 + 5 316 1S66 6 42 59 95 93 47 + 4 342 1867 20 44 49 35 71 50 269 1868 4 58 106 69 112 45 394 1869 0 28 116 81 74 44 343 1870 6 63 122 19 70 40 320 The average number of deaths from these diseases, during the last 10 years, was 345; so that the number for 1870 is 25 below the average. The number of deaths from all causes, in infants and children under 5 years of age, was 711; being less than in 1869, when the deaths were 717. The deaths occuring at and above 60 were 279, including 44 at and above 80. The numbers for the preceding year were 294 and 43. 312 deaths arose from pulmonary diseases; the number for the preceding year being 251. 19 The number of deaths which occurred in the Workhouse was 107-48 males, 59 females; the numbers for the preceding 10 years having been 137, 160, 172, 158, 167, 174, 156, 186, 178, and 140. 17 deaths took place in Corporation Buildings; the numbers for the preceding 3 years having been 14, 26, and 21 respectively. 27 deaths occurred in the House of Correction; the number for 1869 having been 28. I death occurred in the House of Detention. The accidental deaths were 16 ; the number for 1869 being 25— 8 of them arose from fractures and contusions; 1 from a burn; and 7 from suffocation in infants. 2 deaths of infants arose from murder. 2 deaths arose from suicide, against 9 in the preceding year, viz :— 1 from a wound; and 1 from poison. 91 inquests were held in the year, including the 27 upon deaths in the House of Correction; being a decrease of 25 from the number of the preceding year. The table appended to this Report, contains an enumeration of the deaths, according to diseases and ages, in further detail. Hence the deaths from all causes in the year were below the average, and below the number for the preceding year. The deaths from all zymofic diseases, as well as those from the principal of these diseases, have also suffered a diminution. The deaths from Small Pox have experienced an increase; in fact, towards the end of the year, the disease began to prevail epidemically, both in the Metropolis and in this Parish. To this I shall have to allude in my next Report. I believe that the Vaccination Inspector does his work well. The deaths from Scarlet Fever increased somewhat in the year. The method of preventing the spread and fatality of this disease was so fully stated in my last Report, that I need not repeat it here. The deaths from Hooping Cough suffered a considerable reduction. The deaths from Typhus were fewer than in any of the preceding 10 years. Slaughter-houses—These were inspected, as usual, prior to the licensing. They were 36: kept by the same number of butchers. Last year they were 38 in both respects. They were generally in good condition. Cow-houses—These were also visited by the Sanitary Committee and myself. They were 33, kept by 30 cow-keepers; the cows being 452. In 1869, the cow-houses were 32, cow-keepers 29, and the cows 326. The keeping of pigs found in one instance, was ordered to be discontinued. One Cow-yard, (Jelley's) in Upper Rosoman Street, a perpetual nuisance, was ordered to be re-paved, and the dung-pit improved, which was done. 20 Bake houses. These were also inspected in the spring, they were 64; mostly in good order—2 being however very dirty—the improvements ordered, were carried out. Artizans' Dwellings Act. Under this Act, I condemned a house, (No. 1 Easton Street), in which there was no dust.bin, the house refuse having to be deposited in the passage under the staircase, necessarily rendering the house offensive. The Vestry did not carry out my recommendation. [Evil since remedied.] The houses in the Turnmill Street Courts, which I condemned in the preceding year, and in my last Report stated "were in hand," must be considered "in hand" still, for nothing further has been done to them vet. Workshops Regulation Act. Several complaints made in regard to this Act, were attended to; and as reported in the previous year the warning of the employers was found sufficient. The Meteorology of the year was as follows :— Temperature, Average Difference from Average of 100 years. Dew.point. Humidity (Saturation = 100) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 54 years. Tear 48.7 —0.1 42.0 78 29.80 18.5 —7.0 Winter Quarter (Jan., Feb., Mar.) 38.0 —0.6 32.8 82 29.79 4.1 —1.0 Spring Quarter (April, May, June.) 54.4 +2.1 45.0 70 26.94 1.2 —4.6 Summer Quarter (July, Aug., Sept.) 60.7 +1.1 52.5 75 29.84 5.6 —1.8 Autumn Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 41.6 —2.1 37.9 87 29.64 7.6 +0.4 Hence the mean temperature of the year was slightly below the average: the spring and summer quarters being above; and the autumn and winter quarters below the average. The rain-fall during the year was extremely deficient; amounting to 18½ inches only, the average of the last 54 years being 25½ inches. This deficiency must exert considerable influence upon the sanitary 21 condition of a district; because the streets and sewers are not sufficiently washed to carry away infectious and decomposing matters. As the expression "inches of rain" may not be very clear, I may say. that, admitting 1/100 in. of rain to amount to 1 ton per acre, the streets and sewers of the Parish were washed by 266,000 tons less rain-water than usually occurs in the course of a year. Sanitary Improvements. The important drainage works effected during the year are enumerated in the appended Surveyor's Report. The no less important house-cleansings, supplies of carbolic acid, at the Vestry expense, and disinfections of rooms, &c., where zymotic disease has prevailed, of which we have received notice, have been very numerous; and although they are not enumerated, the Vestry will, I am sure, believe me when I say that they have been satisfactorily carried out. I have the honor to remain,. Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D. Member of the Royal College of Physicians. November, 1871. DEATHS REGISTERED IN CLERKENWELL, IN 1870.
