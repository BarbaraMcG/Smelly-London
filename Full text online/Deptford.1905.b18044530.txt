To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the vital statistics and sanitary work for the Registration Year 1905, 52 weeks ending December 30th, 1905. POPULATION. The population of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford is estimated at 114,512 at the middle of the year 1905. BIRTHS. The number of births registered during the year 1905 was 3,290, of which 1,681 were males and 1,609 females, equivalent to an annual rate of 28·73 per 1,000 of the population, exactly the same rate as the previous year. The birth-rate for England and Wales was 28·2, for the 75 great towns 27·2, for the 141 smaller towns 26·9, and that for the County of London 27·1 The subjoined table gives the number of births which occurred in each Ward, and the birth-rate in each Ward. (See also Tables 6, 7, 8 and 9):— Ward. Births. Birth Rate per 1,000. Males. Females. Total.

The illegitimate births numbered 71, of these 18 were registered from one house and 7 from another. In consequence of enquiries made it was ascertained that the mothers of 47 of these children were non-parishoners. MARRIAGES. The number of marriages registered in the Borough of Deptford during the year 1905 was 657, whilst that for the previous year was 704. The marriages for the past ten years were:— 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 588 687 709 735 666 746 713 629 704 657 DEATHS. The number of deaths registered during the year was 1,642 (males 824, females 818), of these 498 occurred in public institutions outside the district. There were 548 deaths belonging to the North District, 428 to the South District and 666 to the Central District. The subjoined table gives the number of deaths which occurred in each Ward, and the death-rate in each Ward. (See also tables 6, 7, 8 and 9):— E 2 3 Ward. Deaths. Death Rate per 1,000. Males. Females. Total. East Ward 223 200 423 18.83 North Ward 226 200 426 17.06 North West Ward 156 166 322 13.39 South Ward 59 85 144 11.64 South East Ward 82 92 174 14.31 South West Ward 78 75 153 10.61 (This death-rate is calculated on the census population of 1901.) Deaths of residents occurring in outlying public institutions are allotted to the respective wards according to the addresses of the deceased as received from the Registrar-General's Department. Table No. 11 gives a list of the institutions in which the deaths occurred. The total death-rate for the Borough was equal to annual rate of 14-33 per 1,000 persons living. The death-rate for England and Wales 15-2, for the 75 great towns 15-7, for the 141 smaller towns 14-4, and for the County of London 15T. MORTALITY AT GROUP OF AGES. The 1,642 deaths recorded during the year included 560 children under five years of age. The deaths of 411 children occurred under one year; 149 deaths were registered between one and five years; 69 between five and fifteen; 78 between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five; 525 of persons over 25 and under 65; and 410 of persons aged upwards of 65 years. INFANTILE MORTALITY. Infantile mortality, that is to say, the proportion of deaths of infants under one year to every 1,000 children born during the year was 124, the lowest yet recorded in the Borough. It is gratifying to know that the printed instructions upon the feeding and care of infants, which were first distributed in the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford as far back as the year 1901, are still eagerly asked for; and the mortality being so low proves that these instructions are now more carefully read and carried out. 4 The chief causes of death were Diarrhoea and Enteritis 80, Bronchitis 57, Pneumonia 33, Whooping Cough 10, Measles 5, Premature Birth 61, Accidents from Suffocation in bed (overlying), &c., 20. The infantile mortality for the past seven years was:— 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 196 159 150 138 136 149 124 The Table of infantile mortality No 5 shows the causes of death arranged in weeks and months under one year of age in the three districts—North, South, and Central (see also Table No. 6 for the Wards). SHEWING THE NUMBER OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS IN THE BOROUGH DURING THE YEAR 1905. BIRTHS 3290 DEATHS (including 498 in Outlying Public Institutions) 1642 Excess of Births over Deaths 1648 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The Registrar-General classifies under this heading—SmallPox, Scarlet Fever, Measles, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, "Fever" (Typhus, Enteric and Continued), Diarrhœa, and Plague. The number of deaths registered from Zymotic diseases amounted to 142, as compared with 264, 233, and 211 for the three preceding years. Diarrhœa was the cause of 84 deaths, as compared with 112 for the previous year. The average death-rate from Zymotic diseases was 1.24 per 1000 persons living, as compared with 2.32 for the previous year. The death-rate from this class of disease for England and Wales was 1.52, that for the 75 great provincial towns 1.96, for the 141 smaller provincial towns 1.50, and for the County of London 1.71. NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Under this heading are included Small-Pox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Erysipelas, Scarlet Fever, Typhus, Enteric, Relapsing or Continued Fever and Puerperal Fever [Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891]. 5 The number of notifications received during the year was 991, as compared with 1,129 and 1,184 for the two previous years. Table No. 3 shows the distribution of these cases in the North, South, and Central Districts of the Borough, and those sent to Hospital for treatment. SMALL- POX. Two notifications of small-pox were received during the year. One in May referred to a child, aged one year and seven months, who contracted the disease on board the S.S. "Cheshire" from Rangoon; the other referred to a young woman, aged 23 years, who was removed to Hospital but afterwards found not to be suffering from small-pox. In the previous year 11 cases occurred in the Borough. In the County of London 74 cases were notified during the year. SCARLET FEVER. The notifications of scarlet fever numbered 631, compared with 425, 638, and 550 in the three previous years. The 631 notifications related to 603 cases. Of these 594 were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals for treatment, 12 proved to be errors of diagnoses, leaving therefore 591 cases. The deaths were 9, and in the three preceding years 11, 18, and 17. The rate of mortality was 0.07 per 1,000 of the population. The rate of mortality for England and Wales was 0.11, for the 75 great provincial towns 0.13, for the 141 smaller provincial towns 0.11, and for the Metropolis as a whole 0.12. The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3, North Deptford 223, South Deptford 145, Central Deptford 235. DIPHTHERIA AND MEMBRANOUS CROUP. There were received 168 notifications representing 149 cases, compared with 190, 257 and 414 for the three preceding years; the number of cases removed to the hospital was 115, of these 18 were returned as errors of diagnosis, the deaths registered were 9, for the three previous years they were 16, 18 and 34 respectively. The death rate was 0.07 per 1,000 persons living. The rate of mortality for England and Wales was 0.16, for the 75 great provincial towns 0.18, for the 141 smaller provincial towns 0.15, and for the County of London 0.12. 6 The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3—North Deptford 32, South Deptford 53, Central Deptford 58. Bacteriological examinations were made by the Clinical Research Association of 71 specimens of membrane sent to them, with the result that 20 were positive and 51 negative. ENTERIC FEVER. The number of notifications received was 38 referring to 33 cases, compared with 29, 73 and 60 for the three previous years. Of these 25 were sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals for treatment, and 8 cases were returned as not suffering from Enteric Fever. The deaths during the year were 6, and those for the three preceeding years were 3, 11 and 10. The death rate was equivalent to an annual rate of 0.05 per 1,000 of the population. The rate of mortality for England and Wales was 0.09, that for the 75 great provincial towns 0 08, for the 141 smaller provincial towns 0.13, and for the Metropolis as a whole 0.05. The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3—North Deptford 10, South Deptford 14, Central Deptford 9. Bacteriological examinations were made by the Clinical Research Association of 17 specimens of blood sent to them, with the result that 6 were positive and 11 negative. ERYSIPELAS. Of this disease 152 certificates were received, whilst for the three preceding years the numbers Were 146,134 and 147 respectively. They were distributed as follows—North Deptford 50, South Deptford 42, Central Deptford 60. PUERPERAL FEVER. Seven cases of this disease were notified during the year, and 4 of these were removed to the Greenwich Union Infirmary for treatment; one proved fatal. The number of puerperal cases notified during the three preceding years was 8, 3 and 2 respectively. Of the seven cases reported 2 were in North Deptford, 1 in South Deptford and 4 in Central Deptford. In each case enquiries were made, and the nurses or midwives in attendance were warned not to attend any other confinement for a period of at least 14 days, and in each case the premises, the bedding, clothing, &c., of the patient were disinfected, as well as the clothing, &c., of the attendant, by the Council's staff. 7 DIARRHŒA. The total number of deaths from diarrhœa was 84, of these 82 were children under five years of age, including 66 under one year. They were distributed as follows North Deptford 37, South Deptford 5, Central Deptford 42. The death rates for the past five years are shown in the subjoined table:- 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 Deptford 0.94 0.67 0.64 0.98 0.73 London 0.86 0.53 0.64 1.02 0.73 The rate of mortality from this disease was 0-73, for England and Wales 0-59, for the 75 great towns 0-83, for the 141 smaller towns 0-57, and for the Metropolis 0-73. MEASLES. As measles is not a notifiable disease it is impossible to form a correct idea of the extent of an outbreak, except by means of the death returns and school certificates. On information of the existence of a case of measles in a house, the Inspector calls and leaves printed instructions as to the provisions of the "Order" relating to the exposure of infected persons, clothing, &c. with the parent or the person responsible for the care of the patient. He also sees the premises, clothing, *&c. are properly disinfected. Leaflets have been freely distributed as to the treatment and management of measles. Information was received during the year of 600 cases, and the number of deaths registered was 16, as compared with 72, 58, and 46 for the three previous years. Of the 16 deaths 14 were under five years of age, including 5 under one year. The mortality was equal to a rate of 0.13 per 1,000 persons living, that for England and Wales was 0.32, for the 75 great towns 0.40, for the 141 smaller towns 0.31, and for London as a whole 0.37. WHOOPING COUGH Caused 18 deaths; of these, 17 were children under five years of age, including 10 under one year. Ten were registered in the North Deptford District, 2 in the South Deptford District and 6 in the Central Deptford District. The deaths in the three preceding years were 49, 36 and 50. 8 The annual rate of mortality was 0.15 per 1,000 of the population, that for England and Wales 0.25, for 75 great towns 0.29, for the 141 smaller towns 0.23 and for London as a whole 0.32. TUBERCULOSIS. The number of deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Phthisis or consumption) and other tubercular diseases during the year was 182, compared with 220 for the previous year, being equal to a rate of 1.58 per 1,000 persons living. For the three preceding years the rate of mortality was 1.93, 1.81 and 1.58 respectively. Much has been said and written on the best measures to be adopted for the prevention and relief of Tuberculosis (Consumption). It has been suggested and in many districts carried out that voluntary notification to the sanitary authorities should be adopted, so that steps may be taken to ensure proper supervision and isolation where possible, but this does not seem to go far enough, and compulsory notification is suggested, and where carried out, as in Sheffield, has proved to be most successful. There were 64 deaths registered in the North Deptford District, 39 in the South Deptford District and 79 in the Central Deptford District. RESPIRATORY DISEASES. Under this heading are included Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy and other diseases of the respiratory organs. 329 deaths were registered as against 344 for the previous year. Of these, 142 were children under five years of age, including 93 under one year, and 80 were persons of the age of 65 and upwards. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Infectious Diseases.

Certificates have been forwarded to me by most of the school teachers in the district relating to children who have been excluded from school on account of non-notifiable infectious diseases existing in their homes, such as Measles, WhoopingCough, Mumps, &c. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The Council renewed the arrangement with the Clinical Research Association, of No. 1, Southwark-street, London Bridge, for making bacteriological examinations and reports upon doubtful cases of Diptheria and Enteric Fever. Every medical practitioner in the Borough has been supplied with necessary apparatus for sending specimens for examination. During the year ending December 30th, 1905, 88 examinations were made of blood and membrane for Enteric Fever and Diphtheria, with the result that 26 were positive and 62 negative:— Enteric Fever. Diphtheria. Positive 6 Positive 30 Negative 11 Negative 51 17 71 Total, 88. At a cost of £15 11s. 4d. DISINFECTION. Disinfection is carried out at the Council's yard by means of a steam apparatus (Washington-Lyons), in which all articles of clothing and bedding are disinfected. Such infected articles which would be destroyed by steam, as leather goods, boots, furs, books, etc., are disinfected by formic aldehyde, volotised in an alformant lamp in a specially constructed zinc-lined chamber. There are two vans employed, one for use in collecting infected articles, the other for returning them after disinfection is completed. With very few exceptions, all disinfection is carried out by the staff of the Council, and no charge is made, c 10 During the year 1,370 rooms were disinfected, and 8,580 articles were subjected to disinfection at the Council's yard. Very few complaints were received during the year as to damage done to bedding, &c.; every care is taken by the disinfectors. Most of the articles destroyed was by the desire of the owners. Disinfecting fluid is supplied by the staff gratis where required. Disinfection was carried out under the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, of one room with bedding and wearing apparel. Also under the Midwives Act, 1902, in four cases, and under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in 600 cases of measles. Table No. 12 gives detailed account of the work done during the year. During the hot weather all the courts and alleys were kept constantly flushed with disinfectants by the Surveyor's staff. THE SHELTER. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 60, Sub-Section 4, imposes on the Sanitary Authority the duty of making provision for the temporary housing of persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings, for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. The premises are situated in Watson Street. It is very satisfactory to report the premises were not required to be used during the year. CORONER'S COURT ANO MORTUARY. With reference to the erection of a Coroner's Court and Mortuary, matters have so far advanced that the Council has signed the contract for the purchase of the land and issued advertisements for designs. INQUESTS. The number of inquests held on inhabitants of Deptford during the year was 133, of which 52 were held in the borough, the remaining 81 being on residents of Deptford who died in public institutions outside the borough. The following table gives the result of the inquests held during the year:— Natural Causes 64 Accidents 48 Suffocation 12 Suicides 5 Murder 4 Total 133 11 During the year 85 bodies were received into the Mortuary.

The Inspectors, acting under instructions, made frequent examinations of articles of food submitted for sale, and special visits were frequently made on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings to 13 those parts of the borough where food is sold at a cheap rate, and in consequence of these inspections the following articles were removed and destroyed under Sec. 47, Sub-sec. 8 Public Health (London) Act, 1891, at the request of the persons exposing them or having them for sale:— 2 barrels of Apples. 1 box of smoked Haddocks. 3 boxes of Haddocks. 1 box of Hake. 126 Rabbits. 2 boxes of Mackerel. 4 boxes of Plaice. 150 baskets of Cherries. 1 carcase of Pig. 11 lbs. of Plums. 1 box of Haddock's Roes. 2 boxes of Cod. 1 box of Codling. REVENUE ACT, 1903. The only application made under this Act during the year was with respect to Evelyn Buildings, New Cross Road, comprising 15 tenements, and certificates were granted after inspection.

The Common Lodging houses are under the control of the London County Council, but are visited from time to time by the officers of the Sanitary Authority in connection with drainage defects, cases of infectious disease, &c. By the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, the County Council has become a licensing authority for the common lodging houses within the County. Licences may be granted or refused annually. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. The following is a list of the common lodging houses registered in the district, providing accommodation for 552 persons:— Reg.

The Council appointed Inspector Wright in March, 1904, to carry out the duties of house to house inspection throughout the whole Borough. These duties were carefully carried out, with the result that many sanitary defects were discovered, and which were afterwards remedied. Inspector Wright, however, resigned in September of last year, and no one has yet been appointed in his place. The subjoined table gives the result of such inspection.

During the year a systematic inspection was made of all the stables in the Borough. The total number of stables was 205. Special attention was given to the defects discovered. They consisted chiefly of defective paving of stable or yard, defective drainage, gutters, absence of or defective manure receptacles, and other minor defects, all of which were subsequently remedied. URINALS. Constant supervision has been kept on all the urinals in the Borough, with the result that nuisances frequently arising from these places have been considerably abated. OFFENSIVE SMELLS. The London County Council's attention was called to a nuisance caused by offensive smells emanating from their surface ventilator in Canterbury Road. This has now been abated by the erection of a ventilating shaft. WATER SUPPLY CERTIFICATES. The number of water supply certificates granted during the year in accordance with Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 120. THE CRECHE. The Creche has been established at 34 Albury Street for the last thirteen or fourteen years, and has done good work in the Borough. It deserves to be better supported. It is maintained chiefly by voluntary contributions. The charge made for each child is 3d. for the whole day or l½d. for half day. The ages at 17 which they are received varies from a fortnight to three years. The parents of the children must be respectable, and produce a reference from a householder or a minister. The average number received per day is 17. The staff consists of a matron and two nurses. HOUSE PROPERTY INSPECTIONS, &c. A summary of the sanitary work done during the year will be found in Table No. 18. The total number of premises inspected was 3,924, whilst reinspections, calls, services of notices, &c., amounted to 15,961. The number of preliminary notices or "Intimations" served during the year was 1,504, whilst the number of "Statutory Notices" served was but 38, and in only 22 cases was it necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce these orders. Overcrowding was abated in 30 cases without having to take legal proceedings. Smoke Nuisances. During the year 106 observations were made of chimneys emitting black smoke, and in 43 cases where black smoke was emitted in such quantity as to be a nuisance, notices were served to abate the nuisance. Legal proceedings were taken against the South London Cleaning Company, 41, Rollins Street, and fines amounting to £4 and 6s. costs were obtained, and against the Mazawattee Tea Company, Ltd., Cold Blow Lane, and fines amounting to 15s. and 6s. costs were obtained. PLACES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. The premises inspected under this head include hotel kitchens, restaurants, ham and beef shops, eel pie shops, fried fish shops, eating houses of all kinds, and all places where food is prepared for sale. There are at present on the register 99 premises of various kinds, including 124 rooms. Seventy-three inspections have been made during the year, and where found necessary, the premises have been cleansed and limewashed, and any defects discovered have been remedied. Constant inspection and attention has resulted in the premises being kept in a satisfactory condition. BAKEHOUSES. The number of bakehouses on the register at the close of the year was 78. Of these 76 are workshops and 2 are factories. One bakehouse has been closed during the year, and the premises converted to other uses. 18 Two hundred and forty-five inspections have been made during the year. No underground premises have closed during the year, the number of same remaining at 28. The bakehouses have been periodically inspected, and the cleansing and lime-washing regularly carried out. I am pleased to again report that the bakehouses of the Borough are in a satisfactory condition. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The premises have been periodically inspected during the year, and the necessary measures taken to enforce the regulations under the control of the Borough Council, viz., the provision of sanitary accommodation for the use of workpeople of both sexes, cleansing and ventilation, and the reception and issuing of lists of outworkers, with the registration and inspection of outworkers' premises. On inspection, it is found necessary to cancel the names of many on the outworkers' register, owing to removal and change of address. The class of people so employed are constantly on the move. The number so dealt with during the year was 84. Where found necessary on inspection the premises have been cleansed and limewashed and any other defects remedied. Proceedings were instituted in three cases for neglecting to furnish the lists of outworkers, as required by Section 107 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, and the full penalty of £2 and costs was imposed in each case. In two cases work was found on outworkers' premises in which infectious sickness was notified, and the same was removed and disinfected before being returned to the employers. The number of workshops on the register at the close of the year, including bakehouses and laundries, was 269. The number of inspections for the year was 432. The number of inspections on factory premises was 33. The number of outworkers' premises on the register was 449; and the number of inspections 279. Workplaces other than the above were:—On the register, 98; number of inspections, 73. (For details sec Tables Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17). 19 DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS, AND PURVEYORS OF MILK. These premises have been kept under constant supervision, and the cleanly condition of vessels and premises has been enforced. The number at present on the register as "purveyors of milk" is 193. The number of inspections for the year was 469. Where found necessary cleansing and lime-washing has been carried out, and any corroded measures or vessels found in use were prohibited. It is found that constant inspection is required to enforce due compliance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders, more especially in the smaller shops, and in lower class districts. Infectious Cases.—The following cases of infectious sickness have occurred in connection with milkshop premises:— Scarlet Fever 8 Diphtheria 1 Erysipelas 1 Measles 4 Chicken Pox 1 15 cases. In each case the necessary measures were taken in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders. Proceedings were taken in one case against a person for contravening the Orders by continuing the sale of milk on infected premises without the said premises having been disinfected, and so declared by the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health, and a fine of £5 and costs was imposed. ICE CREAM. The inspection of these premises has been continued, and where found necessary, cleansing and repairs carried out. Street barrows have also been kept under observation. The number of premises on the register at the close of the year was 99. Number of inspections 189. The business is generally carried on during the summer months ; very little being done during the winter season. In consequence of regular supervision and inspection, the premises are kept in a more cleanly condition than formerly. Proceedings were taken in four cases, viz.:— (a) Manufacturing of ice cream in living room—Fined 20s. and costs. 20 Also storing of ice cream in such a way as to cause contamination—Fined £2 and costs. (b) Omitting to give notice of infectious sickness on the premises—Fined £2 and costs. (c) Neglecting to have name and address on barrow in use— Fined 10s. and costs. (d) Neglecting to have name and address on barrow in use— Fined 5s. and costs. COW SHEDS. The following are the Cow sheds in the borough, at present licensed by the London County Council:— Charman, Thomas, 14, Vulcan Road 1 cow Crutcher, George, 117, Pomeroy Street 12 cows Glover, George, 49, Watson Street 4 „ Weston, John, 178-182, Grove Street (rear) 14 „ Weston, J. & Sons, 33, Octavius Street 25 „ Do. 211, Railway Arches.

Number of Slaughter Houses in the Borough 6 ,, Inspections 50 All licences were renewed at the last licensing session of the London County Council. 21 OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. There are five premises in the Borough carrying on offensive businesses under the offensive trade regulations of the London County Council. 103 inspections have been made during the year, and the regulations duly enforced, and the periodical cleansing and limewashing carried out in accordance with the bylaws. Complaints of nuisance from a bone-boiling works were received from occupiers of the houses adjoining the works, and a house-tohouse canvas was made of the houses in the immediate neighbourhood, to ascertain the opinions of the inhabitants, and on report to the Public Health Committee, the matter was referred to the Council's solicitor. A reference having been received from the London County Council, reporting a breach of regulations, in two instances, two summonses were issued against the occupiers of the works referred to, and a fine of £5 and £3 3s. costs was imposed on each summons. REGISTRATION OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS. The resolution of the Council, passed November 22nd, 1904, with reference to the suggested transfer of registration of births and deaths, duties at present carried out by Boards of Guardians, might be transferred to the Borough Councils with advantage to the public, and the registrations effected at the Town Hall or municipal buildings instead of at the private residences of the Registrars, during limited hours. The suggestion was sent to all the Metropolitan Boroughs and cities of London and Westminster, inviting an expression of opinion as to the desirability or otherwise of the proposal. Replies have been received from all the boroughs and cities of London and Westminster, and they are for the most part in favour of the Council's proposal. The Finsbury Borough Council approves of the proposal and is of opinion that the administration of the Vaccination Acts might with advantage be also transferred to the Borough Councils, and has so informed the other Metropolitan Borough Councils. The cities of London and Westminster are also of this opinion. The Royal Borough of Kensington further suggests that the duties of the Guardians as regards registration of marriages might also be transferred to the Councils. Fulham Borough Council suggests that the London County Council should be asked to deal with the matter in their next General Powers Bill. 22 The chief reasons for desiring the change are: — 1st. There would be no delay in obtaining the necessary information which is indispensable to the Public Health Authorities. 2nd. The Town Hall would be a more fitting place than a private house for registration. 3rd. The hours available to the public would not be so limited. PHYSICAL DETERIORATION AND DRUNKENNESS. In accordance with the report of the Commission on Physical Deterioration, placards were published and placed in the most conspicuous places in the Borough, calling the attention of the public to the dangers of excessive alcoholism and thereby physical deterioration. Subjoined is a copy. Borough of Deptford. Physical Deterioration and Drunkenness. The report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Physical Deterioration presented to Parliament by command of His Majesty, states that the abuse of alcohol is a most potent and deadly agent of physical deterioration. In pursuance of this report, and in the interests of the public health, the following incontrovertible facts are published. Drunkenness, or the excessive use of alcohol, produces the most various and fatal diseases. Lunacy figures from asylums show admissions due to this cause alone varying from 13 to 30 per cent. Drunkenness, or the excessive use of alcohol, predisposes to consumption. It is especially liable to cause diseases of the stomach, liver, and nervous system. It complicates and aggravates all acute diseases, such as typhoid, pneumonia, and erysipelas, which are much more dangerous in heavy drinkers than in others. Its hereditary influence is very powerful for evil. It leads to the ruin of families, the neglect of social duties, disgust for work, misery, and crime. Drunkenness, or the excessive use of alcohol, is therefore a most terrible enemy to personal health, social well-being, and national efficiency. By order of the Council, H. W. Roberts, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Deptford, November, 1905. 23 CANAL BOATS. Annual Report for the Year 1905. Gentlemen, January 4th, 1906. I have the honour to present the following report under the Canal Boats Acts for the year ending December 31st, 1905:— During the year 45 visits for the purposes of inspection have been made on the following dates, viz.:—January 20th; February 3rd, 10th and 24th; March 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, 28th and 31st; April 6th, 7th, 13th, 19th and 98th; May 5th, 12th, 19th and 26th; June 2nd, 8th, 9th, 14th, 16th and 23rd; July 7th, 14th and 28th; August 12th and 19th; September 1st and 29th; October 3rd, 7th, 13th and 20th; November 3rd, 14th, 24th and 29th; December 2nd, 9th, 15th, 22nd and 29th. Boats were inspected on 13 occasions, as follows, viz.:- On February 3rd, March 28th, April 6th and 7th, June 8th and 14th, August 12th (3 boats), September 1st, October 3rd, November 14th and 29th, December 9th and 29th (3 boats). Number of Visits 45 ,, Boats Inspected 17 No infringements of regulations have been found on the boats during the year. Boat "Leslie," No. 229, registered at Brierley Hill, under notice to repair on December 28th, 1904, was duly repaired and certified by the Inspector of the Registration Authority. No cases of sickness have been found on board the boats during the year. I have again pleasure in directing attention to the general cleanliness of the boats inspected. I find them very well found and kept. There are still very few boats in use on the canal within the borough. The borough is not a registration authority. The arrangements made for the Inspection of Boats are:— Periodical inspection by Sanitary Inspector duly appointed an Inspector under the Canal Boats Acts, jointly with other duties as Inspector of Workshops, Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops, &c., &c. 24 Name and Address of Inspector:- Thomas Turner, 161, St. Asaph Road, Brockley, S.E. Remuneration of Inspector:- £2 per annum (part of salary as a Sanitary Inspector) apportioned to these duties. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Thomas Turner, Canal Boat Inspector. I desire to express my high appreciation of the manner in which my Inspectors have performed their onerous duties. They have at all times displayed energy, zeal, and above all, tact, which has, in many instances, obviated the necessity of taking legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the notices of the Council. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Henry William Roberts, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX. 26 Table No. 1. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF DEPTFORD.
