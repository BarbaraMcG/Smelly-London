Mr Mayor Ladies and Gentlemen I have the honour to present the 34th Annual Report on the health of the people of Brentford and Chiswick The year 1961 was statistically not an entirely satisfactory one for the general health of the citizens There was a rise in the death rate, arise in the birth rate combined with a rise in the infant mortality rate the number of infants born prematurely re mained for the second successive year two and a half times as large as in 1950 The number of illegitimate births was nearly twice that of ten years ago Nevertheless in a year of bad weather with limited sunshine during the summer months infectious disease did not present great problems although there was a good deal of influenza and a considerable amount of mild measles One case of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred diphtheria was absent and scarlet fever and dysentery cases were few in number Notifications of tuberculosis were fewer and for the second year in succession only one death from this disease was recorded The low incidence of food poisoning is good a reward for the increasing care which is taken in the supervision both of the food to be eaten and the methods of handling displaying and distributing it Comfort and assistance for the elderly the handicapped and the chronic sick increases year by year and co operation between the Department and the voluntary and other local authority bodies functioning in these matters is excellent The kindness and goodwill of the general public towards the less fortunate members of the community is shown by the amount of time spent and money gathered and distributed by the voluntary organisations of the Borough many of whom have short summaries of their work included in this Report Work on the reduction of Atmospheric Pollution continued throughout the year the second Smoke Control Order was confirmed and the survey on the third was well advanced before the end of 1961 A year of preventive medicine can be considered successfully completed when there has been no drama no need for spectacular action and an increase in the health happiness, and pursuit of knowledge amongst the citizens 1961 was such a year in which there were no great epidemics to lower resistance to disease later and fill the hospital beds more facilities for and use of means of public entertainment and recreation greater provision of and demand for, educational and library amenities so that in spite of the vital statistics, it seems reasonable to hope for long term benefits from an uneventful year I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for the courtesy and support extended to me throughout the year, and my grateful thanks go out also to Dr. Pine, to the Chief Public Health Inspector and to all the Departmental staff for their unfailing loyalty and assistance.

The south of the Borough is bounded by the River Thames and in Brentford, the river is joined by the southern outlet of the Grand Union Canal which flows through Brentford from North to South and carries a considerable weight of goods traffic There are 625 5 acres of open space within the borough with ample facilities for refreshment and recreation both for the public in general and for the sport ing activities of particular groups The proportion of open space to the total area of the Borough is approximately 25%, a very reasonable proportion for an urban area The residents of the Borough are of mixed categories including professional and clerical people of all grades artisans, factory workers etc. and the types of dwellings vary from flatted houses and cottages to large detached residences in their own surrounding grounds The amount of slum property is not consider able and progress continues to be made with the demolition of houses which are no longer fit for human habitation Information on the rehousing of the tenants 9 in council houses and details concerning assessment of slum dwellings, demoli tion and the building of new houses are supplied later in this Report. Overcrowding of dwelling houses still remains a problem in the Borough but the number of cases of statutory overcrowding known to the Public Health Depart ment at the end of the year decreased. There were fewer new cases found during the year and again there was an increase in the number of cases relieved during the year. In this year also the Housing Committee of the Council reviewed the points system by which housing needs of applicants are assessed, in order to give advancement in priority to applicants with serious health difficulties, and to endeavour to provide ground floor accommodation or in flats with lift service for the old and the severely handicapped whenever they could be housed. The unemployment figures for adult persons i.e. aged 18 and over in the Borough at the end of 1961, reflect a decrease in the number of jobs available due to various firms moving out of the Borough to larger premises On the 11th December, 1961, there were 266 unemployed altogether of which 200 were men and 66 women. This compares with 147 men and 34 women unemployed at the end of 1960, and 180 men and 55 women unemployed at the end of 1959. On 6th December 1961 the number of jobs vacant totalled 331,, (423 at the same date in 1960) of which 133 were for men and 198 for women i,e. there were more vacancies than there were unemployed persons seeking vacancies. The unemployment figures at the end of 1961 of young persons under 18 years of age were as follows:- Boys Girls Total Number of young persons (other than school leavers) registered as unemployed on 31.12.61 6 5 11 Boys and Girls who left school at Christmas to enter employment 81 71 152 Totals 87 76 163 Vacancies outstanding at 31.12.61 89 141 230 Contrary to general belief earlier in the year that there would be a shortage of progressive vacancies in the area to meet the anticipated increase in the number of school leavers the demand from employers for most categories of young workers was heavy throughout the year and it was found that the first year of the bulge' did not result in boys and girls experiencing undue difficulties in finding suitable employment This was due mainly to many boys and girls deciding to return to school for a fifth year and therefore reducing the number of leavers at the end of the Summer term below the level expected although there is no question that there was in addition an improvement in the general industrial situation compared with last year. It was not always possible to meet the labour requirements of employers but many factors outside the control of the Youth Employment Service contributed to this difficulty. 10- Parks and Open Spaces controlled by the Council Area in Acres Boston Manor Park and Island 40.7 Carville Hall Park South 4.7 Carville Hall Park North 9.1 St Paul's Recreation Ground 4.3 The Ham Recreation Ground 1.3 Chiswick Common South 8.7 Chiswick House 66.8 Stamford Brook Common 2.1 Homefields Recreation Ground 10.3 Strand Open Space 2.6 Turnham Green Common 7.5 Duke's Meadows Sports Ground 25.7 Embankment Promenade 9.1 Future Embankment Promenade 15.3 Chiswick Open Air Pools Site 1.2 10.4 acres of the above open space land are used as allotments.

Total number of persons using baths in 1961 44,126 Average number per day 138 Maximum number using baths on one day 514 Chiswick Open Air Swimming Pools Large Pool Area 7,500 sq.ft. Capacity 33,750 c. ft. Small Pool Area 3,500 sq.ft. Capacity 18,375 c.ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1961 91,890 Average number per day 647 Maximum number using baths on one day 4,966 The source of the water in the swimming baths is the mains supply of the Metropolitan Water Board In both the indoor bath and the outdoor pools the water goes through a continuous filtration process, the rate of change over being about once every three hours in the indoor bath and about once every ten hours in the open air pools, though this latter rate is speeded up during periods of heavy use of the pools. Topping up to allow for loss by evaporation or removal is done several times weekly Additional purification is carried out by means of intermittent chlorination, the amount of free chloride aimed at being 0.6 parts per million. Water samples are taken two to three times daily throughout the season for the purposes of chemical analysis and pH estimation. An enquiry was made into the efficacy of the drug Panacide as a disinfectant in the open air swimming pool because of its alleged efficiency in keeping the water free from algal deposits In was decided that a trial could be made of this treatment provided there was strict control of the amount used, The bactericidal effect was not 100% as from one sample of bath water taken faecal coli were returned, the subsequent sampling being satisfactory, Monthly sampling of water from all the pools was carried out and on one occasion faecal coli were obtained in the closed bath at Brentford This was quickly rectified. Paddling Pools Duke's Meadows:- Area (2 pools each 60' x 60')., 7,200 sq.ft. Depth 6 to 1 in middle These paddling pools are emptied and refilled daily from the mains supply and ½ pint of Chloros is added at each filling. They are open from approximately 1st April to 30th September each year, according to weather conditions. Public Baths and Washhouses Brentford In Clifden Road Brentford, the Council maintains premises containing 21 slipper baths, 14 for men and 7 for women The total number using the baths during 1961 was 20,087 persons. -12- Chiswick In Belmont Road, Chiswick the Council maintains premises containing 31 slipper baths, 22 for men, and 9 for women In addition, 2 hip baths are available particularly for the use of elderly persons. The total number using the baths during 1961 was 41,376. In these premises are also 30 washing compartments comprising 30 coppers, a rinsing section, 30 drying horses, hot air drying compartments and 2 mangling machines. Ratepayers are entitled to use these washing facilities at a small charge of 6d per hour, and during 1961, 1,373 persons took advantage of the service. -13- Live Births VITAL STATISTICS, 1961 Total Male Female Legitimate 870 466 404 Birth Rate per 1,000 of 111egitim ate 90 45 45 tire estimated resident TO TAL 960 511 449 population 17.46 Sti11 births Total Male Femal e Legitimate 15 11 4 Rate per 1,000 total Illegitimate 2 1 1 (live and still) Births TOTAL 17 12 5 - 17 40 Deaths Total Male Female 6 10 308 302 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 1109 Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis - Rate per 1,000 total Other Puerperal Causes - (live and still) Births - Nil Deaths of Infants under 1 year of Age Total Male Female Legitimate 20 11 9 Rate per 1,000 live Illegitimate 1 - 1 Births -21- 88 TOTAL 21 11 10 -14- Deaths and Death Rate There was a rise in the death rate the figure of 11.09 comparing with one of 10.43 for the previous year. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age dis tribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar General In 1961. this factor was 0 96 and so the corrected death rate was 10.65. The corrected rate for Middlesex County was 11.6, and the rate for England and Wales was 12.0 so the figure for Brentford and Chiswick was well below both the County and the National rates. Table I gives a list of Causes of Death as classified according to the International system agreed by the World Health Organisation and in operation since November, 1949. The principal causes of death were 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 Circulatory Disease (inc luding coronary disease) 218 215 201 222 215 224 206 Heart Disease 73 84 76 99 82 91 96 Cancer (including Leukaemia) 134 126 123 130 135 153 139 Coronary disease was the highest individual cause of death in 1961 122 deaths were attributed to this disease 72 male and 50 female The number of deaths from cancer increased but male deaths from lung cancer were one less than in 1960 and there were no deaths from leukaemia. In Chiswick fifty years ago in 1911 one hundred and forty three persons died age 60+ including twenty-five of age 70+, fourteen aged 80+, and three aged 90+,The death rate in Chiswick for age 60+ was therefore 3.7 per 1,000 of the estimated resident population Figures for Brentford are not available In 1961 in Brentford and Chiswick the corresponding figures were as follows 465 died age 60: including 184 aged 70+, 130 aged 80- and 30 aged 90+ giving a death rate for over age 60 of 8 5 Of total deaths In 1911 (70 1% were of persons below 60 years of age Chiswick only (29 9% " " " over 60 years of age In 1961 (23 8% 11 " " below 60 years of age Brentford and (76 2% " " 11 over 60 years of age Chiswick So in at least part of the Borough the percentages of persons dying under age 60 is now less than half of the corresponding percentage fifty years ago. -15- The distribution of cancer deaths in sites and ages is shown below.

The ages of these cases were Males: 79, 56, 52, 40, 25,21 Females: 62, 21 Pour of these died as a result of accidents within the Borough three pedestrians (aged 79, 62 and 40) and a motor cyclist (aged 25). In all 15 persons including residents of other places, died as a result of road accidents occurring in Brentford and Chiswick 4 motor cyclists, 1 motor car passenger, 1 driver of an articulated lorry, 1 driver of an invalid carriage, 1 pedal cyclist and 7 pedestrians.None of these were children. Birth Rate During 1961 the number of live births recorded was 960,870 legitimate and 90 illegitimate0 There were 17 still-births, 12 male and 5 female. The Birth Rate rose from 15 75 in 1960 to 17 46 in 1961 To make an approx imate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar General This then gives a comparative birth rate of 16 76 compared with 17.4 for England and Wales as a whole The national birth rate was the highest since the year 1948. -17- INFANT MORTALITY There were 21 deaths of infants under 1 year of age (as compared with 10 in 1960), giving an infant mortality rate of 21.88 for 1961.The local figure compares with an infant mortality rate of 21.4 for England and Wales, which is the lowest national infant mortality rate ever recorded. The graph on page 19 shows the progress of Infant Mortality since the beginning of the century. The number of premature infants born in 1961 was 78 (74 in 1960) including 10 premature stillbirths. Of the 68 premature infants born alive, 3 were born at home and all survived to the end of one month, 65 were born in hospital, of whom 54 survived to the end of one monthu The percentage of premature infants to total births (live and still) is 8.0. The following figures show the percentages of premature infants to total births (live and still) since 1950, 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 3,3 4,5 5 6 4.9 6.0 6.9 6,4 8.4 7.3 6.6 8.1 8 0 Causes of infant deaths are shown in Table II on page 70. MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY Deaths from Puerperal Causes:- Puerperal Sepsis Nil Other Causes Nil During the year, 66 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified as compared with 67 in I960. Two cases occurred after home confinement, 64 were notified from Chiswick Maternity Hospital. 13 of the cases were residents of the Borougho The definition of puerperal pyrexia for notification purposes is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100. 4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after child-birth or miscarriage". -18- GRAPH " A " GRAPH SHOWING INFANTILE MORTALITY RATES DURING THE PERIOD 1900 - 1961 DEATHS PER 1000 BIRTHS - 19- PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES CONTROL OF VERMIN AND SCABIES By the courtesy of the School Medical Officer particulars regarding the cleanliness surveys in schools have been obtained, and are as follows Number of children examined Primary Schools 8,193 Secondary Modern Schools 4,822 13, 015 Number of children requiring treatment 73 Number of children in respect of whom cleansing notices were issued 61 Number of children cleansed by Local Health Authority 33 The figures for infestation with vermin improved during 1961., By arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health of Hammersmith, persons requiring cleansing because of infestation with scabies or vermin, can be treated at the Hammersmith Cleansing Station, During 1961, 8 persons were referred for cleansing, 5 for scabies, and 3 for lice. INFECTIOUS DISEASE In the year 1961 there was a rise in the incidence of infectious disease. This rise however was entirely due to an outbreak of measles, the outbreak being of rather a new character as it was not rapid in its development but continued throughout many months. Apart from measles 1961 was a very good year, dysentery and whooping cough which both showed high figures in 1960 dropped considerably and the figure for scarlet fever dropped for the second successive year. Measles The following figures of measles notifications show the fluctuations of this disease during the past ten years. 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1951 413 810 47 659 107 773 330 328 47 542 Measles notifications during 1961, as received each month were as follows: January February March April May June July August September 15 62 106 168 91 60 19 20 1 There were no measles notifications in the final three months of the year. Poliomyelitis One notification of paralytic poliomyelitis was received during the year -20- The patient was a boy of 14 years of age-he was very ill and developed paralysis of both legs and the left arm, with some weakness of the respiratory muscles and of the muscles of the spine At the end of the year he had improved considerably and was ready for transfer to the Orthopaedic Unit for rehabilitation The Scheme for inoculation against poliomyelitis inaugurated by Middlesex County Health Department in 1956. continued during 1961 Details of the year5 s work are as follows No of persons who received two injections during the year Children born Persons born Persons born before Dates of birth Total 1943 - 1960 1933 - 1942 1933 who have not unknown passed their 40th birthday 1,110 419 711 123 2S 363 Details are given below of persons who received a third injection during 1961c They have already been recorded as having two injections Children born Persons born Persons born before Dates of birth Total 1943 - 1960 1933-1942 1933 who have not unknown passed their 40th birthday 511 239 516 57 1,323 2,268 primary school children received a fourth injection during the year& Puerperal Pyrexia The number of notifications of puerperal pyrexia was 66 in 1961 compared with 67 in I960, There was no severe infection, these puerperal pyrexia cases were mild and mostly notified under the statutory requirement to notify any temperature rise to over 100° after confinement in the immediate post natal periodo. Smallpox In the last days of December three cases of smallpox were brought into this country by air from Karachi and observation of a contact within the Borough had commenced i.e. the contact was vaccinated and daily surveillance for the period of incubation instituted. Vaccina11 on against Smallpox The following information regarding vaccination against smallpox carried out in the Borough during 1961 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer,, Number of persons who Age Groups Total during the year were Under 1 1 2-4 5-14 15 & over vaccinated for first time 417 62 22 59 24 584 re-vaccinated - - 2 4 66 72 Total 417 62 24 63 90 656 21 Total number of first vaccinations- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 298 373 548 487 438 418 430 531 525 455 584 The figure for first vaccinations shows a rise, the first for some years, but still far short of the desirable number if it is compared with the number of infants born in the Borough. Vaccination of persons intending to travel abroad has to be confirmed by the vaccinating doctor on an International Certificate of Vaccination which is not acceptable unless the signature is authenticated by the Medical Officer of Healths During 1961, 439 such Certificates were authenticated. Scarlet Fever There was again a fall in the number of cases of scarlet fever notified and confirmed as such, the figure being 23 in 1961 compared with 39 in 1960 and 91 in 1959. 11 of these cases were admitted to hospital. Diphtheria No case of diphtheria occurred during the year The last confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough occurred in 1948, Information concerning immunisation against diphtheria in the Borough during 1961 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer, and is as follows:- Number of children who Age Total Under 1 1 2 4 5 - 14 completed a full course of primary immunisat ion 290 331 69 133 823 received reinforcing injections - 185 71 630 886 There was again a substantial increase in the number of children receiving protection against diphtheria, and it was very satisfactory to see that a considerable, though by no means sufficient, number of school children had attended a clinic or general practitioner to receive a reinforcement of their immunity acquired during infancy. Whooping Cough Two cases of whooping cough occurred in 1961. Immunisation against whooping cough is fairly general now, the inoculation being carried out either simultane ously with that for immunisation against diphtheria, or in series alternating with anti-diphtheria inoculation and outbreaks of whooping cough have not been occurring during the past few years. No deaths occurred from this disease during 1961. Food Poisoning Eight notifications of food poisoning were received during the year. Of these, 5 cases were subsequently not confirmed as food poisoning Of the 22 maining three cases one was established as food poisoning due to the organism Salmonella Typhi murium and the other two cases, although not pathogenically confirmed appeared to have followed the eating of oysters and therefore, were technically true cases of food poisoning. Dysentery Three notifications of dysentery were received One of these was not con firmed, the other two were confirmed as having been caused by Shigella Sonnei No contacts were affected. Influenza Influenza assumed near epidemic form in the early months of 1961 The infection was a relatively mild one without many fatalities but it was wide spread and caused a good deal of sickness absence, also it caused the hospitals to be overloaded and on an emergency admission basis for most of January, February and March, Three deaths were attributed to influenza. Typhoid and Paratyphoid There was one case of paratyphoid fever during 1961 The case was an adult female recently returned from a holiday in Sicily She was treated in hospital All house contacts were investigated but no other infected person was founds and there was no subsequent spread of infection. Tuberculosis The number of notifications of tuberculosis in 1961 was 47 as compared with 60 in the previous year the pulmonary cases amounting to 44 and the non pulmonary to 3.The number of deaths from this disease was one as compared with one in 1960 two in 1959 seven in 1958 four in 1957 six in 1956 and seven in 1955. The figure of 47 notifications includes 15 inward transfers i e cases notified because they had removed into the Borough but who had previously contracted the disease elsewhere. This leaves a total of 32 new cases of tuberculosis occurring within the borough compared with the figure of 33 new cases in 1960. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis as well as prevention and after care are provided by the Hounslow Chest Clinic, and home visiting is carried out by Health Visitors attached to this Clinic They are also responsible for the examination of contacts and for the B.C.G. inoculation for the prevention of tuberculosis. B.C.G. inoculation is now offered to all the Mantoux negative, i.e. susceptible contacts of newly discovered tuberculosis cases 84 such persons residing in this Borough were inoculated during 1961, plus two students from Brentford Hospital and 23 women from St Raphael" s Home, Brentford A prominent part in the treatment is played by domiciliary chemo-therapy (i.e. treatment with suitable drugs or injections given at home) on the recommendation of the Chest Physician with the aid of the Home Nurses (formerly District Nurses) provided by the Middlesex County Council. Apart from institutional treatment provided by the local Hospital Management Committees of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in General Hospitals and in Chest Hospitals. there is also a Middlesex County Council Hostel for chronic ambulant male tuberculous patients. -23- Facilities for convalescence, rehabilitation and training are provided by the Middlesex County Council and the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board The social side of the treatment and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis is dealth with by the Welfare Department of the Hounslow Chest Clinic. B.C.G. Vaccination As a result of the findings from the Tuberculosis Vaccinations Clinical Trial, which took place from 1950 to 1960, that a degree of protection could be afforded by the vaccination of school children with B.C. G. , a scheme was inaugurated in the County of Middlesex for the tuberculin testing and, if necessary, vaccination of school children at the age of 13. During 1961, 1,053 children were invited to take part in the scheme, 819 consents were received. These children were tuberculin tested, and those found to be positive, indicating a previous infection with tuberculosis of aminor or major degree at some period in their lives, were referred to the Chest Clinic for thorough investigation, 184 positives were so referred B C Gc vaccination was carried out on 528 children, 7 contacts of cases of tuberculosis were referred to the Chest Clinic. All tests and vaccinations during 1961 under this scheme were carried out by Middlesex County Council staff HOUSING CONDITIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1961 The housing conditions of 33 of the 47 cases of tuberculosis were found to be as follows - 32 patients lived in sufficiently satisfactory housing accommodation, 14 in flats, 8 in houses, 10 in lodgings or furnished rooms. One of the patients lived in overcrowded conditions. Three of them, including the one in overcrowded conditions lived in old dilapidated property, subject to dampness The housing particulars of 14 cases were not obtainable either because of removal of patients to other districts or because of resistance of patients to home visiting Eight new notifications came from homes already returning one or more cases of tuberculosis, 15 cases were inward transfers from other districts and, therefore, had not developed their illness while resident in Brentford and Chiswick. Of the four families previously reported in 1960 as living in old property, subject to dampness one had conditions improved by the carrying out of certain repairs under notice from the Public Health Department. Mass X ray During 1961, the mobile Mass X-ray unit made short visits to two factories in the Borough 931 people were X rayed and one case of active tuberculosis was discovered. In addition two factories which are being visited regularly, under a scheme of research into the occurrence of tuberculosis in factory employees aged over 40, were visited twice One case of active tuberculosis was found and one observation case. -24- It is now possible to send persons desirous of availing themselves of the facility, to a static Mass X ray Unit at West Middlesex Hospital without an appointment on any day of the week, to have an X-ray of the chest This is a very valuable addition to the armaments of preventive medicine and is made use of by many who need reassurance because of vague suspicions of contact. It is particularly useful to the Public Health Department for the obtaining of quick reports on candidates for employment on the Borough Council staff. 25 26 -27= FOOD CONTROL Work on the observation and improvement of hygienic reception, storage, and sale of food continued throughout the year. No major infringements of the laws on Pood were discovered, but there seemed to be some increase annually during the past three years in the number of articles brought to the Department as having been bought in an unfit condition (see page 30 for list in 1961). More prosecutions under this heading were instituted in 1961 than in any year since 1951. It seems as if in shops possibly too much reliance is placed on the refrigerator as a food preserver and not enough care taken that food should be sold early and fresh. It is to be hoped that no food handler will be allowed to forget the importance of this and of scrupulous cleanliness within the refrigerators. Constant education of the food handler is also necessary in respect of smoking where food is prepared, failing to wash hands before touching food other people will be eating, and the need for personal hygiene at all times, clean hair, clean hands, clean clothing. Although there are plenty of food premises which still need much visiting and attention many of the local traders go far beyond the requirements of the Pood and Drugs Act in-their sanitary provisions. Mobile traders are required to provide themselves with suitable washing facilities under the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, and their vehicles require to be checked from time to time. NUMBER AND TYPE OF FOOD PREMISES IN THE BOROUGH Bakers and Confectioners 16 Butchers 40 Club Canteens 9 Confectioners (Sweets) 99 Cafes, Restaurants, Dining Rooms and Snack Bars 72 Factory and Staff Canteens 33 Fishmongers 14 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 53 Grocers, Provision Merchants, and General Stores 110 Ice Cream Manufacturers 2 Public Houses and Off Licences 80 School Canteens 18 Total 546 ICE CREAM The IceCream (Heat Treatment etc ) Regulations 1959 Throughout the year, routine visits were paid to two ice cream manufacturing premises situated within the Borough for the purpose of taking samples of ice cream, ice cream lollies, etc. for analysis. In addition, samples were taken from suppliers of ice cream etc. manufactured in premises not within the Borough. Periodic checks of the recording and indicating thermometers on the manufacturing apparatus were made and these were at all times, other than as reported below, found to satisfy the requirements of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations. Because of unsatisfactory results obtained from samples of ice cream taken from one ice-cream factory in Chiswick, a thorough investigation of the methods of manufacture of ice cream, and of the cleaning practices, was made. On investigation it was found that the equipment used in the manufacture of ice cream etc., was not being sterilised properly, (this was due to slackness with the staff), also the ice cream was not being held at 160°F, for the 10 minutes as required by the Heat Treatment Regulations, 1959, in order to complete pasteurisation Advice on methods of cleaning and sterilising was given. Since the investigation was completed, all samples of ice cream taken have been either Grade I or Grade II. Sampling During the year 123 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and the results obtained are as under: Grade Ice Cream Ice Lollies C r e am Lollies Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatisfactory I 30 - - 6 - - - - - II 53 - - - - - 2 - - III - 3 - - - - - - - IV - - 25 - - 2 - - 2 Totals 83 3 25 6 - 2 2 - 2 The above table has been compiled from results graded according to the following provisional grades set up by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, in relation to ice cream testing:- Grade Classification Bacterial Count I Below 500 II 500 - 20,000 III 20,000 - 100,000 IV If count is over 100,000 and/or Faecal Coli present In the area served by Ealing Public Health Laboratory, the bacteriological count which is carried out and the results of which are tabulated here, is much more sensitive than the chemical tests used elsewhere Although these chemical tests are sufficient for statutory requirements, the fact that the Medical Director of the Ealing Laboratory prefers the stricter control, is something for which the Borough citizens can be grateful as manufacturers of ice cream who have factories in other areas or who send out their products sometimes find that ice cream passed elsewhere as suitable for consumption because of the results of the chemical test, are in a less happy position here because the bacteriological findings lead to investigations and requests for improvement of equipment or hygienic method. 28- Registration of Premises Ice Cream The total number of premises registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Sec. 16, Food & Drugs Act, 1955, at the end of the year was as under: - Sale only 145 Manufacture and Sale 2 Storage only 1 Total 148 Preserved Foods The total number of premises registered in connection with the manufacture and/or preparation of preserved foods under Section 16 of the Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, at the end of the year was as under: - Sausage manufacture 5 Sausages and pickled meat 13 Cooking of ham and other meats 5 Total 23 27 visits were paid during the year to premises registered under this section. FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955 -29- 155 contraventions of the above-named Regulations were found and 125 remedied during 1961. Details of these contraventions are as follows:- Contravention Found Remedied Articles/Equipment not kept clean 6 3 Articles/Equipment not in good order 7 3 Food so placed as to involve risk of contamination 6 6 Food placed within 18"of ground and not adequately protected 10 10 Personal cleanliness not observed 5 3 Water Closets not kept clean and in efficient order 11 11 Insufficient lighting and ventilation to water closets 5 4 Absence of "Wash you hands" notices in water closets 3 4 Absence of suitable and sufficient wash-hand basins 5 5 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over wash-hand basins 9 6 Absence of soap, nail brushes, clean towels, etc. near wash hand basins 4 3 Absence of accommodation for clothing not worn during working hours 3 2 Absence of suitable and sufficient sinks for the washing of food and equipment 1 _ Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over sink 2 2 Absence of soap, clean cloths etc. at sink 1 1 Absence of suitable and sufficient ventilation in food rooms 2 2 Walls, floors, ceilings etc. not kept clean 17 13 Walls floors, ceilings etc. not kept in good order 6 5 Covered receptacle for refuse not provided 9 11 Accumulations of refuse etc. 14 9 Specified foods not stored at prescribed temperature 4 2 Inadequate or defective drainage 11 9 Absence of proper storage of food 5 3 Animals on premises 3 3 Rat proofing required 3 2 Miscellaneous 3 3 Totals 155 125 No prosecutions were undertaken for contravention of these Regulations. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS 111 visits were made to catering establishments during the year and in 27 cases it was necessary to give written or verbal intimation that work was required. FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year, 23 cases concerning food alleged to be unsound were received in the Department. -30- 13 cases were substantiated, the details of which are as follows:- Comp1 a int Action taken Foreign body in bottle of mineral water Warning letter Stone in fruit bun Warning letter Screw in sausage roll Warning letter Dirty milk bottle Court action - £5 fine and £6.8s.0d costs Cigarette in loaf Court action - £25 fine and £5.5s.0d. costs Mould on sausages Court action - £20 fine and £21 costs Fermentation of orange drink Warning letter Mould on pork pie Court acticfn - £20 fine and £5. 5s. 0d. costs Dirty milk bottle Court action - £5 fine and £5,5s.0d. costs Mould on fruit pudding Warning letter Mould in bread Warning letter Foreign matter in bread Warning letter Wood screw in loaf Court action - £50 fine and £8.5s.0d. costs FOOD SAMPLING By the courtesy of the Chief Officer, Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, the following details of food sampling within the Borough are available:- Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 22 - Butter 15 1 Cakes 3 3 Cream 11 - Drugs 11 - Pish and Pish Products 18 - Pruit 10 - Pruit Juice 2 - Ice Cream 15 - Liver 10 - Margarine 5 - Meat and Meat Products 32 - Preserves 3 - Sausages 7 3 Spirits 3 Soft Drinks 2 - Sweets 3 Vinegar and Non Brewed Condiment 11 - Miscellaneous Totalj 2 5 185 7 The total number of samples taken was again less than during the previous year i.e. 185 in 1961 compared with 205 in 1960 The number of unsatisfactory samples increased from 6 in 1960 to 7 in 1961. The following are the details from the Chief Officer's report on the 7 unsatisfactory samples and the action taken:- Butter A resident complained that he was served in a works canteen with a "buttered roll" in which margarine had been used. Analysis proved the complaint justified, but no action could be taken because the evidence was deemed not to be sufficient to sustain a prosecution. Cakes Another resident complained of cream buns and cream slices, which were sold as containing "real cream". Samples procured by the Department were analysed and contained imitation cream. The retailer' s supplier was prosecuted, was fined £25 and ordered to pay £10 10s.0d. toward the costs. Sausages Samples of sausages sold by a butcher were found to contain sulphur dioxide, which is a preservative. The quantity found was within the prescribed limit for sausages and the sale would have been proper had the presence of preservative been declared by notice at the time of sale. The seller was cautioned. -31- lerchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953 Inspections were carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 204 premises and a total of 799 displays were examined. Minor breaches of the Orders were dealt with by verbal warning. No infringement was reported. Safe Milk From the 1st January, 1961 the County Council became the licensing authority for the issue of licences to dealers with premises within its area and 45 such licences were issued in respect of the sale of milk to which the special designations "pasteurised", "sterilised" and "tuberculin tested" could be applied. The period for which these licences were granted has been extended from one year to five years. Fifty-five samples of milk were obtained to test that heat treatment and subsequent storage were properly carried out. One was not satisfactory, in that it failed the methylene blue test, This was found to be due to unsatisfactory storage at the retail shop, The prescribed notice of warning was sent to the shopkeeper. Fifty inspections of premises were made to ensure proper compliance with the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. Labelling of Food Order, 1953 The Labelling of Food Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller or to bear a registered trade mark, to be marked with its common or usual name and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredients It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed,, A total of 134 premises in the Borough were visited and 1, 504 items of food were examined for compliance with the Order. No infringements were disclosed. Labelling and Advertising Infringements In addition to the detail given above, a considerable volume of work was done in the period under review, which did not arise from samples procured in this Borough, but which had the effect of protecting the residents in all county districts. The matters dealt with were in respect of nationally retailed articles of food. Several manufacturers were required to designate the ingredients on labels of Instant Coffee, As a result of a complaint of the taste of a soft drink, investigations made in the Public Control Department showed that there was phenolic contamination which arose from a chemical reaction between chlorinated water and the phenol formaldehyde stopper. The manufacturer has modified the ingredients of this product to prevent the chemical reaction. The manufacturer of a non-alcoholic wine was challenged on the ground that the description was a contradiction in terms, and the label was amended to "nonalcoholic beverage' . The importer of a slimming food was challenged on claims made in advertising literature as to the Vitamin concentration, and the literature was corrected. A manufacturer" s claim of slimming properties for "reducing perles" was challenged and the product withdrawn. The claim relied on the presence of purgatives and bladderwrack -32- -33- The slimming claims made for a lemon juice in a television advertisement were modified after the manufacturer had been challenged as to the efficiency of the product as a slimming agent Modifications to the labels of several brands of canned chicken were secured where it was not apparent from the label that the contents of the cans were not solely chicken, but chicken in jelly or broth MEAT AND OTHER FOODS There are now no slaughterhouses operating in Brentford and Chiswick. FOOD CONDEMNED DURING THE YEAR 1961 Fruit and Vegetables 22$ tons Meat and Bacon 22½ cwts Perishable Goods 25¼ lbs Tinned Goods 6,432 tins Fish 6 stone Unsound food is disposed of by incineration tipping or for animal feeding MILK From 1st January, 1961 all licences for milk dealers were required to be issued by the Pood and Drugs Authority i.e. Middlesex County Council and in form a tion on this is included in the report of the Public Control Officer of that body see page 32. Registration of milk distributors is still carried out by the Public Health Department At the end of 1961 there were 63 such premises registered. BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 6 BRENTFORD MARKET Brentford Market is a large wholesale market for the sale of fruit vege tables and flowers, It covers an area of approximately 11 acres and is under the control of the Borough Council. The Corporation employs a staff of 18 at the market and there are approximately 450 holdings with approximately 150 tenants On busy days roughly 1 500 vehicles pass through the Market Modern sanitary conveniences are provided on the West side of the market and free washing facilities are available at this and other conveniences situated in the Market The Public Health Inspectors pay frequent visits to the market to confirm the maintenance of good sanitation and the Corporation employ the services of a firm of pest exterminators who pay visits to the Market every six weeks to ensure that it is kept free from rodent infestation. During 1961, the capacity of the Market was enlarged by the provision of 4 storage garages on the East side of the Market, Situated in the Market are also wholesalers who deal in groceries, tinned foods, etc., and in this connection the Public Health Inspectors visit for the condemnation of such goods as are reckoned to be unfit for human consumption, HEALTH EDUCATION Work on Health Education was continuous throughout the year The en couragement of hygienic living is the life work of the Public Health Inspector, who is visiting day after day, homes, shops, factories, restaurants, canteens, public houses and places where people congregate, always with the aim of sub stituting clean conditions for dirty, and in face to face conversation conveying ideas on matters of health and hygiene, In addition to our own work, other bodies such as County Council staff, medical staff in hospitals, and general practitioners in their practices, have many opportunities for teaching healthy living and prevention of illness and disease. Whenever teaching aids, poster or other printed material is required for the purpose of health teaching, it can be supplied from this Department. Since it seems that the public has become somewhat resistant to pictorial propaganda because of the amount of bombardment received in newspapers, on poster boards, in the cinema and on television,, there is need for posters of memorable design quick impact and if possible, wit. The Keep Britain Tidy' lion poster was an excellent example of this, simple, amusing, and still interesting after being seen thousands of times, and it was a pleasure to distribute. All new posters available on Health Subjects are studied, and a selection is made of those most likely to appeal They are posted on the public notice boards and local authority premises, and when the subject is suitable, sometimes in factory canteens and other establishments, Although often it is difficult to get persons, or groups of persons, to be as interested as they should be in living healthily, the fear of illhealth makes them very receptive to discussion of disease, operations and hospitals, so this strange mental quirk can be used by the practitioner of preventive medicine as a vehicle and during a talk on the failures of prevention (i.e. the persons who need the services of private doctor or hospital) suggestions on the achievement of success in prevention can be introduced. The Central Council for Health Education, to which the Borough Council subscribes, issued much information throughout 1961 on two topical subjects, The case for Fluoridation of Water Supplies' and Smoking and Lung Cancer" and use was made of their Cancer poster, their poster on prevention of scalding of young children and their dysentery and poliomyelitis leaflets. These latter were ordered in quantity and taken by any public health inspector paying a first visit to a house in which a case of one of these diseases occurred. -35- WELFARE OLD PEOPLE During 1961. 36 cases of old people in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. These cases are brought to our notice often by persons who feel the old person should be removed compulsorily for hiso,r.her own benefit but not every one knows the extent of the voluntary and statutory aid which can be given to an old person in need, and so happily, most of the time arrangements of some kind can be made to enable the old person to continue to live in the way which he wants in his own home or by patient persuasion over a long period to get him into a frame of mind which accepts voluntary admission to home or hospital Compulsory removal is a sad and undignified incident in the life of a human being, and must be genuinely and fully justified before being used In 1961 no compulsory removal of any old person was carried out. Details of the 36 cases are as follows f ■ ' Removed to hospital 10 Removed to Old People's Homes 3 Remained at home: - 23 (a) meals on wheels and home help provided 2 (b) meals only provided 3 (c) home help only provided 6 (d) home nurse and home help provided 1 (e) car and garage obtained (for invalid man) 1 (f) wireless obtained 1 (g) housing repairs carried out and/or cleanliness improved 2 (h) no help required 1 (i) all help refused 2 (j) awaiting vacancy in Old People's Home 1 (k) awaiting rehousing 3 During the year a total of 378 aged persons or aged chronic sick persons in the Borough received help from the Home Help Service and the Home Nurses dealt with 469 old people out of a total of 755 cases. These figures compare with 397 aged persons receiving help from the Home Help Service in 1960 and 501 old persons being visited by the Nurses out of a total of 785, The amount of sick nursing done by the statutory nurses seems to be dropping each year. 77 fewer cases were attended in 1961 than in 1959. Information supplied by the County Welfare Officer shows that during the year 24 old people from the Borough were admitted to Old People's Homes through the County Welfare Department, including eleven persons previously brought to our notice one in 1958 three in 1959 three in 1960 and four during 1961 Two of those admitted unfortunately did not wish to remain, returned home, and continue to be very difficult problems. The County Council has the duty, under the National Assistance Act 1948 of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them and it does this by admission to its own Homes or by meeting the cost of maintenance in Homes administered by registered Voluntary Organisations The County Council s Welfare Department is responsible for the County Homes and one such Home (known as Belfairs, in Grove Park Gardens) is situated in the Borough. Chiropody The service was maintained throughout the year by the Middlesex County Council whereby old people could have their foot defects treated at the surgeries of local chiropodists as reduced cost or free of charge. The number of persons treated in this scheme was 82 in 1961 In 1959 the Minister of Health invited local authorities to submit proposals for a chiropody service under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946 The proposals for Middlesex were approved in September 1960, and a service started at Chiswick in January 1961, and at Brentford in October 1961. During the year 147 persons made 526 attendances at the County Council's Foot Clinics,, A voluntary service of Chiropody is maintained by the Brentford Philanthropic Society for old people in the Brentford end of the Borough and served by a local chiropodist,, The fee to the patient is one shilling per foot and 140 persons had treatment in 1961. Old Folks Friendship Club This is a specially built club house opened in April, 1955, for the use as a social and recreational centre of old age pensioners living in Brentford and Chiswick^ The club is open Monday to Friday from 1 - 5 p.m, and there is an organiser in attendance. The old people are enrolled as members at their first attendance, membership costs only one penny per week, and there are 250 names on the register The members can visit every day, if they wish, for rest room or reading room facilities, or just to meet their friends and talk, but many social occasions are provided for them in the way of concerts, whist drives, etc A television set is installed in the lounge, a radiogram in the concert hall and a large billiard table is provided for the male members. Light refreshments are available„ This club also arranges summer outings (of which there were four in 1961) and an annual Christmas party. Three visits to West End Theatres at a cheap price were arranged during the Christmas season. Through this club the members are also able to obtain information about the special services at reduced rates which are available within the Borough for them such as laundry shoe repairs and hairdressing and they can be given advice on any difficulties that occur in their private liveSo A special blend of tea is also available at an economical pricec Members living alone are encouraged to make use of the S.0.S. card scheme, and have the card ready and completed with personal details for window display should an emergency occur. This is the only club premises open daily for the use of old age pensioners but there are other clubs meeting in different parts of the Borough once a week to which mobile old age pensioners become attached as members, for social and recreational purposes Brentford Old Folks Social Club This club meets every Wednesday 1.30 p.m. - 5 p.m. and has 150 members. The meetings are social with periodic visiting entertainers. There are 3 or 4 summer outings, a free tea once per month and two annual parties. Old Age Pensions Association (Brentford Branch) The membership of this Club has continued to rise, and in 1961 was over 100 There is a weekly meeting of a social nature with occasional Concert Parties Two free outings per year, an annual tea and a Christmas dinner are held The Association runs a penny a week club for sickness and deaths and had in 1961 two Sick Visitors who went to ailing members and took gifts of flowers, eggs or fruit from the Association to the sick persons -36- Old Age Pensions Association (Chiswick Branch; This association has a membership of over 140 and meets weekly for social purposes A free annual outing and Christmas Tea Party are held and in 1961 two additional outings were arranged Other Societies Several of the societies whose functions are classified under Welfare General contribute to a very considerable extent to the Welfare of the Elderly i.e. the British Red Cross Association the St John Ambulance Brigade the Blind Club, the Club for the Hard of Hearing the Chiswick Mission and the two Philanthropic Societies Slipper Baths Under the scheme for the provision at reduced rates (2d per bath) of slipper baths for old people at the Public Baths Establishments 2,051 baths were taken in Chiswick and 1,461 in Brentford Meals on Wheels The provision of a hot dinner once a day for an old person living alone may make all the difference between health and malnutrition The Meals on Wheels Service operated by the Brentford and Chiswick Welfare Organisation continued to expand during 1961 Many times the two vans which are now in operation each day from Monday to Friday were required to take round a number far in excess of the normal capacity and still a waiting list of old persons requiring the meals had to be maintained The number of meals rose from 17,215 supplied to 168 elderly persons in 1960 to 22 118 meals suppliedto 192 persons during 1961 In 1961 a survey of all persons receiving meals was planned the Welfare Officer prepared a comprehensive form to cover the likely requirements of old persons living alone and began to visit These visits could also be used as a check of need for the meals and also of whether the meals were liked or criticized by the recipients Following the initial survey the Welfare Officer would visit new recipients and from time to time revisit all recipients to check on supply of needs and any new problems arising Figures from these visits and of the needs and the action taken to help will be an interesting addition to next year's Report Laundry for the Incontinent Aged The scheme for the provision of laundry facilities for the incontinent aged started in the autumn of 1956 was carried on throughout the year Old people in need of this service were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff from various sources then arrangements were made for the Department's van to call each week to collect the soiled linen deliver it to the Laundry and to transport the clean linen back again to the home of the old person No charge was made for the service but for each case a certificate was submitted to the Public Health Committee During the year six old persons had been recommended for and obtained this service -37- Home Safety The North Thames Gas Board who in 1956 offered a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone continued to arrange for inspections during the year,, The reason for this was in order to reduce the risk of gas poisoning, a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer was to include free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances.

The County Council' s Welfare Department has provided two Welfare Visitors for persons in the Borough who are suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps other than those already mentioned and they work under the direction of the Area Welfare Officer They visit such persons in their own homes with a view to assisting them to obtain from statutory or voluntary sources (or both) facilities, appliances etc., which may benefit them. The help afforded may for example enable the disabled person to take part in social activities, choral classes dancing classes attend handcraft classes, obtain a needed holiday, or by provision of ramps for mechanical chairs handrails, lifting hoists and the like give a previously non existent measure of mobility to a person who was chair bound or house bound Where the circumstances require it, adaptations to houses including the provision of downstairs toilet facilities may be undertaken During 1961 special adaptations were made to five houses in the Borough tenanted by handicapped or elderly persons, Details of the work done are as follows -40- Case Work Done 1 Rail by batho 2 Rail by batho 3 Rail at front door. 4 Back living room floor raised to level of hall floor for use of wheel chair. 5 Purpose built flat by Council,, (Adaptations discussed by Housing Department and Welfare Department officials.)

Advice and guidance regarding personal problems are given, and membership of a voluntary organisation catering for a particular handicap is facilitated. Services to the deaf and dumb and the hard of hearing are provided by appropriate voluntary organisations, to which the County Council makes grants in aid,, Brentford and Chiswick choral classes for handicapped persons are held on Friday evenings at Belmont School, Belmont Road, Chiswick Each year this class takes part in the Choral Festival arranged for handicapped persons by the County Council. A special coach with an hydraulic lifting device at the back is in use for taking handicapped persons to club activities, handcraft classes and the choral classes, This coach is for those who cannot travel by public transport or in any other ordinary car or coach., Wheelchair cases can be lifted into the coach while remaining seated in their chairs. At 31st December, 1961, 125 residents of the Borough were registered as generally handicapped,. Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Services briefly referred to in this Report should apply to the Area Welfare Officer, Mr. J.F. Cronk, at the Local County Offices, Great West Road, Brentford. The Brentford and Chiswick Group of the Middlesex and Surrey League for the Hard of Hearing, meets weekly in the Borough, There are social meetings, lip reading and speaking classes, talks and discussions, outings and visits to other groups in the County. The Club has a Welfare Officer who visits sick and housebound members, The Group numbers 18 with an average attendance of 12-15.

The Club meets once a month for social purposes,, In 1961 the number on the register was 16 and the average attendance during 1961 was 12o The Chiswick Mission also owns two houses which are let to aged personsthe number of tenants is eight, and the tenants, each of whom has one room, pay a small nominal rento. -41° 42 = Holidays are provided for aged people at the Shaftesbury Society Holiday Home at Broadstairs and several Brentford and Chiswick members have had two weeks holiday there and there is also a Holiday Camp at Dovercourt for the aged physically handicapped to which two of the Borough's residents have been sent. The West London Branch of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, which has some 20 members in this Borough, continued its activities during 1961. The work undertaken included the visiting of disabled members in their homes, the organisation of social meetings and the provision of financial help with holidays, WELFARE RELIEF OF DISTRESS Brentford Philanthropic Society and Chiswick Philanthropic Society are charitable associations which exist to give help to any in need who are as yet outside of the many statutory provisions for Welfare, A request for help is followed by a visit from a representative of the Society and gifts of coal, extra comforts special foods, or help with payment for holidays are some of the many provisions which have been made. From the Chiswick Society the following assistance was given: Clothing and Bedding 3 Shoes 2 COal 5 Food 7 Wireless Set 1 Holiday 1 Chiropody Treatment 8 Outing to Brighton with High Tea and 2/6d. spending money 79 Christmas Gifts of 20/- each 240 Mulligan Trust Fund gift of 5/- each 22 Similar assistance was available from the Brentford Philanthropic Society, which also maintains a chiropody service free to needy elderly 180 visits were paid by the chiropodist during 1961. This Society distributed 64 tons of free coal in 1 cwt. lots each old person receiving an issue three times in the year 80 old people were provided with one week's holiday by the sea, free of cost, 718 Christmas gifts of 7/6d. each plus a box of biscuits each were distributed by the members on the Sunday before Christmas. 697 payments were made to enable old persons in need to have extra home help, A Christmas tea and entertainment was provided invitations being sent to 728 old people. The financial year of this Society extends from September to August and these figures therefore cover a different period from those in general throughout this Report, i.e. they include figures for the latter part of 1960 and the earlier part of 1961. During this period the Society purchased a house in Brentford and are actively preparing its conversion and equipment as an Eventide Home. WELFARE - SCHOOL CHILDREN In 1961 654 755 meals and 935,167 bottles of milk containing each one third of a pint were provided at Schools in this Borough. The percentage of children having milk in schools is as follows:- Primary 97.6% Secondary 71.7% Grammar 57.7% -43- The percentage of meals served to daily attendances:- January to December 1961 % of Attendance taking meals Average number taking meals Average Attendance Primary Schools Belmont Junior Mixed 53 98 185 Belmont Infants' 56 53 95 Beverley Road Infants' 90 133 148 Cavendish J.M. & Infants' 57.5 107 186 Ealing Road J.M, & Infants' 62.6 235 375 Grove Park J.lVh & Infants' 59 134 228 Hogarth Junior Mixed 61 184 303 Hogarth Infants' 56 66 118 Lionel Road J.M. & Infants' 68 177 261 St„ George's J.M. & Infants' 44 53 119 St. John's R.

This station was set up in response to a request from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for the establishment of additional stations throughout the country in areas of different atmospheric pollution potential, the results from which would be used in a national survey of atmospheric pollution It has been sited in the Borough's first Smoke Control Area and it is hoped that some interesting comparisons may be made with the results from the other stations in the Borough Unfortunately, readings were interrupted temporarily at the new station on account of alterations and repair works being carried out at the school and comparison of results can not yet have any real significance. Reports are submitted monthly to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on the information obtained from the three stations operating in the Borough for collation with those from the rest of the country A brief summary of the year s recordings is set out in Table XIV at the end of the book and Graph "C" has been prepared from these figures. The amount of pollution recorded continues to follow the pattern of previous years with only slight variations, For instance, there was a sharp rise in the concentrations of smoke and sulphur dioxide following the dense fog on 15th December, Examination of Graph ''C'' shows that concentrations are very similar, both for smoke and sulphur dioxide, at the three locations. The concentrations of smoke in Brentford and Chiswick, as compared with those of Leeds Central London and Lerwick (places representative of areas from industrial to virtually smokeless), are illustrated by Graph "D". The use of the two deposit gauges, for the measurement of grit deposits from the atmosphere, was discontinued early in the year. The deposit gauge provides information which is applicable only to the area immediately surrounding the instrument and does little to add to the general picture of atmospheric pollution However, it is a means of monitoring individual sources of pollution and will be available for this purpose when necessary. 132 visits or observations were made during the year in connection with premises which were suspected of causing atmospheric pollution or in respect of which complaints had been received that they were causing such pollution,, In no case was it necessary to take action other than informally and discussion on suitability of fuels and stoking methods helped to solve any smoke problems encountered It is good to know that the advice and assistance of the National Coal Board is always available in such cases. This is much appreciatedo Work on the establishment of further Smoke Control Areas within the Borough has proceeded during the year, full details of which are reported in the next section Further complaints were received about pollution by soot and grit from residents of the neighbourhood of Brentford Gas Works, On investigation these substances were found to be coming, not from the Gas Works but from another source and steps were taken to abate this nuisance. The opportunity was taken to obtain assistance from the Alkali Inspector and he reported that the Gas Works was now using 100% nut coal for carbonization, and that during the year a steam raising boiler had been converted from breeze firing to oil. -44- Clean Air Act,1956 The Borough's No. 2 Smoke Control Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on 30th January 1961 and came into operation on 1st October, 1961 The area now covered by Orders Nos. 1 and 2 totals 588 acres and contains 1,831 dwellings of which 424 are Council owned or controlled No domestic smoke offences were reported in the year in either of the Smoke Control Areas in operation and no solid fuel supply difficulties were encountered. During the year the survey of a third area of the Borough was commenced. This area is bounded on the north by the Great West Road (Cedars Road and Ellesmere Road Section), on the east by Park Road, on the west by the Richmond (District) Railway Line and on the south by the Southern Region Railway (Waterloo Line) The survey was not completed by the end of the year but it was anticipated that the Council would be ready to make a covering Smoke Control Order during the early part of 1962. The area covers approximately 109 acres and contains 1,564 dwellings of which 360 are Council owned or controlled Also included are 24 commercial and 5 miscellaneous premises, It is estimated that the total amount of bituminous coal burned per annum in this area and requiring replacement by smokeless fuels is 880 tons Other additional fuel requirements are 120,000 kilowatt hours of electricity and 16,580 therms of town gasc The number of visits and revisits made during the year in connection with Smoke Control Areas was 1,132. -45- GRAPH ''C" VARIATION IN AVERAGE MONTHLY CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE IN BRENTFORD AND CHISWICK DURING 1961 CONCENTRATIONS EXPRESSED IN MICROGRAMMES PER CUBIC METRE -46- GRAPH ''D" COMPARISON OF CONCENTRATIONS OF SMOKE IN THE AIR AT BRENTFORD, CHISWICK (2 STATIONS), CENTRAL LONDON, LEEDS AND LERWICK DURING 1961 CONCENTRATIONS EXPRESSED IN MICROGRAMMES PER CUBIC METRE -47- SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Visits The total number of visits and revisits made during the year was 5,496 and the following is a summary of these visits.

There are also a small number of catchpits for industrial wastes at industrial premises in the area, now amounting to seven in number Arrangements for the regular clearing of these cesspools and catchpits are made with the Borough Engineer" s Department of the Council Enquiries Outstanding Sanitary Notices During the year 1,129 enquiries were received from other Departments regarding outstanding sanitary notices with respect to certain properties in the district The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICES The whole of the district is supplied with water by the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board There is one well still in use in the Borough at Green's Boathouse Riverside Lands This well is used for washing purposes only, drinking water is obtained direct from mains, Reports on the bacteriological chemical and biological examination of the mains water supply carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board are issued from time to time and these have shown the water to be of satisfactory quality. The reports also show the state of purity of the water supply at its sources and after chlorination The quantity of the water supply has also been satisfactory during the year SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL The sewerage system for Brentford and Chiswick is mainly a "separate" system in which surface water drainage and foul drainage are kept separate with two sets of drains along streets to which the various connections can be made. In a few of the older areas of the Borough no surface water drainage exists and in these areas the foul and surface water drainage from properties is all taken into the foul sewer while surface water drainage from highways is taken into soakaways The surface water drainage system is split into areas throughout the Borough and each area has an outfall into the River Thames There are approximately 18 outfalls of this kind along the length of the River within the Borough., The foul drainage system is based on the two areas of Brentford and Chiswick, each area draining to one point within its boundary The Brentford area drains to Town Meadow Depot and the Chiswick area to Corney Road Depot Before the advent of the West Middlesex Drainage Board the sewage received at Town Meadow Depot was pumped to a sewage disposal plant situated at Clayponds Gardens, and the sewage received at Corney Road Depot was treated at a plant within the Depot, both plants having outfalls into the Thames for effluent Since the West Middlesex Drainage Board came into operation, the two sewage plants in the Borough have ceased to operate and the two Depots were connected to a trunk sewer owned by the Board and running through the Borough The sewage from the Borough is carried by the trunk sewer to Mogden Works and treated and disposed of there It must be noted that the drainage system joins the trunk sewer in only two places -50- The sewerage system of the Borough is, in general, considered to be sufficient to cope with the present and any likely future flows which may result from new development. REFUSE COLLECTION Refuse is collected once per week from each house in the Borough and is disposed of, by collecting freighters, to a Controlled Tip outside the Borough. -51- HOUSING RENT ACT, 1957 Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (1) Number of applications for certificates 2 (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates - (3) Number of decisions to issue certificates (a) in respect of some but not all defects 2 (b) in respect of all defects - (4) Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 1 (5) Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule - (6) Number of Certificates issued 1 Applications for Cancellation of Certificates (7) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of certificates 1 (8) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates - (9) Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objection - (10) Certificates cancelled by Local Authority 2 HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959 Number of Grants for Improvements and Conversions 41 HOUSING ACT, 1957 Details of the year' s work in connection with the large programme for the clearance of unfit houses in the Borough, are set out below and show the progress made with the re-housing of the occupants and with the demolition of the unfit houses in Clearance Areas and houses elsewhere, including the remainder of those previously reported in the years 1956 - 1960, Albany Road No 5 Compulsory Purchase Order, 1957 Nos. 69-77 (odd numbers) Albany Road, Brentford (Demolished 1959) Nos. 258/259 High Street, Brentford, and Nos. 263 -272 (consecutive numbers) High Street, Brentford.

Pollution of the atmosphere, the use of nuclear fission material in industry and in hospitals, and control of the transport of radioactive material are still matters for which the Central Atomic Authority maintains complete control, and although it is now in the legislation that this authority can be notified of registrations of premises within the Borough where the use of radioactive material is permitted, no information of this kind has been received It would be very useful to have a monthly report, similar to that of the Metropolitan Water Board, which is excellent, on findings on the radioactive state of the upper air, and on the quantities of isotopes and other radioactive material brought into the Borough, and also a notice beforehand of all transport of such material through the Borough, since with our great trunk roads from the West this must be considerable, with the increase of nuclear power stations and the growing use of radioactive material in research, in a great variety of industrial processes, in investigation of disease, and also its treatment, and with the possibility of nuclear powered cars and aeroplanes in the offing, sooner or later Medical Officers of Health must have this information in order to carry out the statutory duty imposed by Act of Parliament, to enquire into and become aware of any matter likely to affect the health of the public. - 64- HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee Brentford Hospital, Chiswick Maternity Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Clayponds Wing (formerly Clayponds Hospital) are situated within the Borough and are administered by the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee under the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946.
