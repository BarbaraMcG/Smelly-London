AC- 4369 PLON 76 124 CORPORATION OF LONDON PORT HEALTH AUTHORITY ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH To 31st DECEMBER, 1968 To be presented, 15th January, 1970 CONSTITUTION AND JURISDICTION The governing body of the City of London, the Corporation of London, was originally constituted the Sanitary Authority of the Port of London by Section 20 of the Public Health Act, 1872. The cost of administration was met from the Corporation's private funds for close on fifty years, when it became rate (and grant) aided. By the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the term "Port Sanitary" was changed to "Port Health", and the Port Health district is further defined by that Act as the "Port of London as established for the purposes of the law relating to the Customs of the United Kingdom" and by the Public Health Act, 1936 as "the Port as established for the purposes of the enactments relating to the Customs". The Public Health (London) Act 1936 was repealed by the London Government Act 1963 but Section 89 (1) of that Act defined the Port of London as "the Port of that name established for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise." In accordance with the provisions of the London Port Health Authority Order 1965 made under Section 41 (1) of the London Government Act 1963 the Corporation of London shall have jurisdiction as Port Health Authority- (a) as respects functions, rights and liabilities of a local authority under the enactments mentioned in Part I of Schedule I of the Order over all waters within the Port and over such part of the district of any riparian authority as comprises the whole of any wharf and of the area within the gates of any dock and the buildings thereon respectively, forming part of or abutting upon the Port. (b) as respects any other functions, rights and liabilities assigned to them, within the Port (The Port of London established for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise.) The limits of the Port of London for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise were originally defined by a Treasury Minute dated 1st August, 1883. They commence at high water mark in the River Thames at Teddington Lock, in the County of Surrey, and extend down both sides of the said River Thames to an imaginary straight line drawn from the Pilot mark at the entrance of Havengore Creek in the County of Essex, to the land's end at Warden Point, in the Isle of Sheppey, in the County of Kent, such point being the north-western limit of the Port of Faversham, and extend up and include both sides of the River Medway to an imaginary straight line drawn from the south-east point of land westward of Coalmouth Creek, thence across the said River Medway to the western-most point of the piece of land which forms the eastern side of Stangate Creek,[ or, in other words, the north-west point of Fleet Marsh and thence in a southerly direction to Iwade Church in the said County of Kent, and thence in a north-easterly direction to Elmley Chapel in the said Isle of Sheppey, a supposed direct line from Elmley Chapel to Iwade Church, being the western limit of the Port of Faversham, and the said Port of London includes the Islands of Havengore Creek aforesaid, called Potton and Rushley Islands, and so much of the said Creek and Watercourses as extends from it to the town of Rochford, and also includes all other Islands, Rivers, Streams, Creeks, Waters, Watercourses, Channels, Harbours, Docks and places within the before-mentioned limits contained. Following upon the extension of the area of jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority by the Port of London Authority (Extension of Seaward Limit) Act 1964 the area of jurisdiction of the Corporation of London as Port Health Authority was similarly amended by Section 31 of the City of London (Various Powers) Act 1965 which added at the end of the definition of "Port of London" in Section 89 (1) of the London Government Act 1963 the following words: "together with all such waters between the seaward limit of the Port as so established ar.d imaginary straight lines drawn from latitude 51° 37' 00" north, longitude 00° 57' 19" east (Foulness Point in the County of Essex) to latitude 51° 46' 05" north, longitude 01°"20' 32" east (Gunfleet Old Lighthouse) and thence to latitude 51° 26' 36" north, longitude 01° 25' 30" east and thence to latitude 51° 24' 55" north, longitude 00° 54' 21" east (Warden Point in the County of Kent) as are for the i time being within the territorial waters of Her Majesty's dominions." The Portof London Authority with which the Port Health Authority works in close co-operation was established as the administrative body of the Port of London including the docks and tideway of the River Thames, by Act of Parliament in 1909. January, 1969. To: THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COMMONERS OF THE CORPORATION OF LONDON. My Lord Mayor, Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit as Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1968. A letter from the Secretary, Ministry of Health, dated November 1963, indicated that the Medical Officer of Health should prepare his Annual Report in accordance with Form Port 20. Paragraph 5 of this Form requires that, so far as Sections 1, V, VI, VIII, XIV, XV and XVI are concerned information which has been given in an earlier year and has not since changed need not be repeated each year but only changes occuring during the year. A recapitulation of all information is required quinquennially from the year 1955 but for the intermediate years where there is no change, "No Change" should be entered. This Report has been prepared in accordance with the above directive. I wish to record appreciation of the collaboration and assistance rendered by Her Majesty's Customs, the Pilots, the Immigration Officers, the Port of London Authority, the Shipping Federation, the staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants, the staffs of the Central Public Health Laboratory, the "Dreadnought" Seamen's Hospital and St. Andrew's Hospital, the Public Analyst, the Emergency Bed Service, the Regional Hospital Boards and Hospital Management Committees concerned, and all those who have so generously and willingly helped in every aspect of port health work throughout the year, particularly the Chairman, Members and staff of the Port and City of London Health Committee. I have the honour to be, Lady and Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, W.G. SWANN, M.D., B.Sc., Medical Officer of Health, Port and City of London.

The Port of London trades with all parts of the world. SECTION I\ INLAND BARGE I R\I I l< Barges are registered annually by the Port of London Authority. They vary in design, type and carrying capacity from open or hatched all purpose general cargo lighters to specialised craft designed for the transport of refrigerated cargoes, raw bulk sugar and bulk liquids (e.g. rendered edible animal fats and vegetable oils). Some refrigerated lighters have an integral refrigeration plant incorporated in their design and the bulk liquid lighters have a steam heating coil system installed in their tanks. It would appear that economic pressures exerted on the lighterage industry by way of Port modernisation and development in the lower River sector associated with containerisation has resulted in the amalgamation of fleets and the scrapping of old or uneconomic units. The competition of road and rail may also have been a contributory factor in the reduction of the number of lighters. The end result has been that the number of lighters operating throughout the Port area and its environs, byway of creeks and canals, has been further reduced since last year. There are now approximately 4,000 lighters having an aggregate tonnage of some 400,000 tons. It would appear likely, however, that though the number of lighters may decrease from year to year the actual carrying capacity may not necessarily be reduced in direct proportion. Evidence of a trend towards bigger and better lighters may be assumed from a press report on the purchase of a 1,000 ton lighter for operation on the River. The cleanliness of lighters, barges or other vessels intended for the movement of food is controlled under the provisions of the Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers etc.) Regulations of 1960. Due regard is paid to this aspect of hygiene to obviate any possible contamination, including contamination by odour, of foodstuffs which are carried in lighters. SECTION \ WATER SUPPLY (1) Source of Supply No change (2) Reports of tests for contamination No change (3) Precautions taken against contamination of hydrants and hosepipes No change (4) Number and sanitary conditions of water boats and powers of control by the Authority No change 5 There were eighteen reports of contamination in samples drawn from hydrants during the year of which fourteen samples were associated with newly laid water mains to the new quay extensions in Tilbury Dock. The samples were drawn prior to the berths becoming operational. The supply of water to shipping was withheld until a potable standard was achieved. The remaining four cases of hydrant contamination were discovered during the normal course of routine sampling. There were seven reports of contamination in samples derived from the Royal Group of Docks from standpipes and twelve reports of contamination from the ends of delivery hoses used to supply ships. The cause of the contamination of standpipes and supply hoses, which was also discovered during the course of routine sampling, was investigated as a matter of normal procedure. No attributable cause was discovered and it was assumed that the contamination had been introduced through unhygienic handling of the watering equipment. No ship was supplied with "unfit" water. There were thirty reports of contamination in the distribution supplies on board ships. These, samples were drawn mainly from fresh water taps over galley and messroom sinks. The source of supply to these taps is derived from "domestic fresh water storage" contained in double bottoms and peak tanks. Three samples of fresh water drawn directly from storage tanks were found to be contaminated. The possible sources of contamination in the cases of the domestic supply and storage tanks were investigated. The most likely causes were considered to be the possible introduction of contaminated water loaded in foreign ports or the incorrect use of engineroom pumps used in the filling or topping up of the fresh water gravity feed tanks or the transfer of fresh water for the purpose of adjusting the stability or the trim of the ship. In each case the standard practice of cleaning followed by chlorination of the tanks and supply lines was adopted. Due regard is paid to the co-operation this Authority has received from other United Kingdom and Continental Ports through the interchange of adverse fresh water sampling reports in respect of those ships where some degree of contamination in the fresh water on board was discovered subsequent to departure for another United Kingdom or Continental Port. This interchange of information enables follow-up visits to be made by the Port Health Authorities concerned and enables remedial measures to be taken before the ship sails. Four samples drawn from the tanks and eight samples drawn from the end of delivery hoses of the water boats purveying fresh water in the Port showed contamination. In each case the standard procedure of tank cleaning and/or chlorination of the tank and supply hoses was carried out. The 89.39% of "satisfactory", "good" and "excellent" results in the fresh water supplies in the District as shown in Table 2 compares favourably with the precentage figure obtained in previous years and indicates that a satisfactory standard of potable water supply is available in this Port.

SECTION VI PIBLIC HEALTH (SHIPS) REGULATIONS 1966 1. List ol Infected Areas (Regulation 6) Arrangements for the preparation and amendment of the list, the form of the list, the persons to whom it is supplied, and the procedure for supplying it to those persons:- NO CHANGE 7 1 (a) International Vaccination Certificates (Regulation 9 (3) ) By the provision of the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1966, the Medical Officer may require the production of international certificates of vaccination against smallpox by persons arriving from abroad and will require production of such certificates if so requested by the Minister of Health. The Minister has requested that all persons arriving on ships coming within 14 days from smallpox locally infected or endemic areas be in possession of such a certificate and this applies whether the persons have themselves come from these areas or not. Because of the difficulty of examining vaccination certificates of persons arriving in the Port of London where ships discharge their passengers at widely divergent points, shipping companies have been asked to arrange for lists of smallpox vaccination certificates of passengers and crew, counter-signed by the Master and by the ship's surgeon, if carried, to be produced on the arrival of the ship in the Port. 2. Radio Messages (a) Arrangements for sending permission by radio for ships to enter the district (Regulation 13):- NO CHANGE (b) Arrangements for receiving messages by radio from ships and for acting thereon. (Regulation 14 (1) (a) and 14 (2) ):— NO CHANGE 3. Notifications otherwise than by radio (Regulation 14 (1) (b) ) Arrangements for receiving notifications otherwise than by radio and for acting thereon:— NO CHANGE 3(a) Maritime Declaration of Health (Regulation 16) During the year the instructions to Masters contained in the Maritime Declaration of Health were altered to read as follows:— PUBLIC HEALTH (SHIPS) REGULATIONS, 1966 DIRECTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS These directions and requirements are made by the Medical Officer of Health for the Port and City of London in pursuance of the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1966 and compliance therewith is required by virtue of Regulation 36 of the said Regulations. TO THE MASTER OF ANY SHIP APPROACHING THE PORT OF LONDON FROM A FOREIGN PORT I You should ascertain the state of health of all persons on board. II You must complete, sign and deliver the foregoing Maritime Declaration of Health unless your ship has on this voyage been only to excepted Ports or has already been cleared at a Port in the United Kingdom. Make sure that all parts are completed and that it is countersigned by the ship's surgeon if one is carriedi. III If the answer to any question on page 1 is 'Yes' OR if your ship has, during the last 28 days, been in any Port in all Asia, Africa (including transit through the Suez Canal) the Americas (excluding the U.S.A., Canada and transit through the Panama Canal) or any area locally infected with a quarantinable disease, you must:— (A) send a Wireless Message to "Portelth London" stating (1) the name of the ship, (2) the estimated time of arrival in the Lower Hope Reach. If your ship is berthing or anchoring below the Lower Hope, give the estimated time of arrival and the name of the berth or anchorage. (3) numbers, ages and sex of all persons on board who are ill and your best estimate of v what is wrong with them. This message must be sent not more than 12 hours and whenever practicable not less than four hours before the estimated ti me of arrival. (B) (1) If your ship is proceeding to a mooring or berth in the Port down river of No. 1 8 ing Buoy:- Show or give the following signals:— (a) the international three-flag signal L I M flown at the masthead or where it can be seen from the shore until instructed by the Port Health Authority or a Customs Officer that it is no longer necessary; and (b) betweem sunset and sunrise, either:— (i) the signal LIM flashed in the Morse code by lamp, at thirty second intervals, or (ii) a signal consisting of a red light over a white light, the lights being not more than six feet apart, shown at the peak or where the signal can best be seen from the shore, such signals to be given from No. 1 Sea Reach 3uoy until an authorised officer of the Port Health Authority or a Customs Officer has boarded the ship. (2) If your ship is proceeding to a mooring or berth up river of No. 1 Mucking Buoy:- Show or give the following signals:— (a) the international three-flag signal LIM flown at the masthead or where it can best be seai from the shore until instructed by the Port Health Authority or a Customs Officer that it is no longer necessary; and (b) between sunset and sunrise, either:— (i) the signal L I M flashed in the Morse code by lamp, at thirty second intervals or (ii) a signal consisting of a red light over a white light, the lights being not more than six feet apart, shown at the peak where the signal can best be seen from the shore, such signals to be given from No. 1 Mucking Buoy until an authorised officer of the Port Health Authority or a Customs Officer has boarded the ship. (c) have a list of passengers and crew ready to hand to the Boarding Medical Officer giving addresses of immediate destination in the United Kingdom. IV The procedure set out in III (B) (2) above will expedite the boarding of your ship by the Medical Officer and this will normally take place in the Lower Hope Reach. To avoid delay to your ship you should, on sighting the Medical Officer's Launch, reduce speed sufficiently for it to come along side. Hand this Declaration to the Medical Officer together with lists of names and addresses for all passengers and crew. You must not proceed up River beyond Gravesend Pilot Station until your ship has been cleared from health control. V If the answer to all the questions on page one is 'NO' AND the ship has not called during the last 28 days at a Port in any of the places mentioned in paragraph III above, health clearance of your ship will be dealt with by an Officer of H.M. Customs on your arrival at your berth. In these circumstances you need not communicate with the Port Health Authority and your ship will not be boarded by the Medical Officer. VI If your ship has been in any port in all Asia, Africa (including transit through the Suez Canal) or the Americas (excluding the U.S.A., Canada and transit through the Panama Canal), during the last 14 days, OR any area locally infected with smallpox at any time during the same period, you must have ready for inspection by the Medical Officer as soon as he boards your ship:— (a) a valid International Vaccination Certificate against Smallpox for each person on board (passenger or crew). or (b) a list, signed by you, of all passengers and crew members, giving the date of last vaccination against smallpox for each person, as recorded in his certificate, (Provision of this list does not prejudice the Medical Officer's right to inspect the actual certificates if he considers it necessary, but will help considerably to cut down delay in clearing the ship). VII The Master of a ship approaching the Port of London who has any doubts or difficulties over Port Health Regulations should obtain advice direct from the Medical Officer, through the Thames Navigation Service (V.H.F.R/T). It is also possible for ships without V.H.F. R/T to consult the Medical Officer through North Foreland Radio Station. Information and advice on any other medical problems are available by the same channels. NOTE: Regulation 18 (1) of the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1966 states:- 'On the arrival of a ship from any foreign port or from any infected area which is not a foreign port, no person other than a Pilot, a Customs Officer, and Immigration Officer or an authorised officer shall, without the permission of the Medical Officer, board or leave the ship until it is free from control under these regulations, and the Master shall take all steps necessary to secure compliance with this provision'.

These very large vessels which carry bulk oil are at present unable to enter British or Continental Ports fully laden. It would therefore be necessary for the V.L.C.C. to be lightened in a sheltered coastal bay close to the ultimate destination of the oil cargo. To this end a lightening vessel would be employed to receive the requisite amount of cargo to permit the VjL.C.C. to proceed to a U.K. or Continental Port for ultimate discharge. The lightening ship would also discharge atatU.K. or Continental Port. The areas considered, so far as the U.K. was concerned, for the transfer operations to take place were Lyme Bay, the Suffolk Coast ncrth of Felixstowe, the Liverpool side of Anglesey Bay and the Clyde estuary between Arra'n and Ayrshire. The actual operation would occur outside of British territorial waters, but within ten miies of the U.K. coast. An area off Cherbourg was considered to be suitable for cargoes destined to that part of Europe. The operations would clearly involve some intermingling of the ViL.C.C. crews with those of the lightening vessels and it was considered that this could result in health risks. Accordingly the Ministry of Health, Her Majesty's Customs and the oil company concerned agreed on the adoption of a standard practice whereby the lightening vessel would obtain aHcclaration of Health from the Master of the V.L.C.C. irrespective of whether the lightening operation took place inside or outside of territorial waters. The Declaration of Health would be produced either to the Port Health Authority or H.M. Customs in the United Kingdom (if the lightening vessel entered a United Kingdom port to discharge her cargo)or to the appropriate authorities abroad should the lightening vessel proceed there from the lightening operation. The Port of London was directly concerned in the first massive transfer of crude oil at sea when the V.L.C.C., "MACOMA" of 207,000 tons, deadweight, from Mena al Ahmadi (Kuwait) with a crew of forty-one rendezvoused with the lightening vessel "DRUPA" of 70,000 tons deadweight (crew of fifty one) in Lyme Bay on the 30th May. Some 70,000 tons of crude oil were transferred to the "DRUPA" in a period of 24 hours. After the transfer was completed the "MACOMA" continued her voyage to Rotterdam and the "DRUPA" proceeded to Shellhaven where she arrived on the 1st June. The Master of the "DRUPA" produced two Declarations of Health. One in respect of his own vessel and one in respect of the "MACOMA" completed at Lyme Bay and dated the 30th May. There had been no sickness on the voyage of the "MACOMA" and no sickness had occurred on the voyage of the "DRUPA", consequently pratique was granted on the latter vessel's arrival at Thameshaven. The lightening operation was repeated on seven occasions during the year and the agreed standard practice worked well. On three occasions the V.L.C.C. herself berthed at Thameshaven. Lighter Aboard Ship Development The concept evolved during World War II of assault craft operating between an offshore mother ship and a beach head or harbour has now been further developed to suit the requirements of the commercial carriage of goods by sea. During the latter part of the year a well known American Shipping Company with a long tradition of trading to this Port announced the building of three "Seabee clipper" ships. It would appear from press reports that these ships will be of approximately 44,000 tons deadweight with a capacity of 38 barges carrying 17,500 tons of cargo; 1,600 I.S.O. Containers; a tank capacity of some 15,000 tons for liquid cargo and a heavy lift of 2,000 tons capacity at the stern to load and discharge two lighters simultaneously. It is claimed that loading and discharge would be completed in a period of 13 hours. It will be essential for this and other forms of LASH ships to anchor or moor in a sheltered open stretch of deep water, avoiding as far as possible main tidal currents and in an area reasonably free of other traffic in order that discharge and loading of lighters may be carried out in safety. The loaded lighters will be towed by tugs to specified wharves within a reasonable distance of the LASH ship for discharge, H.Mi.C. clearance and ultimate distribution of the cargo. 10 It is not yet known at precisely which ports in the United Kingdom these ships will carry out these operations. The number of ports of call is however likely to be very few in number. The mouth of the River Medway for the reception of the ship and Sheerness for the reception of the lighters is being seriously considered. Both of these areas are within the jurisdiction of this Authority. It would appear that as a LASH ship will enter at least the seaward limits of a port, Pratique will be granted before operations commence. The health risks associated with a V.L.C.C. would therefore be inapplicable to a LASH ship. MEDICAL INSPECTIONS AT GRAVESEND Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec.

The nursing and administrative control lies with the Dartford Hospital Management Committee. The number of cases admitted to Denton Hospital in 1968 was as follows:- Influenza 5 Chickenpox 8 Measles 2 Tonsillitis 5 Malaria 1 Infective hepatitis 2 Miscellaneous 1 24 11 SECTION VII SMALLPOX 1. Name of Isolation Hospital to which smallpox cases are sent from the District. Long Reach Hospital is situated on the south bank of the River Thames about eight miles above Gravesend. The hospital consists of 10 ward blocks capable of accommodating 170 patients but, except in cases of emergency, only three ward blocks (2 of 20 beds and 1, a cubicle ward, of 10 beds, total 50 beds) are kept available for immediate use. The hospital includes residential quarters for the staff and laundry, although the administration and staffing is carried out from Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford. 2. Arrangements for transport of such cases to that Hospital by ambulance giving the name of the Authority responsible for the ambulance and the vaccinal state of the ambulance crews. A case or cases of smallpox would be removed from the vessel by this Authority's Ambulance launch and conveyed ashore via the pontoon at Denton and from thence conveyed by road ambulance direct to Long Reach Hospital. The Port Health Authority would be responsible for the vaccinal state of their Ambulance Launch crews, while the vaccinal state of the Road Ambulance personnel would be the concern of the ambulance authority, the Greater London Council.

Typhoid Fever On the 1st April a ship arrived in the Port of London from Australia via Durban, (for bunkers), and Hull, where she had part discharged refrigerated and general cargo. The whole of the crew except the Master, a junior engineer officer and the ship's butcher had signed off articles at Hull and had been replaced by a temporary crew for the coastal passage. No sickness on board was reported on arrival in London. However, on the same day a message was received from the Medical Officer of Health of the Hull and Goole Port Health Authority that the voyage radio officer had, subsequently to disembarkation, at Hull, become ill with food poisoning and that Salmonella typhimurium had been isolated (Case A). The Medical Officer of Health for the Port of Hull had informed the Medical Officer of Health of each district concerned, of the names and addresses to which the voyage crew had proceeded. A thorough inspection of the accommodation including the dry and refrigerated provision store rooms, galley, pantries and cafeteria was carried out and all of these compartments were found to be clean and well maintained. The medical log showed one case of peptic ulcer and three cases of gastro-enteritis as having occurred during the voyage. The ship was placed under surveillance and was visited daily. No further reports were being received from Hull and it was considered that the case of Salmonellosis had been an isolated one. On the 11th April the first of the voyage crew members, a galley boy, returned on board from leave and resumed duties, which included washing dishes and preparing vegetables. Three days later the boy's parents visited him on board and brought with them a: letter from his local health authority which stated that his stools had been found positive to tests and that S. typhimurium had been isolated. The boy was thereupon landed and admitted to the Seamen's Hospital at Greenwich (Case B). On the 17th April anAble Seaman returned on board from leave who had also proved positive to tests for S. typhimurium. He was thereupon also landed and admitted to the same hospital. (Case C). A pattern had now emerged as Case A was the case recorded as peptic ulcer in the ship's medical log and Cases B and C were two out of three cases of gastro-enteritis also recorded therein. The ship was scheduled to sail direct for Australian Ports on the 25th April. A conference 14 was held on board on the 17th April attended by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health and an urgent full scale operation was launched to find further cases or carriers as follows:- (i) All ships company who had been on board from the 11th to 17th April were requested to submit faecal specimens. (ii) Names and addresses of all shore staff who had eaten on board during the same period to be obtained. The first faecal specimens were sent to the Pathology Laboratory at Greenwich Hospital on the 19th April. Further specimens were delivered daily as collected. On the 23rd April two engine room ratings reported to the Shipping Federation Medical Centre suffering from sickness and diarrhoea. Both ratings were interviewed and detailed accounts taken of their movements and food consumed. It was established from this that these two cases were not related to the food poisoning being investigated on board. Further stool samples were however sent to the laboratory. These eventually proved negative. The first results on the stool specimens were received from the laboratory on the 24th April and continued to be received almost daily thereafter. On this date a junior engineer officer returnr ed to the ship from leave and reported that S. typhimurium had been isolated from his stools and the condition had not responded to treatment. He was therefore signed off and returned home to continue treatment (Case D). Information was also being received from the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of Hull and Goole regarding the results of tests carried out in other parts of the country on crew members who had disembarked at Hull. It was therefore possible to pick out those members who had not for one reason or another submitted samples elsewhere, and stool samples were obtained from them by 26th April. Fortunately, from the preventive medicine point of view, the sailing date of the ship had now been put off to the 29th April. A further positive excretor was reported by the laboratory on the 26th April. This was another junior engineer officer and he was signed off and sent home to receive treatment (Case E). The outstanding results on stool specimens were received on 29th April, which was sailing day. All of these results were reported as negative. A final visit to the ship was made and the ship's company were reported well. Advice was given to the Master and the Purser/Catering Officer regarding suggested action to be taken should any further cases arise. This included references in the Ship Captains Medical Guide and copies of the Authority's "Clean Food Handling" booklet were left on board for distribution. The rationale for the investigation at such a late date after the first onset, was to look for carriers rather than the cause of the infection, as it was virtually impossible to trace food in use at the time in question, the ship having taken on harbour stores in Hull for the coastwise voyage. The only information that was given was to the effect that some cartons of deep frozen fish had, on thawing out, been found to smell rather badly — and these were not used. On this basis the the remaining cartons of fish had been rejected by the Ministry of Transport Ship Surveyor at Hull and'had been dumped at sea. Water supplies were not investigated because the number of cases and the time interval between taking water in Australia and the first case did not justify any suspicion of infection from this source. The investigation was complicated by the two engineroom ratings reporting sickness with diarrhoea — yet faecal samples proved negative, twice on one and once on the other rating. Likewise, results from the pathology laboratory at Greenwich on tests from the able seaman (Case C), and galley boy (Case B) proved negative for both faecal and blood samples. A total of 51 faecal samples were taken. These covered (1) All hands aboard ship period 11th - 18th April. (2) All inward voyage crew on board on arrival in London. (3) All hands returning to ship from leave but not previously sampled. Of the 51 samples submitted one proved positive (Case E). Great difficulty was encountered in trying to cover every person aboard ship during the time of the investigation, as the ship appeared at times to be a clearing centre for crew staffing others of the company's ships in port. Of the five cases found, all except case D had been entered in the Medical logduringthe homeward voyage. Cases A, B & C are mentioned above. Case E was the third case of gastroenteritis. The exact source of the infection will never be known. However, every effort was made to ascertain that the ship sailed without any carriers on board and that the whole of the ship's catering compartments were thoroughly clean and disinfected. It should be emphasised that a person can be prohibited by a Port Health Authority from embarking on a ship only when he is 15 suffering from, or suspected to be suffering from, a quarantinable disease. Typhoid fever is not such a disease and action to prevent cases or carriers embarking on a ship can be taken only on instructions from the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security. The amount of work put in by the staff of the Port Health Authority during this investigation was very great and record should be made of the fact that their efforts were very much appreciated. Thanks should also be expressed to the staff of the Shipping Company concerned for their help and co-operation. SECTION X OBSERVATIONS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF MALARIA ON SHIPS Four cases of Malaria were reported in seamen admitted to hospital after the arrival of their ships during the year under review. Three cases occurred in 1967. SECTION XI MEASURES TAKEN AGAINST SHIPS INFECTED OR SUSPECTED OF PLAGUE No ships infected with plague (or suspected plague) arrived during the year. SECTION XII MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS IN SHIPS FROM FOREIGN PORTS (i) Procedure for inspection of ships for rats The Port Health Authority employs an experienced and competent team of seventeen Rodent Inspectors, who exercise control measures on all ships and shore premises within the Port area under the supervision of the Port Health Inspectors. The Rodent Inspector's first duty is to visit all ships arriving in his district as soon as possible after arrival and search for evidence of rodents. Priority is given to ships which have arrived from plague endemic areas. Further visits to these ships are made during the discharge of cargo to ascertain the degree of infestation on board, if any, and to ensure that reasonable measures are adopted to reduce the number of rodents on board to a negligible number and prevent any rodents escaping ashore. His second duty is the inspection of ships in his area for the specific purpose of issuing Deratting or Deratting Exemption Certificates or Rodent Control Certificates. The Rodent Inspector's third duty is the inspection of shore premises and lighters for signs of rodent infestation. The Port Health Authority has continued to operate a Rodent Control Scheme, inaugurated twenty-seven years ago, covering all the docks and including all the premises of the Port of London Authority on behalf of that Authority and premises of tenants of the Authority on behalf of the occupiers. (ii) Arrangements for the bacteriological examination of rodents, with special reference to rodent plague, including the number of rodents sent for examination during the year. All dead rats to be examined for evidence of plague are promptly dispatched in cylindrical aluminium containers with a screw cap to the Public Health Laboratory at County Hall. Specimen rats are placed in polythene bags previously dusted with gammaxene powder to kill any parasites, labelled and placed inside the cylinder for delivery by hand. During the year fourteen rats were sent to the Laboratory at County Hall and were examined for plague with negative results. (iii) Arrangements in the district for deratting ships, the methods used, and if done by a commercial contractor, the name of the contractor. (a) The burning of sulphur at the rate of 31bs per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a minimum period of 6 hours. This method is seldom used now in the Port of London. (b) The generation of hydrocyanic acid gas by various methods. For the destruction of rats a minimum'concentration of H.C.N, at the rate of 2 ozs per 1,000 cubic feet of space is required with a minimum of two hours exposure. (c) Sodium-fluoroacetate ("1080") and "Warfarin". The employment of "1080" as a rodenticide has been regularly used throughout the docks, for some time with highly satisfactory results. The prohibition on the use of "1080" and "1081" (Sodium Fluoroacetamide) except in ships and sewers, which was imposed in June 1965, has continued in force. A 16 substantial number of ships have been deratted by "1080" in preference to the use of cyanide resulting in a considerable saving of time and cost to the ship owner. (d) Trapping. This method is seldom used except as an expedient to eliminate isolated rats and/or to secure specimens for the laboratory. (e) Methyl Bromide. This is a very effective and lethal fumigant which has been used over a number of years in the Port as an insecticide, particularly in the dried fruit industry. It has considerable penetration powers and is not difficult to disperse after an operation. It is also possible to use this gas as a rodenticide and where there is an infestation of rodents and insects the combined problem can be solved with one operation. The following are the names of the firms approved for carrying out the deratting of ships:— London Fumigation Co. Ltd. Contra-Pest Service Ltd. Rentokil Laboratories Ltd. (iv) Progress in the Rat Proofing of Ships No Change. RODENT CONTROL MEASURES CARRIED OUT ON LIGHTERS In recent years there has been a steady decline in the number of lighters found to be infested with rats. The factors which have led to this decrease are as follows:— 1. Cleanliness and Hygiene Freedom from rats depends, in a large measure, upon proper maintenance and cleanliness of the lighter itself. A lighter should be systematically cleaned at frequent periods. Each time a hold is emptied, the dunnage or gratings should be stacked and the hold swept clean before the dunnage or gratings are laid again. 2. Harbourage This is divided into three types or classes - structural, incidental and temporary. Structural harbourage is that type which is integral with the lighter's structure. Incidental harbourage is that type located in or around equipment placed within the lighter. Temporary harbourage is that type existing in movable supplies, stores, dunnage etc. In other words, structural harbourage results from design and construction and is built into the lighter; incidental harbourage is introduced aboard the lighter and temporary harbourage results from the manner in which the lighter is operated. 3. Ral-prooling Rat-proofing includes the abolition of harbouring and nesting places, the isolation of the rat from a food supply and the prevention of rat communications between compartments. Rat-proofing may be accomplished in two ways — by protection, or by elimination, of partially or totally enclosed spaces. Protective methods apply generally to the rat-proofing of existing lighters which have numerous spaces available for rat harbourage and which can be protected from infestation only by making them rat-proof. Rat-proofing by elimination of enclosed spaces is applicable in the design and construction of new lighters. It is by far the most scientific and satisfactory method. The adoption and observance by the Lighterage Industry of the Port Health Authority recommendations relating to the rat proofing of lighters has, since its introduction in 1959, played a very important part in containing the rodent population to a minimal level. The methods of deratting employed throughout the year were:- Fumigants Rodenticides 1. Sulphur Dioxide Sodium-fluoroacetate (1080) 2. Methyl Bromide The method of treatment is determined by the condition and degree of infestation at the time of inspection.

Fattening of imported Portuguese oysters in the River Roach and Barling Hall Creek for re-export to France was continued during the year after being recommenced in 1967. To enable the Medical of Health to sign a 'Certificate of Purity' required by the French Authorities to accompany each consignment, the routine sampling procedure was continued throughout the year, all samples being sent to the Public Health Laboratory, Chelmsford for examination. During the year examinations were carried out on seven occasions and in each case the oysters were reported on as 'Satisfying the standards laid down by Worshipful Company of Fishmongers'. 'Certificates of Purity' were issued on eight occasions to accompany consignments .on exportation. Cockle Industry The cockle industry at Leigh-on-Sea continued throughout the year satisfactorily. Routine visits were made from time to time during the course of the year. The number of approved establishments remains at eight and the conditions of these were found to be of a satisfactory standard. One cockle establishment has been experimenting during the year with a suction type dredge to gather the cockles from the banks in the estuary as opposed to the conventional method of digging at low water. It is understood that this method has been successful. Routine sampling of the cockles after cleansing was carried out by Southend Public Health Department. No sickness was reported which could be attributed to the consumption of cockles from these establishments. On one occasion a 'Certificate of Purity' was requested for a consignment of cockles exported to France. The cockles were collected for Barling Hall Creek which is outside the 'prescribed area'. This consignment was sampled and examined at Chelmsford Public Health Laboratory and reported on as 'Bacteriologically satisfactory' and a certificate was issued accordingly. Oth er Shellfish During the year two samples of periwinkles were gathered from the foreshore at Thameshaven, this being outside the 'prescibed area'. Both samples were examined at Colindale Public Health Laboratory and were reported on as 'Coliform bacilli non-faecal not found'; 'Organisms of the Salmonella group not found'. As a result of the limited outbreak of food poisoning in Newcastle early in June, which was later attributed to the consumption of mussels infected by a bloom of dinoflagellates collected from the foreshores of Northumberland, consideration was immediately given to the possibility of a similar phenomenon occuring in the setuary of the River Thames. This was considered unlikely. However, the Fisheries Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at Burnham embarked on the sampling of shellfish. During the period of June to October, 161 samples were examined, of which only nine samples were derived from the District. The remainder were derived from adjacent areas. None of the samples contained demonstrable toxin. It was then considered that further research should be undertaken in 1969 during the considered favourable phenomenon period of April to October and that the Authority would be requested to participate. In October, the Ministry of Health notified the Authority that Danish mussels imported into this country around certain dates could have been infected with gymnodinium brevae, a toxic forming flagellate similar to the causative agent associated with the Northumberland infected mussels. A thorough check of all ships' manifests was made, but no Danish mussels were imported through the Port. 22 SECTION XV MEDICAL INSPECTION OF ALIENS AND COMMONWEALTH 1MIGRANTS 1.

Organisation of the work:- Aliens and Commonwealth Immigrants are examined by one of the above panel of doctors,at the request of an Immigration Officer. The majority of ships carrying immigrants are dealt with by the Boarding Medical Officers but a part-time Medical Inspector may be called in to deal with a particular ship. Since the inception of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act the larger passenger ships have been boarded at Ports of call prior to their arrival in London as noted below. 4.

Medical examination of aliens and Commonwealth immigrants is carried out on board ship. SECTION XVI MISCELLANEOUS Arrangements for the burial on shore of persons who have died on board ship from infectious disease. NO CHANGE CLEAN AIR ACT 1956 THE DARK SMOkE (PERMITTED PERIODS) (VESSELS) REGULATIONS, 1958 The number of reports of dark smoke emissions from vessels has continued to decrease. There were no legal proceedings instituted during the year although a number of informal visits were made by the Port Health Inspectors. 23 With the massive development and reconstruction schemes now taking place within areas of the Port Health District particularly at Tilbury, it would appear that certain other aspects of the Clean Air Act for which the Authority is responsible will assume growing importance. Particular reference is made to section 3 of the Act which requires compulsory notification of the proposed installation of certain new furnaces and the optional submission of plans for approval together with the requirements to satisfy the Authority on the matters prescribed in Section 10, in regard to the height of chimneys of new buildings and also recommendations contained in Ministry of Housing and Local Government circular on chimney heights. LOADING AND TRANSPORT OF REFUSE BY LIGHTERS The inspection of lighters engaged in this trade and routine visits to the loading wharves have been maintained during the year. There has not been any change in the number of wharves and docks used for the loading of refuse within the district. Spillage of refuse into the river still remains a problem. However, the improvements which have already commenced at one loading wharf, and those scheduled by the Greater London Council for some of the other wharves, should minimise this problem in the future. No prosecutions were instituted during the year. Minor infringements were immediately dealt with by direct personal representation HOUSEBOATS Benll eet and Canvey Island During 1968 the number of houseboats in the area decreased. This decline can be attributed firstly to the Authority's representations to Benfleet Urban District Council in 1967 and the consequent refusal by the local authority to issue further consents to moor, and secondly, to the extension of a refuse tip into the moorings area used by the majority of the boats. By the end of 1968 the moorings at Benfleet Creek West resembled more a breakers yard than a houseboat colony with nearly all the houseboats vacated and in the process of demolition. Of the 16 boats which had been refused consent to moor, 3 had been, or were going to be, removed to outside the Port of London Health Authority district; one had been moved to Queenborough (within the district) and the remainder were vacated and being dismantled. At Smallgains Creek, Canvey Island two boats, one in permanent occupation and the other used as a weekend boat, had been destroyed. At the end of 1968 in the Benfleet and Canvey Island area there were only 8 houseboats 4 in permanent occupation; 3 used as weekend boats and 1 used as a club-house by a local yacht club. The position with regard to these boats is kept under review and suitable action will be taken as and when circumstances prove necessary. DANGEROUS DRUGS During the year eight certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued under the Dangerous Drugs (No. 2) Regulations, 1964, Regulation 13 (2) of which is as follows:- (a) The master of a foreign ship which is in a port in Great Britain shall be authorised to procure such quantity of drugs and preparations as may be certified by the medical officer of health of the port health authority within whose jurisdiction the ship is or, in his absencejay the assistant medical officer of health, to be necessary for the equipment of the ship until it reaches its home port. (b) A person who supplies a drug or preparation in accordance with a certificate given under this paragraph shall retain the certificate and mark it with the date on which the drug or preparation was supplied and keep it on his premises so as to be at all times available for inspection. 24 FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS 1960/62 During the early part of each year the Board of Trade carry out a survey of passenger-carrying launches on the River Thames. The operators take this opportunity to make repairs, to renew fittings and to throughly clean and repaint the launches. Fresh water storage tanks are cleaned and, together with the distribution systems, are chlorinated prior to use. Throughout the season the operators endeavour to maintain the high standard attained at the time of the annual refit. Inspections of these craft are carried out regularly during the season. The standard of food hygiene, both on the launches and in the catering establishments supplying them with food, continues to be highly satisfactory. The service provided by a thirty-five year old paddle steamer to the estuary towns has been discontinued. In the latter part of the year a passenger carrying catamaran arrived on the river. This craft will commence operating in the summer of 1969. During the year 88 inspections under the Regulatipns were carried out. Minor infringements were corrected at the time of the visit. CYANIDE INCIDENT AT NO. 6, KING GEORGE V DOCK An accident occurred during the loading of drums of sodium cyanide into a ship's hold from a lighter. Fourteen drums fell into a second lighter loaded with crated machinery lying astern of the ship and two drums fell into the dock after bouncing off a nearby dolphin. A number of the drums which fell into the lighter burst on impact, spilling their contents over the crates and it was assumed that the two which fell into the dock were also fractured, as they sank after floating for some time. Although this was an industrial rather than a public health matter (except inasmuch as the dock water was affected), the Public Analyst was immediately consulted and as a result the Authority were able to re-assure all those concerned that although sodium cyanide is an extremely dangerous poison if ingested, no chemical reaction takes place by the addition of water (as opposed to an acid which will produce H.C.N. gas). The Port of London Authority police and the fire brigade, in full protective clothing, took charge of safety operations and the lighter was placed at a lay-by berth, sheeted over, and danger notices posted by day with red lamps at night. The method for the subsequent decontamination of the lighter and contents was agreed upon at a meeting called by the P.L.A. Police and attended by this Authority's Deputy Medical Officer and a Senior Port Health Inspector, together with chemists from the shippers of the cyanide. The chemists duly took charge of the cleansing operation and the disposal of the loose collected cyanide powder. An Inspector of this Authority was present at various stages, particularly when the crates of machinery were brushed down and then sheeted over on road transport for conveyance back to the factory for subsequent disposal. A Port of London Authority diver sent down at the berth failed to locate the two lost drums. Five samples of the dock water were taken by the P.L.A. Engineer's Department, the highest sample contained cyanide to the extent of 1.7 parts per million. With the constant movement of water and subsequent dilution, this was not considered a hazard. INCIDENTS INVOLVING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL During 1968, there was one incident involving radioactive material. A box which contained a cigarette counting machine, one of five delivered to the dock for export, had been damaged during handling. The machine incorporated a small radioactive component of six micro-curies. The Medical Officer of Health, therefore, was notified of the incident by the Port of London Authority's Traffic Officer in accordance with the Port of London Authority Standing Instructions. The machine togther with the radioactive component had not suffered any apparent damage, but it was returned to the manufacturers for examination. DOCK WORKERS' AMENITY BLOCKS Part II of the Docks and "Harbours Act, 1966, which provides for defined welfare amenities in all major ports, came into operation on the 1st April. The Port of London Authority, as a result of recommendations of the Devlin Committee in 1965, had however already drawn up plans and had commenced a phased programme of construction following consultation with employers and the trade unions. 25 The first of these amenity blocks for dock workers was completed in March near 'B' Berth, Royal Victoria Dock and caters for 250 men. The block incorporates showers, washing facilities toilets, locker room with individual lockers and a clothes drying room. Canteen facilities are also available. It is expected that the facilities so readily available will assist the personal cleanliness of dock workers engaged in the general handling of foodstuffs. The facilities will also enable workers engaged in handling dirty cargoes to clean up before going home. FIRST AID TRAINING OF LAI NCH CREWS The Authority have previously agreed to certain medical functions being assigned to the Boarding Medical Officer on watch on the Gravesend Station under the Port of London Combined Accident Procedure (POLACAP), for dealing with major accidents within the Port. The 'Humphrey Morris' with a doctor on board will normally proceed to a position in the Lower River district close to an accident and render medical assistance. The 'Victor Allcard' and 'Alfred Roach' will also proceed to an accident should they be within reasonable distance at the time to search for and rescue casualties in the River. Several exercises have been carried out. In order that they might play a fuller part in this work it was decided that all the launch crews should receive first aid instruction from a St. john Ambulance Association Instructor. In February, the launch crews completed a course of instruction and, following an examination, seven members were awarded the St. John Ambulance Association First Aid Certificate which is renewable every three years. The knowledge and experience obtained from the course has since been of additional practical use in the landing of sick and injured seamen and passengers from inward and outward bound vessels associated with statutory duties under the Public Health (Ships) Regulations 1966 and with the 'unofficial' but very worthwhile work of 'riverborne ambulancemen'. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ALT & ASSOCIATED ACTS Mr. G.S. Wiggins M.R.C.V.S. Veterinary Officer for the City of London, has submitted the following report:— Under the terms of the London Government Act 1963, the Corporation of London is the authority for the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act 1950, in respect of the importation of animals, for the whole of Greater London. Diseases of Animals Act — Importations Numerous visits were made to London Airport (Heathrow) during the year in connection with the illegal entry of animals into this country. One visit was made to King George V Dock for the same reason. In all 75 notices were served on owners directing 57 dogs and 28 cats into quarantine. Also, 3 notices were served directing imported animals from one port to anotherfor re-exportation. Post mortem examinations were carried out on 4 hares and 2 Rhesus monkeys which were dead on arrival at the airport and reports submitted to the airlines concerned. In two instances R.S.P.C.A. assistants at Heathrow were bitten whilst handling dogs in transhipment. In both cases the person concerned received hospital treatment and, as a precautionary measure, reports were obtained from the veterinary services of the importing countries to ascertain that the animals had remained healthy for the usual 10 day period. Through your Medical Officer of Health, the London Borough of Hillingdon arranged for a course of vaccination against rabies to be carried out for the staff of the R.S.P.C.A. Hostel and your Veterinary Officers. At the present time blood samples from the recipients are being tested to see if the vaccination has been succesful. Importation of Pops & Cats Order 1928 In February a yacht was berthed at Tower Pier with several dogs on board. The reason for this was that the owners wished to avoid quarantine restrictions which would have been imposed hadthe animals been landed. During their stay, until 20th August, a careful watch was kept on the vessel and the terms and conditions of the above Order were strictly adhered to. In April it was reported that a dog had escaped from the m.v. 'Stortbeker', berthed at Imperial Wharf, Greenwich. The animal had jumped from the vessel into the river and was not recovered. A report was received from the Port of London Authority Police in May that a dog had been seen running through some timber sheds at Montague Meyers Timber Wharf, Millwall Dock. The dog was later captured and returned to the m.v. 'Troyberg', from which it had escaped. A similar case occured in August of a dog escaping from the m.v. 'Adeny', berthed at Surrey Commercial Dock. The animal was free for 2 days before being found and returned to the vessel. 26 In each of the above instances warning letters were addressed to the Master of the vessels concerned and, in the case of the m.v. 'Adeny', a warning letter was also sent to the owner of the dog who was a member of the crew. Letters were also sent to the Agents for the 'Adeny' and 'Troyberg' requesting them to bring the Order to the notice of Masters of all vessels for whom they act. In September proceedings were instituted against an owner for bringing a cat into this country in contravention of the above Order. The defendant pleaded guilty and was fined £10 with 5 guineas costs. Rabies Order 1938 Under the terms of the above Order two notices were served on owners of a dog and cat requiring them to detain and isolate their animals. In the case of the cat the notice was withdrawn after the ten day period. The dog, which was in a quarantine kennel, was destroyed at the owners request. Animals (Sea Transport) Order 1930 and Horses (Sea Transport) Order 1952 Under the terms of the above Orders visits were made to docks in connection with the exportation of animals to various countries. The animals comprised 14 horses, 20 cattle, 23 pigs and 5 sheep and the reasons for export were for breeding purposes except in two cases which were for exhibition purposes. Export Certificates 152 health certificates were issued to 22 firms, enabling them to export various commodities. Also health certificates were issued for 2 dogs, 3 pigs and 12 canaries. Details of visits and actions taken in connection with the under-mentioned Acts and Orders may be found in this Authority's annual report for the City of London. Psittacosis or Ornithosis Order 1953 Foot and Mouth Disease (including Foot & Mouth Disease (Imported Meat) Order 1968 Anthrax Order 1938 Riding Establishments Act 1964 Pet Animals Act 1951 Animal Boarding Establishment Act 1963 Performing Animals (Regulation)Act 1925 Live Poultry (Restrictions) Order 1957 Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968". THE LORD MAYOR S PROCESSION The theme of this years Lord Mayor's Pageant was 'London River - Sea Highway to the World'. It comprised 23 floats representing British Shipping companies and organisations and institutions connected with shipping. 27 The Corporation of London as the Port Health Authority for the Port of London was represented by a float in the form of one of the Authority's launches on which was depicted four examples of the Port Health Authority's many functions. The displays, with suitable backgrounds, showed the Quarantine Health Control applied to inward vessels; the inspection of imported foodstuffs, including meat; hygiene on ships; and rodent and insect control on ships andin dock storage premises. The personnel manning the float were officers directly engaged in the function displayed. FOOD INSPECTION The total amount of foodstuffs detained for examination and either condemned as unfit for human consumption and destroyed or otherwise disposed of under guarantee and suDervision was 1583 tons 1 cwt. 0 qrs. 27 lbs.

BANANA WASTE Since 1965 there has been a gradual change in the method of shipping bananas from Jamaica. In effect bananas have been containerised. Before 1965, bananas were carried by the conventional method, i.e. on the stems. In that year, 1,470 tons of banana waste were surrendered to the Port Health Authority for destruction. This represented 2.03 per cent of the total tonnage carried. Much of this wastage resulted from Santa Marta Stem End Rot. This rot spreads from the banana stem through the ends of the individual fingers causing them to drop off. By removing the hands from the stems this decay is arrested. In 1966, in Jamaica, the banana producers experimented by cutting sound hands of bananas from the stems and packing them in stout cardboard cartons for carriage by sea. The experiment continued at an increasing scale throughout 1967, and in 1968 all bananas landed in the Port of London were packed in cartons. During 1968, 51 cargoes comprising 72,036 tons of Jamaican bananas were discharged at the Royal Albert Dock. Of this tonnage only 54 tons of waste were surrendered for destruction. This represents 0.075 per cent wastage as compared with 2.03 per cent in 1965. The success of the experiment has been twofold. Firstly, a significant saving in hold space; secondly, and most important, a considerable reduction in the amount of banana waste. SEABORNE CONTAINER TRAFFIC The importation of goods, including foodstuffs, in containers into the Port of London increased dramatically during 1968. In addition to the established services from Holland and Sweden, using the 'roll-on roll-off' system of discharge (through specially constructed stern door vessels), 'lift-on lift-off' container services were started on the new Container Terminals forming part of the Tilbury Dock Extension. Short Sea Container Trades No. 43 Berth was the first Container Terminal to come into operation in the Port of London equipped with lifting gear to handle only ISO (International Standard Organisation) Containers. It came into operation on the 15th January with a single ship on service and became the London terminal for the short sea traders. Trade justified the running of a second vessel on the service 42 in March, and in May a third ship came into operation. This service was then maintained throughout the rest of 1968, the ships. generally,arriving, discharging, reloading and sailing in one day, to and from near Continental ports. In the middle of May another company commenced running to this same berth from Finland with two ships engaged on a regular service. In November, yet another line started a further trade with one ship on a weekly trade from East Germany. From the 15th January until the end of the year there were 323 arrivals to the berth to discharge and of the 5,778 containers landed 23% i.e. 1,337 contained foodstuffs. By the end of the year these small container ships were arriving at the rate of 10 a week, with further expansion planned for 1969. Ocean Container Trades Prior to 1968, conventional ocean going cargo ships adapted to carry containers have been discharging containered cargoes in London only to a limited extent. This practice was extended during the year with the introduction of the first of the purpose built ocean going 'container ships'. On the 12th June a new Ocean Container Terminal commenced operations at 40 Berth Tilbury Dock. Up to the end of the year this berth handled 29 arrivals. The vessels which were of 32,000 Displacement Tons and capable of carrying over 1,000 containers each, were part discharged and reloaded and a turn-round of 12 hours was commonplace. Their fast passage together with a quick turn-round in port enabled a weekly service from America to Continental Ports and Tilbury to be maintained by three ships. In the seven months that they were operating in 1968 to 40 Berth they landed some 4,500 containers, of these 257 contained foodstuffs, including refrigerated meat, fish and other perishable commodities. General The control of imported foodstuffs arriving in this country by container is now an important and time consuming function carried out by the dock Inspectors responsible for the terminals. Daily calls are essential to the berths concerned,and very often two or three calls a day become necessary for the examination of containerised foodstuffs to avoid delays to the containers awaiting delivery. Further new container terminals will be operating at Tilbury Dock during 1969 including 39 Berth where Overseas Containers Ltd., commence their Australian service in May. They plan to handle approximately 2,500 20ft. ISO Containers in a 48 hour period. If this is to be accomplished delays, including delays for examination, must be kept to a minimum. 43 SUMMARY OF SHIPPING ARRIVALS INTO TILBURY 1968 DISCHARGING I.S.O. CONTAINERS (MAJOR OPERATORS).

Nineteen Samples of Feeding Stuffs were submitted to the Agricultural Analyst. No sample of fertiliser was sent. Sixteen of the samples were found to be within the limits of variation permissible under the regulations. Four samples contained excess protein and one sample contained insufficient fibre. On each occasion the Merchant was informed of the discrepancy and warned that he must ensure that future feeding stuffs were kept within the limits of the permitted variation. However, as the discrepancies were small and not to the prejudice of the purchaser, further action was considered unnecessary. STUDENTS AND VISITORS Student Public Health Inspectors Nine student public health inspectors were employed by the Authority. One completed the the four year course and obtained the Diploma of the Public Health Inspectors Education Board and subsequently was appointed as Port Health Inspector with the Authority. 98 student public health inspectors from other local authorities and technical colleges received instruction in port health work. Visitors A considerable number of doctors and public health inspectors from home and foreign government departments and local authorities and students from institutes of health education visited the port during the year. The overseas countries sending visitors included Iraq, Singapore, Bulgaria, Iran, Egypt, Sierre Leone, South Africa, Sweden, West Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Tonga and Ethiopia.
