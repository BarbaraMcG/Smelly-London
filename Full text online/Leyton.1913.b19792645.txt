Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report on the Health and General Sanitary circumstances of the District for the year 1913. The year on the whole has been a favourable one from a health point of view. No serious Epidemic disease has obtained a hold in our midst. In the body of the Report the fact is referred to that Leyton has suffered far less severely than its surrounding neighbours from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. That the Council have made no provision for the Hospital treatment of Small Pox, in spite of my earnest appeals, causes me grave anxiety. 1 sincerely hope they will see their way to remedy this defect before it is too late. Again I have to thank all the Members and Officials for their invariable courtesy and assistance. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. FRANCIS TAYLOR. Leyton Urban District Council. ANNUAL HEALTH REPORT FOR 1913, BY J. FRANCIS TAYLOR, M.R.C.S.Eng., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health. The general characteristics of the District and of its inhabitants having been outlined in previous reports, it is unnecessary to repeat them here. ASSESSABLE AND RATEABLE VALUE. The present assessable value for general district purposes is £512,614 17s., and a rate of 1d. in the produces £1,930. For poor rate purposes the rateable value is £542,891, and 1d. rate produces £.2,083. AREA, INHABITED HOUSES, POPULATION. The district has a total area of 2,594 acres; at the end of May it contained 23,523 houses, of which number 545 were uninhabited. The census population divided among the inhabited houses gave an average of 5.63 persons per house. On this basis our population at the middle of the year totals 129,366 persons. The Registrar.General.s estimate is 130,922. As pointed out in last year.s report the Registrar.General assumes that we continue to increase in the same ratio as we did during the last intercensal period, but as building operations are constantly diminishing owing to nearly all the available land being built upon, his figures must necessarily be too high. The number of new houses erected in the district during the year 1913 was only 97. 3 But as the number of houses occupied by two or more families is steadily increasing, the average number of persons per house will be found to be greater at the next Census than at the last. The demand for houses in Leyton may be gauged from the return of uninhabited houses, these, which in 1911 numbered 1,213, have now dropped to 545. The above facts indicate some of the difficulties encountered in attempting to arrive at an estimate of the population, the only remedy for which is a more frequent Census. For the purposes of this year.s report I am taking 129,366 to be our population, and by doing so I am somewhat prejudicing our death returns when compared with other districts which accept the Registrar.General.s estimate. The following table shows the constitution of the various wards into which Leyton is divided:— Ward. Area in Acres. Number of Houses. Persons per Acre. Number of inhabited Houses. Population. Leyton 432 1800 22.9 1763 9926 Lea Bridge 521 3292 35.1 3247 18281 Forest 599 3249 29.7 3161 17796 Central 233 4256 100.6 4162 23432 Leytonstone 326 2954 49.5 2869 16152 Harrow Green 139 1941 75.9 1874 10551 Grove Green 121 1859 83.9 1804 10156 Cann Hall 135 2517 103.6 2484 13985 Wanstead Slip 88 1655 103.3 1614 9087 2594 23523 49.9 22978 129366 BIRTHS. During the year 2,904 births were registered, giving a birthrate of 22.4 per 1,000 of the population. Of these, 1,442 were males and 1,462 females. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 23.9; for the 96 Great Towns, 25.1; and for London, 24.5. Births.—1913. Year 1913. Names of Localities—Wards. Totals. Leyton. Lea Bridge. Central.

One male born in 1907. Registered August, 1913. 9 10 Our birth.rate for 1907 was 26.6 per 1,000 of population. „ „ 1908 „ 25.3 „ „ 1909 „ 24.6 „ „ 1910 „ 24.4 „ „ 1911 „ 23.5 „ „ 1912 „ 22.1 „ „ 1913 ,, 22.4 „ „ The birth.rate which it will thus be seen has been diminishing year by year is .3 per 1,000 of the population higher than last year. Whether we have arrived at the lowest point or not remains to be seen. The number of illegitimate births was 51, of these 27 were males and 24 females. Our illegitimate birth.rate is therefore .39 per 1,000 of the population. DEATHS. As in last year.s returns the transferable deaths, those of residents of Leyton who have died in other districts, are included in the present report. The inhabitants of Leyton who died during the year 1913 numbered 1,336. Of these 646 were males and 690 females. Our death.rate is thus, approximately, 10.3 per 1,000 of the population. In 1912 the death.rate was 10.6 per 1,000 of the population. The death.rate for England and Wales in 1913 was 13.7; for the 96 Great Towns, 14.3; and for London, 14.2. 11 The table below shows the number of deaths which occurred from certain specified causes for the past five years:— 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 Diarrhœal Diseases 36 21 126 31 58 Measles 29 16 76 12 31 Pneumonia (all forms) 38 67 101 111 117 Tubercular Diseases 135 133 171 159 134 Cancer 83 87 99 93 97 Enteric Fever 3 2 5 4 0 Whooping Cough 33 16 20 38 18 Diphtheria 27 22 14 22 11 Scarlet Fever 8 16 7 4 0 Influenza 11 15 11 9 9 Puerperal Fever 6 3 2 5 4 Premature Births, Congenital Debility, &c. 130 116 124 100 108 Nephritis and Bright.s Disease 62 40 43 53 48 Suicides 8 7 3 4 12 It will be noted that no deaths occurred from Scarlet and Enteric Fevers, while only 11 deaths occurred from Diphtheria. ZYMOTIC DEATH.RATE. The deaths which occurred during the year from the seven principal Zymotic diseases were distributed among those diseases as follows:—Measles, 31; Scarlet Fever, 0; Diphtheria, 11; Whooping Cough, 18; Enteric Fever, 0; Diarrhoea and Enteritis under two years of age, 44. In 1906 our Zymotic death.rate was 2.3 per 1,000 of the population. „ 1907 „ „ „ „ 1.7 „ „ „ 1908 „ „ „ „ .9 „ „ „ 1909 „ „ „ „ .97 „ „ „ 1910 „ „ „ „ .65 „ „ „ 1911 „ „ „ „ 1.84 „ „ „ 1912. „ „ „ „ .83 „ „ „ 1913 „ „ „ „ .8 „ „ 12 The Zymotic death.rate for London was 1.42. The Registrar.General has ceased to calculate the Zymotic death.rate as a whole, but he gives the rate for each disease separately. I am therefore unable to compare our Zymotic death. rate with those of England and Wales, and the 96 Great Towns. INFANTILE DEATH.RATE. The infantile mortality rate, i.e., the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 83.3. In 1906 our infantile mortality rate was 114.5 „ 1907 „ „ „ „ 86.5 „ 1908 „ „ „ „ 78.8 „ 1909 „ „ „ „ 81.9 ,, 1910 „ „ „ „ 63.4 „ 1911 „ „ „ „ 111.6 „ 1912 „ „ „ „ 79.7 „ 1913 „ „ „ „ 83.3 On reference to the tables it will be seen that of the 242 deaths which occurred in infants under one year of age, 128, or 52 per cent., were due to ante.natal causes. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 109 „ „ „ „ London „ 105 „ „ „ „ the 96 Great Towns „ 117 There were 8 deaths of illegitimate children under 1 year of age, viz. : 1 male and 7 females. SMALL.POX. One notification of this disease was received during the year, but the case proved to be one of Chicken.pox. As pointed out in last year.s Annual Report our agreement with the Metropolitan Asylums Board terminated in March, and since that time we have been without any Hospital accommodation for cases of this disease. 13 The proposed arrangement with West Ham fell through, and negotiations were opened with a view to becoming a Constituent Authority of the South Mimms Hospital. The Public Health Sub.Committee on December 2nd deputed its Chairman and the Medical Officer of Health to visit the Hospital and report to them. The following is a copy of the report:— SOUTH MIMMS HOSPITAL. On Friday last I accompanied our Chairman on a visit to the Combined Authorities. Small.pox Hospital at South Mimms. We did the journey in a motor.car in about an hour, allowing for a slight delay caused by our overshooting the mark through not knowing the road. I had written to the Medical Superintendent a day or two previously announcing our visit, but as he was away for a week we were received by his deputy, Dr. Davies. Dr. Davies showed us round the various blocks, which were of the corrugated iron type, very similar to our own Isolation Hospital. These blocks accommodate 250 patients. Parts of them are being used for cases of Tuberculosis, of which there are now 150. The Tuberculosis patients in the event of an epidemic of Small.pox would be discharged, and there is further plenty of space in the grounds for the erection of additional buildings or tents. The Hospital has its own sewage disposal plant, laundry, disinfectors, etc. The buildings are situated in an airy open locality remote from other dwellings. The Chairman and I consider that the Council would be making suitable provision against "Small.pox" by becoming a Constituent Authority of this Hospital. J. FRANCIS TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. 9th December, 1913. 14 The Public Health Committee, however, refused to take any further steps, and the Council by a bare majority supported them. Their reasons for doing so being that they did not see their way to incur an annual expenditure of something like £500 to insure against a contingency thev did not think likely to arise. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee did his best to convince them they were mistaken. The Medical Officer of Health.s attitude may be best judged from his previous reports. It is to be feared that nothing but the experience of an epidemic of this disease and its concomitant horrors will bring conviction to the minds of a large section of the public. It may be once again pointed out that should a case of Smallpox be imported into our midst, in the absence of any Hospital being available to which it can be sent, the case must be allowed to remain at home to infect the neighbourhood, and so an epidemic will be started, the results of which cannot be foreseen. If everyone were efficiently vaccinated the necessity for providing Hospital accommodation would not arise. Objectors to vaccination should be among the strongest supporters of Hospital segregation. VACCINATION RETURNS. The following are the details received from the Vaccination Officer as to infant Vaccination for the past 5½ years:— Number of Births. Vaccinated. Certificates of Insusceptibility. Exemptions Died Unvaccinated under 1 year. 1907 3190 2089 9 188 203 1908 3071 1756 12 487 199 1909 2979 1396 12 556 173 1910 3011 1241 10 730 140 1911 2931 976 11 658 180 1912 2797 1156 5 1069 154 .1913 1461 575 6 570 81 .January 1st to June 30th, 15 ENTERIC FEVER. 11 cases were notified, of which number 3 were subsequently proved to have been errors in diagnosis. No deaths occurred. Our death.rate from Enteric Fever was .00 per 1,000 of the population; that of England and Wales, .04; and of the 96 Great Towns, .04; and of London, .02. Every case was visited, usually by the Medical Officer of Health, and in addition to giving suitable advice, etc., endeavour was made to trace the cause of the infection, with what success may be gleaned from the table given below. This table shows conclusively that Leyton.s sanitary condition, judged by the standard of Enteric Fever incidence, is satisfactory. Case. Sex. Age. Yrs. Where Treated. Result. Remarks. 1 M. 21 West Ham Infirmary Recovered Waiter on 1st class saloon G.E.R. Liverpool Street to Harwich.

DIPHTHERIA. 147 cases were notified, against 155 in 1912. 11 deaths occurred, a case.fatality of 7.5 per cent. In 1907 the case.fatality was 14.7 per cent. „ 1908 „ „ 8.2 „ 1909 „ „ 13.4 „ 1910 „ „ 13.2 „ 1911 8.0 „ „ 1912 „ „ 142 „ „ 1913 „ „ 7.5 „ Our death.rate from Diphtheria for the year 1913 was .09 per 1,000 of the population; that of England and Wales, .12; of the 96 Great Towns, .13; and of London, 09. PUERPERAL FEVER. 11 cases of this disease were notified, and four deaths occurred; a case.fatality of 36.4 per cent. The fatality per cent. of the total births is .14. Four cases occurred in the practice of midwives. The County is the authority for the administration of the Midwives Act, and the County Medical Officer of Health has been promptly notified of all cases coming under his jurisdiction. Chart showing Notifications of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria received each week during 1913. SCARLET FEVER in Black. DIPHTHERIA in Red. 17 Disinfection of premises and clothing has been systematically carried out. As I have previously stated, I have good reason for believing that only a proportion of the cases of Puerperal Fever which occur are notified to the Medical Officer of Health. ATTACK RATE PER 1,000 OF THE POPULATION Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. Puerperal Fever. East Ham 386 1.87 0.19 0.06 LEYTON 2.68 1.15 0.08 0.08 Walthamstow 3.54 2.48 0.09 0.08 Ilford 291 1.55 0.04 0.05 Barking 4.17 1.10 0.15 0.12 West Ham 4.10 1.48 0.25 0.04 Willesden 3.24 1.49 0.11 0.07 Tottenham 421 1.92 0.08 0.04 Edmonton 6.82 1.86 0.16 0.04 Enfield 2.84 1.31 0.03 0.09 Acton 1.28 1.88 0.07 0.07 Croydon 2.76 2.66 0.20 0.03 Wimbledon 2.61 2.33 0.14 0.04 Ealing 5.14 0.83 0.08 — London 3.89 1.70 017 0.08 From the above it will be seen that of the 15 towns quoted, with one exception—Acton—Ley ton had the lowest Scarlet Fever attack rate; and also that Leyton's Diphtheria attack rate was, with the exception of Barking, the lowest. MFASLES. This disease was the cause of 31 deaths during the year, against 12 in 1912. Our death.rate from Measles, therefore, was .24 per 1,000 of the population; that of England and Wales, .28; of the 96 Great Towns, .24; and of London, .34. 18 The 31 deaths were distributed throughout the year as follows:— Jan. Feb. Mar. April May June July Au£. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. 10 7 2 5 5 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 All of the deaths occurred in children under five years of age, i.e., in children who do not attend school. I received from the school teachers information in respect of 617 cases of Measles. The Health Visitor paid 688 visits to these cases, and gave the parents suitable advice, especially as to the necessity for seeking medical attention. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough caused 18 deaths, against 38 in 1912. 4 of these deaths occurred in children under one year of age, 7 in those between one and two years, 6 in those of two and under five years, and 1 twenty-nine years (female). Our death-rate from Whooping Cough was .14 per 1,000 of the population; that of England and Wales being '14; of the 96 Great Towns, .17; and of London, .17. DIARRHœA AND ENTERITIS. Diarrhoea and Enteritis caused 58 deaths, 38 of which were of infants under one year of age. Our death-rate from Diarrhoea and Enteritis under two years was 15.15 per 1,000 births; that of England and Wales 23.41; of the 96 Great Towns, 29.33; and of London, 27.2. 19 In 1903 these diseases caused the deaths of 35 children under 5 years of age. „ 1904 „ „ „ 180 „ „ 1905 „ „ „ „ 52 „ 1906 „ „ „ „ 116 „ 1907 „ „ „ „ 37 „ 1908 „ „ „ „ 36 „ 1909 „ „ „ „ 34 „ „ „ 1910 „ „ „ „ 16 „ 1911 „ „ „ 110 „ „ „ 1912 „ „ „ „25 „ „ „ 1913 „ „ „ „ 47 „ „ CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS, ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS AND ACUTE POLIOENCEPHALITIS. Six cases of Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis, and 2 cases of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis have been notified during the year. The following is a copy of a special report sent to the Local Government Board in answer to a request from them for such information:— POLIOMYELITIS. Six cases of Poliomyelitis have been notified to me since August 1st, 1913. Five of these six were notified from the following hospitals:—London Hospital, 1; West Ham Hospital, 2; Queen's Hospital, Hackney Road, 1; Great Ormond Street Hospital, 1; and 1 was notified by a Leytonstone practitioner. Each case was visited by me, and I found in every instance that a considerable time had elapsed since the first onset of the disease, in one case 4 months; that there were many other children in the families, in two cases 4 and 5 respectively ; that no isolation had been practised; that the disease had in no instance spread to the other children; that no intercourse between the affected children was traceable; and that the cases were distributed in parts of the district remote from one another. 20 Under the above circumstances I think myself justified in regarding each case as a sporadic form of the disease. Isolation was advised and disinfection offered, but the latter was refused, and I fear the isolation carried out was of a very comparative character. I did not consider verification of the diagnosis necessary as the histories of the symptoms were fairly typical and paralysis was present in all the cases. However, should bacteriological confirmation have been indicated specimens of spinal fluid, etc., could have been sent to Dr. Thresh, with whom the Council have an arrangement for such work. One case was treated as an in-patient at Great Ormond Street Hospital for one month. The others were treated as outpatients. J. F. TAYLOR, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Leyton, 1st January, 1914. I visited all the cases of Poliomyelitis on April 15th, 1914, to ascertain how many of them were still paralysed. 1 found that more or less paralysis was permanent in all the cases but one, that of a boy 4 years old, and he was stone deaf. The mother dated the deafness from the illness. He had had no Otorrhœa nor any symptoms of ear disease. Both of the cases of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis died in hospital. TUBERCULOSIS. 134 deaths occurred from all forms of Tuberculosis, which represents a death-rate of 1.04 per 1,000 of the population. The number of deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis was 106, and the death-rate per 1,000 of the population, .8. On February 1st the Order of the Local Government Board, "Tuberculosis Regulations, 1912," came into force. 21 Under these regulations I have received from that date to December 31st notifications of 288 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 195 of other forms of Tuberculosis. All these cases have been periodically visited about once in three months by the Health Visitor, and verbal and written instructions have been given as to the necessary precautions to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease. Enquiries have also been made as to any other cases of suspicious illness among other inhabitants of the house, and advice to seek medical assistance has been offered; also cases have been referred to the Tuberculosis Officer, through the Medical Officer of Health. Sanitary conditions have been enquired into, and defects found to exist have been remedied. Disinfectants have been supplied, and disinfection of premises carried out in cases of death or where sufferers from the disease have vacated their dwellings. Some spit flasks have been supplied, and bacteriological examination of sputum has been undertaken at the request of the patients' Medical Attendants. Particulars of the above work have been recorded on cards, and the cards are kept in the Public Health Department, where they are always available for reference. The Tuberculosis Dispensary at Leyton continues to be held at the Town Hall, but a house has been taken for the purpose close to Leyton (G.E.R.) Station, to which premises the Dispensary will be transferred early in the year 1914. The new premises are within easy distance of the Town Hall. Dr. Pitt, the Tuberculosis Officer, has found it necessary to increase the days of attendance to two per week. He now attends on Mondays, 3 to 6 p.m., and Thursdays, 6 to 8 p.m. With a view to prevent overlapping between the officers appointed by the Local and County Authorities the following arrangements have been made:— 22 Dr. Pitt has been appointed by the Leyton Council Assistant Medical Officer of Health for Tuberculosis purposes at a nominal salary of ten guineas per annum. In this capacity he visits patients as well as in his capacity of Tuberculosis Officer. Thus unnecessary visiting by the Medical Officer of Health, as well as by the Tuberculosis Officer, is avoided. The Medical Officer of Health transmits a list of the notifications he has received every Monday morning to the Tuberculosis Officer, who visits or causes the cases to be visited. If he finds any work is needed in connection with a case which properly falls to the duty of the Local Authority such as disinfection, remedying of sanitary defects, &c., he informs the Medical Officer of Health, who promptly has the work carried out. Notifications of cases of Phthisis and other forms of Tuberculosis have been received from the Institutions set forth on the opposite page. 23  Pulmonary. Other forms. Total.

As a rule the month was of a mild, open character, the temperature frequently mounting to 50° and upwards. There were, however, some sharp frosts, the severest on the 13th and 14th, when there were many records below 20°. For the midwinter month thunderstorms were fairly numerous, noted in many places on the 15th, 19th, 20th and 31st, frequently with hail or snow. Inland fogs were a little more frequent than in several previous Januarys. On the East coast of Britain fog was reported nearly every day; on the Western coasts it was much less frequent; and along the English channel rarely mentioned. Mean temperatures: Highest, 46.l°; lowest, 35.9°. Rainfall at Leyton, 2.48 inches. February.—Cloudy and dry. One foggy week. As a general rule temperature was maintained within moderate limits, and for the whole month the mean results were nearly everywhere above the normal—by as much as 3° at Yarmouth. Between the 4th and the 14th, afternoon readings of 55° and upwards occurred in many localities. Generally the frosts registered were of the slightest, but on the mornings of the 14th and 23rd a sharp one visited many districts. The afternoon of the 20th was the coldest of the month, temperature not passing above 35° at a number of stations, 33° at Buxton and Sheepstor. Fog was unusually prevalent inland and on the coasts (and also on the Continent) from the 10th to the 15th; dense to very dense in several localities. In 28 London on the 15th the fog was lifted above the housetops, a dense canopy which shut out the daylight completely, so that in the streets below there was intense darkness during the day. Mean temperatures : Highest, 46.7°; lowest, 35.6°. Rainfall at Leyton, .67 inch. March.—Rough and wet. The temperature of the month, which was generally above the normal, and especially so over Eastern and South-Eastern England, was remarkable for its general uniformity. The early morning of the 18th was marked by a sharp frost over a wide area. The earth tremor was felt at Isleworth, Middlesex, at about 5 p.m. on the 22nd. A thunderstorm was then in progress. There was a decided falling-off in the records of fog, both inland and on the coasts. Along the English Channel there were hardly any references to fog. Mean temperatures : Highest, 52.0°; lowest, 38'3°. Rainfall at Leyton, 1.98 inches. April.—Dull and wet. During the greater portion of the month the temperature was fairly uniform all over the kingdom, and the daily range was small. The few exceptions were rather striking. On the 11th and 12th the day maxima were unusually low, at numerous stations below 40°. This was succeeded by a sharp frost in the night of the 12th. In the last week the day readings rose appreciably above the normal, the 23rd, 24th, 27th and 29th having a 29 considerable number of maxima above 65°, Isleworth, Wisley, Woking and Ross touching 69°, Wimbledon, Canterbury and Margate 70°. Fogs showed a further diminution, both inland and at sea, being seldom noted on the South Coast of England. Mean temperatures: Highest, 55.4°; lowest, 38.9 Rainfall at Leyton, 2.22 inches. May.—A very variable month. Until about the 22nd, cold weather ruled, notably round the 6th and 7th, when low temperatures were common; frost in many localities. Suddenly unusual heat set in, and from the 25th to the 30th day readings of 80° and upwards were numerous over England, 84° on the 26th and 27th at some London stations. With the heat came more or less severe thunderstorms to nearly all parts of England, from the 26th to the 31st, resulting in a number of casualties. But there were singularly few heavy rain and hail falls, generally less than A inch. At Warlingham, on the 27th, there was a sudden drop of 13° in the temperature, on the breaking of a thunderstorm. The same storm at Southend was noted as the heaviest for ten years, the hailstones being l¼in. in diameter. There was a marked increase in the frequency of coastal fogs, in the East during the first fortnight, and in the South and West during the very warm weather at the end of the month, often dense, and leading to numerous casualties. Mean temperatures: Highest, 66 6°; lowest, 45.3°. Rainfall at Leyton, 1.25 inches. 30 June.—A variable month. Dry in England. Over the Eastern half of the Kingdom the mean temperature for the month was rather above the normal, while the Western districts returned a deficiency—about 2° in Ireland. As a general rule the days were very cool. There were, however, a couple of sudden incursions of heat. On the 16th and 17th the thermometer passed 80° in many places, and reached 87° at Wimbledon and Greenwich. The 29th was nearly as warm. Fog was of frequent occurrence on the Western coasts; on the Eastern coasts, mainly the Northern half, round the 5th, and again from the 16th to the 25th. There were occasional reports of fog on the South Coast from the 12th to the 26th. Mean temperatures: Highest, 714°; lowest, 49.2°. Rainfall at Leyton, .33 inch. July.—Dull, dry, and rather cool. The month generally was cool, afternoon temperatures as high as 75° being attained but seldom. On the 1st, however, a few localities in England, Scotland and Ireland touched 78° or 79°. Between the 27th and 29th slightly higher readings were recorded in widely scattered districts, 82° at Marlborough, Welshpool and Ruthwell, and 83° at Killerton. Some South-Eastern stations were more than 4° below the month's normal. Fog was noted frequently on the Western coasts, mostly from the 1st to the 5th, and the 9th to the 15th on the Eastern coasts, while along the South Coast it was seldom mentioned. Mean temperatures: Highest, 68.2°; lowest, 5l.8°. Rainfall at Leyton, 2.61 inches. 31 August.—Calm, cool, dull and dry. Excepting in South-Western and Western England, where the weather was finer and brighter than elsewhere, temperature was below the normal by from 2° to 3° in places. There were few hot days, temperatures above 80° occurring on the 2nd to 4th, and 28th to 30th in various localities. Cold nights were uncommon, but there were some minima below 40° and on the morning of the 18th St. Andrews touched 32°. Damage by frost was reported at Linmere (Cheshire) on the 4th, and on the "Moss" lands, near Southport, on the 19th. Much fog was reported on the western coasts from the 1st to 3rd, 13th to 22nd, and 28th to 30th, and on the East Coast from the 27th to 31st. Mean temperatures: Highest, 71.1°; lowest, 52.0°. Rainfall at Leyton, 1.34 inches. September.—Little wind, heavy local rains. Temperature was in excess of the normal at nearly all stations, by more than 2° in many instances. The mildest period was round the 27th, when many places had maxima of 75° and upwards, 79° in several cases, and 82° at Whitby. Frost in the shade occurred in some of the more open situations, mostly on the morning of the 7th. During the second half of the month fogs were reported frequently on the Western and Eastern coasts, locally thick on several days, but along the South Coast they were seldom recorded. Mean temperatures : Highest, 67.8°; lowest, 50.2°. Rainfall at Leyton, 1.40 inches. 32 October.—Mild, wet in the plains. Tornado in South Wales. Mildness formed a very striking feature of the month. At Eastbourne and Portsmouth the temperature was more than 5°, and at Westminster 6°, above the normal. There was no cold weather with the exception of the 23rd and following night. Many observers comment on the open character of the month. Isleworth: "A beautiful month; in some respects the finest October during the 33 years of my personal records." Oundle: "A remarkably genial month; lilac and other spring flowers in bloom, and second crops of plums, raspberries, etc., gathered." Several of the observers remark that the days were generally fine to sunny, most of the rain experienced falling during the night hours. Fog was experienced over a wide area of the inland districts on several days, mainly about the 23rd to the 26th. Along the Western and Eastern coasts it was reported rather frequently, but rarely on the South Coast. Mean temperatures: Highest, 61.2°; lowest, 45.9°. Rainfall at Leyton, 3.27 inches. November.—Mild and windy. Variable rains. The month was remarkable for its almost uniform mildness in all parts of the Kingdom. Speaking generally, the afternoon temperatures were in the fifties, and the night minima in the forties. At very numerous stations there was no frost, and at the others the only frosts of note were between the 6th and the 9th and on the 23rd. Observers noted roses, wallflowers, primroses, dandelion in flower at Belper; strawberries in flower at 33 Wallington; the only November in 36 years without frost in the screen at Meltham; the finest in 32 years' records at Isleworth ; and so on. Several observers report magnificent glows at sunrise and sunset, especially from the 27th to the 30th. Fog was uncommonly rare for the season over the inland districts, rather frequent on the Western and Eastern coasts, seldom on the South Coast. Mean temperatures : Highest, 54.2°; lowest, 42.0°. Rainfall at Leyton, 2.05 inches. December.—Dry; usually mild. Except during the first week and several days late in the month the general level of temperature was much above the average. Maximum readings above 50° were very common, and the minima of the nights were also relatively high. The cold snap of the 6th and 7th gave some very low minima locally in the month. Late in the month the cold was more general, and the coldest night was the 31st. The general mildness of the month by one or two notes by the observers. At Rochford, Worcestershire : "Ripe wild strawberry picked from roadside on the 14th; abnormally large," and at Totland Bay: "Blackberries in full bloom on the 17th and 28th." Fog was reported on a few occasions on the SouthWest and East Coasts, but as a whole the atmosphere was clear for December, especially inland. Mean temperatures: Highest, 45.9°; lowest, 37.7°. Rainfall at Leyton, .67 inch. 34 NOTES ON SANITARY WORK AND MATTERS INCIDENTAL THERETO. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The Cann Hall Estate and Crescent Road Sewers to the extent reported in last year's Report have been re-laid. The surface water drains in Arundel and Borthwick Roads were recommended to be re-laid for a distance of about 100 yards, that in Ramsay Road from Odessa Road to Tavistock Road was similarly dealt with, as was also a small portion of the Sewer in the High Road, Leytonstone, which infringed on the private grounds of some houses, numbering 535 to 571. Many private drains have been re-constructed, for particulars of which see the Sanitary Inspector's Report. SEWAGE DISPOSAL. No alteration in the method of disposing of our sewage has been under contemplation. The scheme for admitting our sewage, together with that of several neighbouring authorities, into the London County Council's Sewers has not yet materialised. The new circular tank at the Sewage Works, to hold 500,000 gallons, the consideration of which by the Council was reported last year, has been commenced. 12,250 tons of sludge have been purchased of us during the year. POLLUTION OF RIVERS AND STREAMS IN THE DISTRICT. The Dagenham Brook and Waterworks River continues to be polluted by the effluents of Walthamstow and Leyton. 35 REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. No alteration in the system reported upon in the Reports of the past two years has taken place. Each house has its refuse removed twice weekly. The open two-wheeled cart is still used for the collection. 20,673 tons of house refuse and 340 tons of pressed sludge have been burnt in the Destructor. In 1912 21,312 tons, and in 1911 11,246 tons of house refuse were similarly burnt. Acting on the suggestion of the Medical Officer of Health, the Council ordered the discontinuance of dumping of house refuse in the grounds of the Sewage Works. OFFENSIVE TRADES. The Council has granted permission for the establishment of the trade of a fish fryer at 108, Harrow Road, and for that of a dealer in rags at 42, Beaumont Road. A request to allow a fish fryer to commence business in Hainault Road was refused. SANITARY CONVENIENCES. Last year it was stated that the proposal to build an underground convenience for both sexes in the Lea Bridge Road at its junction with Markhouse Road had been abandoned. The question of this site has recently been revived, but no definite action has been taken up to now. The problem as to how to provide a convenience in the neighbourhood of the junction of Crownfield, Cann Hall, and Leytonstone Roads still awaits solution. This is the position above all others where such a convenience is urgently demanded. 36 WATER SUPPLY OF THE DISTRICT. The supply of water to the district by the Metropolitan Water Board is quite satisfactory in all respects. MILK SUPPLY. As reported in former years very few cows are now kept in the district. Only 6 cowkeepers, who among them keep 50 cows, now remain. At the end of November Dr. Parbury, Medical Officer of Health for Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, wrote me that a case of Scarlet Fever had occurred in a farmhouse which supplied milk to Leytonstone through the Dairy Supply Company, Bloomsbury. The milk supply from this farm was stopped until the patient was removed to Hospital and the premises disinfected. No cases of Scarlet Fever were attributable to this incident. Some of the difficulties encountered in the endeavour to ensure the supply of clean milk to consumers were pointed out in last year's Report. Endeavour has been made by the Medical Officer of Health as far as possible to discourage the selling of milk by the small general dealer, but his powers in this direction are very limited. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. Two new slaughterhouses have been licensed. One of these slaughterhouses had been formerly used for this purpose, but its use had been discontinued for many years. The Medical Officer of Health considered the premises unsuitable in view of their proximity to dwellings and the dark and badly designed lairage. In consideration of his Report the Public Health Committee first refused to grant the licence, but on a further application being made they assented. 37 The applicants for the other licence were the Stratford Cooperative Society, who are adapting premises in Union Road, formerly occupied by the North Metropolitan Tramways Company, to the purposes of their business. No objection could reasonably be raised to these premises. They were entirely re-constructed for the purpose of slaughtering on an extensive scale, and no expense was spared to make them suitable for the purpose. Two new licences, renewable annually, were granted to purchasers of old businesses where the vendors had held slaughter house licences. TUBERCULOUS MEAT. Four pig carcases exhibiting evidences of Tuberculosis were surrendered by a butcher. They came through the Central Meat Market from Woburn, Bedfordshire. The Medical Officer of Health wrote to the Medical Officer under whose supervision the district of VVoburn is situated, who made inquiries, and the County Police were communicated with, but no proceedings were taken. MOSQUITO NUISANCE. The following is a resume issued in the form of a Report to the Public Health Committee of a Conference held to consider what steps should be taken to abolish or mitigate the nuisance caused by mosquitoes to dwellers in the neighbourhood of and visitors to Epping Forest : — CONFERENCE ON MOSQUITO NUISANCE. By your desire I attended, on September 23rd, the Conference convened by the Chingford Council on the above subject, held at the Essex County Council Offices, in Broad Street Place. 38 A fair number of representatives from the various districts abutting on the Forest, as well as a good many of the Forest Commissioners, attended. A paper was read by Dr. Brook, Medical Officer of Health for Chingford, in which he embodied a Report by Dr. Ross, of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, an acknowledged authority on mosquitoes. Dr. Thresh, the County Medical Officer of Health, also contributed certain facts. Several lay speakers testified to the nuisance caused by these insects in the neighbourhood of the Forest. The following is a general summary of the facts :— The mosquitoes which infest the Forest and its surroundings are of the variety "Culex." The mosquitoes which convey the germs of Malaria, Yellow Fever, etc., viz., the Anopheles and the Stegomyia Fasciata, have not been found hereabouts. But as 100 years or so ago Essex and the Fen country were malarial districts, the possibility of invasion of the district by this former variety must not be lost sight of. The female mosquito lays her eggs in stagnant water. When the eggs hatch out the resulting larva; swim about in the water, but they have frequently to come to the surface to breathe, and it has been found that by covering the surface of the water with oil of some kind, e.g., paraffin, the larvae are drowned. Any collections of stagnant water, rain water butts, pools, ponds, etc., form favourable breeding places for mosquitoes. From the time the eggs are laid till they become the mature insects, a period of ten days elapses. Consequently if vessels used for storing water are emptied weekly, the larvae are destroyed. 39 Large collections of water—lakes, rivers, etc.—are not favourable to the breeding of mosquitoes, as the movement of the water drowns the larvae. Certain fish, too—goldfish and millions—are very fond of the larvae, and consume large numbers of them. From a consideration of the above facts certain preventive measures can be deduced. All collections of stagnant water should, as far as possible, be abolished. In this respect the local Sanitary Inspector can do much in the way of securing proper paving round houses, seeing that the gutterings round roofs are kept in repair, and by persuading people who store water for gardening purposes, or for animals' drinking, to empty the receptacles at least once a week. Collections of stagnant water in ponds, etc., may be sprayed with paraffin. Larvae-consuming fish may be stocked in ponds, etc. I was asked to propose the motion:— "That this Conference of representatives of Local Authorities in the Epping Forest District, and of the Epping Forest Commissioners, deem it desirable to institute a campaign against the mosquito nuisance." Mr. Bird, who seconded the motion, asked for permission to add, " And that a copy of the reports be sent to each delegate." The motion was carried nem. con., and a fairly large SubCommittee was formed, of which I was appointed a member. There is plenty of evidence to show that even although the mosquito does not in this country convey the serious and fatal diseases it does in the tropics, yet it is capable of causing much annoyance and mischief, even leading in rare cases to the death of the object of its attentions. 40 For the above reasons, and also because the mosquito has never been shown to play any useful part in the economy of nature, I am of opinion that the Conference was justified in taking action in the matter. In connection with this matter the Leyton Council agreed, with the consent of the Forest Commissioners, to fill in certain stagnant ponds on forest land in the vicinity of the Whipp's Cross Road, Leytonstone. HOUSING. The number of workers in Leyton who require housing are comparatively few, and are amply catered for by private enterprise. By far the greater number of the inhabitants of Leyton, as has been previously pointed out, are workers in the metropolis. The competition among railways, tramways and omnibus companies in the matter of fares and expedition of transit, added to an enormous number of cheaply rented houses, attracts the man of moderate means. It is the families of this type of man, the clerk, artisan, etc., who constitute the bulk of Leyton's inhabitants. For their convenience, and for his own pecuniary benefit, the speculative builder has been very active, so much so that at the present time the district has almost reached the limits of its expansion. There are very few vacant sites left on which to erect houses. All this building has been done in recent years and in accordance with modern building bye-laws. It therefore follows that the number of houses which are unrepairable owing to faulty construction is a practically negligible one. For this reason a closing order is rarely required, and no order for demolition has up to now been issued. A system of house to house inspection has been carried out for many years. Under this system practically all the houses in the 41 district have been inspected, and the details of their construction is well known to us. The houses in certain roads, owing chiefly to the class of tenants occupying them, are continually becoming more or less insanitary. These receive frequent periodical attention. In the future it is probable that a poorer class of London worker will select Leyton for his home. One who is unable to pay the rent demanded for tenements as they now exist. Then overcrowding, with its attendant nuisances, will be the chief problem with which we shall have to deal. STATEMENT, required by Article V. of the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910, in regard to the inspection of dwelling-houses under section 17 (1) of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909.

Factories.—The duties of a District Council in the case of factories (i.e., places where mechanical power is used, and places where certain industries as specified in Part 1, Schedule 6, of the Act, are carried on) are limited; dealing chiefly with the provision of escape in case of fire, and of the provision of suitable sanitary conveniences. In the case of bakehouses there are also special duties to be carried out. 18 visits were made to factories during 1913, and in 10 cases nuisances were dealt with and remedied. Workshops.—The workshops in the District have been systematically inspected. At the beginning of 1913 the number of workshops and workplaces on the register was 284, and at the close 303, and are grouped as follows :— On Register 31st Dec., 1913. Manufacture of blouses, underclothing, &c. 99 ,, ,, boots, shoes, &c 22 ,, ,, ties, neckwear, &c. 17 ,, ,, leather goods 1 ,, ,, brushes 1 ,, ,, polishes 1 ,, ,, scales 1 ,, ,, heating apparatus 1 ,, ,, ether sprays 1 ,, ,, wooden boxes 1 ,, ,, furs 2 Dressmaking 32 Millinery 13 Tailoring and alteration of costumes 17 Art-needlework and embroideries 2 Corset-making 1 Bakehouses 46 Laundries 15 Cabinet-making, &c. 6 49 Chopping firewood 6 Rag-sorting 2 Cycle repairing and motor works 2 Wheelwright 3 Wire-workers 4 Printing and book-binding 3 Sheet steel and asbestos works, &c. 3 Cork-cutting 1 303 77 workshops have been removed from the register during the year. In 28 instances the occupiers re-opened at another address in the District, and these are included in the foregoing list. In 31 cases the work was given up entirely, and in the remaining 18 it was found that the occupiers of the workshops had left our District. Failure on the part of 43 occupiers of workshops to affix an Abstract of the Factory and Workshop Act, in accordance with section 133 of the Act, were notified to H.M. Inspector of Factories. 900 inspections of workshops have been made during the year, and nuisances numbering 325 were found to exist, and on the necessary steps being taken the insanitary conditions were remedied. 50 We received notice from H.M. Inspector of Factories of 13 nuisances existing in factories and workshops, and remediable under the Public Health Acts, which I give below, with result of action taken:— Notice received. Description of Premises. Nuisance notified. Reply to Factory Inspector.

Hush cistern overflowing ... „ „ Homework.—The District Council, under Sections 107—110 of this Act, are given important powers for controlling the conditions under which certain classes of work, as specified from time to time by the Secretary of State, are done in the homes of the workers. A register is kept of the names and addresses of the outworkers, and the homes are regularly inspected, with a view to securing a hygienic standard in all places where such work is done. Any insanitary conditions found to exist are dealt with and remedied, and where a case of infectious disease occurs at any of 51 the addresses notified on the outworkers' lists, necessary precautions are taken to prevent the spread of the disease; the work found in such houses is disinfected, and if the case is being treated at home further work is forbidden on the premises until all risk of infection has passed. Infectious diseases this year occurred in 13 of the outworkers' homes, and the necessary precautions as given above were taken. In 1913 the addresses of 695 outworkers were received from other Councils, and 21 other addresses sent in error to our District were forwarded to the proper authorities. Lists containing 225 names have been forwarded to other Councils in whose districts outworkers employed by Leyton firms reside:— To Walthamstow 101 „ Hackney 41 „ West Ham 37 „ Stepney 20 „ Bethnal Green 6 „ Poplar 5 „ East Ham 4 „ Islington 3 „ Guildhall 3 „ Holborn 2 „ Whitechapel 2 „ Stamford Hill 1 225 We have continued to visit likely employers of outworkers of the various trades in the District, and advised them as to their responsibility in the matter, with the result that we now have a more complete list of addresses where the work is being done. Many reminder notices still have to be sent to employers, who are very dilatory in sending in their lists, and we still receive from 52 other Councils many incorrect addresses, this being the result of the employers not properly revising their lists before notifying. We have communicated with the various Councils through whom the lists are received, and almost without exception they have made the necessary enquiries and obtained for us the correct particulars. 1,910 visits were paid to outworkers' premises, and 1,618 inspections of their homes were paid. The difference, 292, is accounted for by the fact that the addresses returned on the lists were found to be incorrect or the outworkers had removed since the previous visit. Removals in most instances have been traced. Uncleanly and insanitary conditions were found and dealt with in 497 cases ; they generally were not of a serious nature. 53 REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE TEMPORARY ISOLATION HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1913. The Hospital, which accommodates 70 Scarlet Fever and 22 Diphtheria patients, has adequately served the needs of the district. The work of the Staff, under the superintendence of the Matron, has been carried out in an unostentatious but thoroughly efficient manner, and many letters expressing gratitude have been received from patients and their friends. Numerically the Staff is precisely the same as last year. Changes among the subordinate members occasionally occur, as is the case in all similar institutions, but among the seniors no change has taken place for several years. Discipline is well maintained, and the duties are cheerfully carried out. STAFF. Medical Superintendent, J. F. Taylor, M.R.C.S., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health; Matron, Miss E. Ryan; Sister, Miss F. Pikeman ; Charge Nurses, Miss K. Oswald and Miss S. Barnard. In addition to the above there are 11 Assistant Nurses. The female domestic staff number 11. The male staff consists of two Porters, the part-time services of the two Ambulance Porters, and a Relief Porter. IMPROVEMENTS. The principal improvement decided on during the year is the provision of a new building of the same type as those already in existence, e.g., corrugated iron. This building, which is 28 feet 54 long by 14 feet wide, is divided into two—the larger portion, viz., 20 feet by 14 feet, is to be used as a dining and recreation room for the Nurses. The smaller portion, 8 feet by 14 feet, is adapted for a store room. The entire building is to cost ,£87, in addition to which £50 is to be spent on the brick and concrete foundations. The desirability of providing this building arose from the fact that the domestic staff have always been obliged to take their meals in the kitchen. The new arrangement, by providing a new room for the Nurses, allows the one at present used by them to be converted for the use of the female domestic staff. The paths in the grounds of the Hospital have been re-dressed with bitumen and granite chips. A stove to burn anthracite coal has been installed into the male acute Scarlet Fever Ward in place of a "Tortoise" stove which was worn out. A portable operating table has been purchased. PATIENTS. The total number of patients treated during the year was 321. In 1912 the number was 305, in 1911 372, and 1910 442. Scarlet Fever accounted for 223 and Diphtheria for 98. The total number of patients' days in Hospital was 14,216. The total amount expended on the Hospital was £2,966 17s. 10d., which gives an average cost of 4s. 2d. per patient per diem. The amount expended on provisions was £813 19s. lid., which includes the cost of food for the Staff. This gives a daily average of Is. T7d. per patient. 55 STATISTICAL RETURNS. Admissions.

TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE LEYTON URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Twenty-third Annual Report for the year ending December 31st, 1913. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. 1,093 cases of Infectious Diseases were notified during the above-mentioned period. On the receipt of a notification of a case of Infectious Disease, the house is visited, instructions given as to isolation of the infectious sick, and when the case is treated at home subsequent visits are made to see that the isolation is being properly carried out. Enquiries are made as to schools attended, number of inmates, how employed, caution as to sending infected clothing to laundries, and against taking into the house milk cans belonging to milk vendors; enquiries are also made as to whether any work is carried out in the house, and if such is the case the matter is immediately dealt with. The whole of the above work is carried out under the direction and supervision of the Medical Officer of Health. Appended is a summary of the work in connection therewith: Houses disinfected and the sanitary arrangements examined and tested: Tuberculosis Cases 253 Other Infectious Diseases 494 58 Loads of infected bedding removed to be disinfected at the Council's Steam Disinfector and returned 619 Books belonging to Public Institutions disinfected 66 Number of articles of wearing apparel disinfected 1302 Disinfectants are supplied in cases of Infectious Disease, and can be obtained at the Town Hall at any time during office hours.

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Sixth Annual Report as your School Medical Officer. The Report in some material respects differs from that of former years. The Board of Education having prescribed certain forms for statistical records of Medical Inspection, these have been adopted in the present Report in the place of those previously used. It gives me pleasure to record that the recommendation contained in my Report of last year has received your whole-hearted co-operation, viz., the adoption of methods of treatment for certain ailments encountered in the course of Medical Inspection. Thus the treatment of Ringworm (by drugs) and of minor ailments is already in force, and you have agreed to undertake the treatment of defective vision and of dental defects. The treatment of defective vision you have made arrangements to commence on the 1st of April, but that of dental defects must be delayed until a suitable extension of our present premises at the Town Hall is completed. In conclusion, I desire to thank all the members and officials of the Education Committee, and I desire to especially mention my colleague Dr. Ball, for many acts of kindness and assistance rendered to me during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. FRANCIS TAYLOR. 78 Table 1.—Number of Children Inspected. A "Routine" Age. Entrants. 3 4 5 6 Other ages. Total.

At the beginning of September the treatment of Ringworm and minor ailments was commenced. Cases necessitating free treatment are filtered through the Inspection Clinic, where they are seen each morning by the School Medical Officer and either supplied with ointment, etc., for home use, or the Health Visitor, who is always present at the Inspections, is directed to carry out the treatment. 92 The records of the cases treated during the four months with which this Report deals are incomplete, but a card system has since been adopted which will remedy this defect in the future The number of inspections made during the year was 4,354, and the following is a list of the diseases dealt with:— Ringworm 158 Alopecia Areata 5 Verminous Cases 397 Impetigo Contagiosa 106 Eczema 60 Herpes 4 Scabies 14 Other Forms of Skin Disease 72 Boils and Abscesses 10 Desquamation of Fingers 2 Defective Vision 5 Conjunctivitis 24 Keratitis 4 Blepharitis 41 Trachoma 1 Otorrhoea 10 Rhinorrhœa 2 Tonsillitis 10 Adenoids 3 Heart Disease 4 Bronchitis 3 Phthisis 10 Referred to Tuberculosis Officer 30 Other Forms of Tuberculosis 3 Enlarged Glands 19 Mental Derangements 4 Epilepsy 3 Anæmia and Debility 6 Diphtheria 2 Mumps 28 Chicken Pox 2 Whooping Cough 1 Rickets 2 Miscellaneous 8 93 RINGWORM OF SCALP. 51 cases of Ringworm of the Scalp were certified as fit to return to school during the year. Of these the following is a return of the length of time absence from school was necessary:— Under 1 month — 1 to 3 months 3 3 ,, 4 ,, 5 4 „ 6 „ 15 6 „ 8 „ 10 8 „ 10 „ 3 10 „ 12 6 12 „ 14 „ 3 14 „ 16 „ 2 16 „ 18 „ — 18 „ 20 „ 1 20 „ 25 „ 1 30 months 1 43 „ 1 8 cases were lost sight of on account of having left school or removed from the district. VERMINOUS AND OTHER CONDITIONS DUE TO NEGLECT. After the lapse of several weeks' exclusion from school, during which time they have been instructed and cautioned, the parents are summoned to attend before the various School Attendance Sub-Committees. The parents of 217 children were thus dealt with and prosecutions ordered in 47 instances. The following are the results of the prosecutions:— 1 fine of 10s. and 4s. costs. 1 fine of 5s. and 4s. costs 1 fine of 2s. 6d. and 4s. costs. 30 fines of 1s. and 4s. costs. 6 attendance orders with 4s. costs were made. 8 cases were adjourned or withdrawn. 94 BLIND CHILDREN. Two blind children are being maintained at the Council's expense at the East London Home and School for Blind Children at Clapton. One child, who had reached the age of 16 years, was discharged from this Institution in July. DEFECTIVE BLIND CHILDREN. One girl is residing at the Hastings and St. Leonard's Home. DEAF AND DUMB CHILDREN. Eight children are attending the Water Lane Deaf and Dumb Centre, West Ham, and one child is at the Royal Asylum, Margate. THE MENTAL DEFICIENCY ACT, 1913. This Act, which came into force on April 1st, 1914, gives powers for dealing with certain weak-minded individuals for whom previous legislation has not provided. Defectives of a marked type, such as idiots and imbeciles, have for long come under the provisions of the legislature, but it was felt that another class, known as the feeble-minded, should receive similar protection by the State, not only for their own good, but also for that of the public at large. The Local Authorities which are appointed to administer the Act are County and County Borough Councils; and the latter are required to ascertain what defectives in their area are amenable to the provisions of the Act, and to provide accommodation for them in suitable institutions. It may be pointed out that a large number of recognized defectives will not be liable to be dealt with under the Act. The Local Education Authority is responsible for bringing to the notice of the County Council the defectives aged 7 to 16 which 95 come under the Act. The following include the chief circumstances which will bring defective children under the operation of the Act:— 1. In the case of idiots, imbeciles, or feeble-minded, at the request of their parents or guardians. 2. In the case of neglected or ill-treated defectives. 3. In the case of defectives convicted or liable to be convicted of crime. 4. In the case of defectives liable to be sent to an industrial school. 5. In the case of moral imbeciles. With regard to these groups, certification of idiots and imbeciles is to be made by two medical practitioners, one being the family doctor (if possible) and the other a medical practitioner approved for the purpose by the Local Authority. In addition to these two certificates, in the case of the feeble-minded an order must also be obtained from a Justice of the Peace. EPILEPTIC CHILDREN. One girl is still at Chalfont St. Peter's. One boy has been sent to the Home for Epileptics at Maghull, Liverpool. Children who suffer from Epileptic Fits, not too frequent or too severe, are encouraged to attend ordinary schools. PROVISION OF MEALS. The same arrangements for feeding necessitous children attending the elementary schools as formerly reported are still in existence. The attempt to estimate the effect of feeding the children by weighing them weekly has not been successful. 96 It was arranged that the children on the feeding lists should present themselves at the Town Hall on Saturday morning to be weighed, but their attendance has been so irregular that no reliable data have been obtained. LEYTON CHILDREN'S COUNTRY HOLIDAY FUND. This Voluntary Fund was started last year by a committee of lr.dies and gentlemen residing in the district. Its object is to secure for as many of the Leyton School children as its funds will allow a short holiday in the country or seaside. The Chairman of the Fund is Mr. Councillor Read, a member of the Education Committee, and his wife, Mrs. Read, is the hon. secretary. On June 20th 39 girls were sent to the Girls' Bungalow at Canvey Island, and on July 25th 49 boys were sent away. "The arrangements were all carried out satisfactorily, the weather was extremely favourable, and in every case good reports were received of the homes to which the children were sent. "Great care is taken in seeing that only suitable cases are helped. To secure this the committee has been most materially aided by the Superintendent of School Visitors, Mr. Lash, and his staff." The above quotation from the annual report of the Fund illustrates that the Fund is doing good work on the right lines, and it is to be hoped the financial assistance necessary for its extension will be forthcoming. 97 FIRE AT TRUMPINGTON ROAD SCHOOL. On the morning of August 21st a fire broke out in the top floor of this school which resulted in the entire destruction of the roof and damage by water to the three departments below. The fire appeared to have started in the tank room adjoining the headmaster's room on the top floor, but the cause was not traced. This fire interfered with the ordinary resumption of work at this school at the end of August, and the girls' and infants' departments were not fit to be re-opened until October 6th, while the boys' department was closed until after the Christmas vacation. In consequence the routine medical inspection of the "leavers" at this school could not be undertaken until the beginning of the The word indisposition should read inspection. embodied in the present report as ???? uring 1913. MORE SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION. The new building in Church Road adjoining the old school of that name, and referred to in last year's Report, has been finished and is now occupied. It provides accommodation for 840 children, 420 in each department. The question of the re-building of High Road School is still sub judice. Improvements effected in the Schools during the year. The external parts of the following schools were painted during the summer vacation: — Capworth Street. Church Road. Downsell Road. 98 Harrow Green. Norlington Road. Ruckholt Road. Trumpington Road. The latrines belonging to all the schools in the district were cleansed, lime whited and overhauled, and the drains flushed during the Easter vacation. The suggestion contained in my Report of last year as to the necessity for the school windows being cleaned between the Summer and Christmas vacations, in addition to the four annual cleanings they now receive, has not been acted upon. I wish to again bring this matter under the notice of the committee. Each school has been supplied with four toilet boxes and a supply of paper for use in the latrines; the estimated cost being £9 16s. for the boxes, and £28 annually for the paper. The ordinary mica flaps provided to the drain air-inlets being continually reported by the Sanitary Inspectors to be out of order, frequently through the mischievous interference of the scholars, I suggested the use of Barker's patent air-inlets, which cannot be thus interfered with. The committee have in consequence instructed the architect in future to replace any defective air-inlets by ones of this pattern. Improvements at Individual Schools. Cann Hall Road School. In September the Council decided on an additional exit in rase of fire, and agreed to provide an external iron staircase leading from the upper floor of the Boys' Department. 99 Canterbury Road School. 1.
