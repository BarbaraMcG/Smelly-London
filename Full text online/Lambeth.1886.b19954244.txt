Thirty-first Annual Report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being a Report for the year 1886 on the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. The population of the Parish of Lambeth is estimated for the year commencing January, 1886, at 274,196 persons, and upon this computation the vital statistics contained in this report are calculated. On account of the number of uninhabited houses in the Outer Wards, and the inactivity in building operations, it would not be consistent with accuracy to estimate the increase of the population of Lambeth, upon the basis which obtained at a period when the parish was becoming rapidly developed, and when the augmentation was consequently a very large one. Therefore, I have thought it necessary to digress from the principles adopted in former years, and to base my calculations upon the natural increment which augments the population from the excess in the number of the births over the number of the deaths registered during the year.

The registration district Waterloo Road First, is the most thickly populated, the average being 245 persons to the acre; Lambeth Church Second has 232 persons to the acre; Lambeth Church First, on account of the Palace 3 grounds and a portion of the Embankment being included in its area, has only 132 persons to the acre; whilst Brixton and Norwood have respectively 47 and 20 per acre.

The births registered in Lambeth are decreasing in number year by year. In 1886, 9047 births appear upon the register, a decrease of 96 upon the previous year, and of 470 upon the year 1884. The males number 4599, and the females 4448: the males having a majority of 151, E 2 The Table shows the number of Births in each District, and a comparison of number of Births registered in each Quarter.

The Metropolitan rate for 1886 was 32.3 per 1000, the lowest rate on record since 1850. MARRIAGE RATE. The number of marriages celebrated in Lambeth show a decrease upon last year of 91. Like the birth rate the marriage rate has fallen year by year, and the number is diminishing notwithstanding the increase of the population. The marriages registered this year are fewer in number than in any annual return made during the last decade, with the exception of that of 1882. Year. No. of Marriages. Year.

Thus in the year 1886, eight persons fewer in every thousand were married than in the year 1877. The marriage rate of Lambeth for 1886 is 15.8 per 1000. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 16.6 per 1000.

The deaths from all causes, registered in Lambeth during the year 1886, were 5460, of these 2747 were males and 2713 females. This number includes the deaths of 443 persons who had been removed to the Hospitals situated in Lambeth but who had previously lived in other parishes of the Metropolis; on the other hand 200 parishioners died in the outlying institutions in the Metropolis, and 67 parishioners died in extra Metropolitan institutions. Having deducted the former and added the latter, the number of deaths proper to Lambeth is 52S4, representing a death rate of 19.2 per 1000 persons living. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 19.9 per 1000. In the Metropolis the registered deaths numbered 82,276, and the rate was the lowest on record, with the exception of that of last year, which was 19.8. The death rate of London during the last 40 years has steadily fallen: in the southern districts this is especially marked: some of the years during the period have been remarkable for fatality, others for health. The year 1849 surpassed all others in its mortality. The rate was 30.1 per 1000 for the whole Metropolis, but in the southern districts no less than 37.6 in every thousand living persons died. Following upon this destructive year, 1850 boasts the lowest rate recorded up to that time. On account of the dissimilarity of the units it is somewhat difficult to follow the descending rate through the lapse of 40 years, but by grouping the years into terms of five, the average rates of successive periods show an almost unbroken line of increasing longevity. 8 From 1847 to 1851, average annual death rate 27.7 per 1000 „ 1852 „ 1856 „ „ „ 25.9 „ „ 1857 „ 1861 „ „ 22.6 „ „ 1862 ,, 1866 „ ,, „ 237 „ ,, 1867 „ 1871 „ „ „ 23.2 ft „ 1872 „ 1876 „ „ „ 21.5 ,, „ 1877 „ l88l „ „ „ 21.4 „ „ 1882 „ 1886 „ „ „ 19.5 „ This table shows that the fall has been regular and continuous, with the single exception of the third period. There is one fact which is brought into very clear light by these figures, and it is this—The span of human life is gradually becoming lengthened: a man living under the conditions of life which obtain in 1886 has a more extended term than he who lived under the conditions which existed in 1847. The average lease of life held by the one is two or three years longer than that held by the other. Now in what manner have the unfavourable conditions of life been so modified from those of forty years ago, that this result should ensue? Much difference of opinion exists and many explanatory conjectures have been advanced, but I think it must be conceded that several causes have been in operation which have been promoted, fostered, and expanded under the broadening influences of an advancing civilization, and have concurrently contributed to the result. The mortality in a London district bears a relationship to the degree of the poverty, or of the competence of its people, in worldly possessions: if the poor element predominate, the rate proportionately rises; if the rich, it correspondingly falls; hence the agencies that increase the material prosperity of a people, to a parallel extent, reduce the death roll. The converse holds good: that which adds 9 to the poverty of the poor or extends mendicity has a proportional effect in diminishing longevity; longevity therefore exists in an inverse ratio to the poverty of a town community. If the agencies which have had an effect in ameliorating the condition of the poor can be traced, we shall find some at least of the influences that have been instrumental in reducing the death rate. In this respect no other factor, in my opinion, may be considered equal with, or can even be compared to, education. Education, by the initiation of the young in the elementary principles of knowledge, has opened the portals of innumerable avenues leading to remunerative employment, closed to the ignorant and untaught. The children of the pauper and mendicant are withdrawn from the atmosphere of vice and intemperance to which their fathers have become acclimatized, and arc placed under supervision in the schoolroom; under the bracing influence of discipline, habits of industry arc formed, the powers of reasoning arc strengthened, and the judgment becomes more evenly balanced. The young man enters life with an improved chance of success; he is capable of forming a wider estimate of virtue and vice, of the certain emoluments of the former and the inevitable disadvantages of the latter. Pauperism has thus been attacked and partially overcome. The wider intelligence of our age has adopted a more excellent remedy than that which had credit with the last generation. Our fathers attempted to rid themselves of pauperism, on the one hand, by the legislative enactment of pains and penalties ; on the other hand, by the lavish and indiscriminate distribution of charity; but in spite of these measures, whether alone or in combination, pauperism refused either to be banished by coercion or bought out by dole. 10 The growth and development of sanitary science, together with the adoption of its teachings by all sections of the public, has cleared away a mass of vague superstition which had lingered in the minds of the ignorant from past generations. Disease was looked upon as a visitation of providence and as a punishment for sin, and whilst it was regarded as supernatural in origin, it is not a matter of surprise that no steps were taken—or only very inefficient ones—either to prevent an outbreak or to limit its extension. Superstition produced fatalism, and it was considered wicked, or at least useless, to fight against that which was deemed the inevitable. But time has advanced, education has changed the conditions of life, and with them the opinions of men. Disease is no longer regarded as a manifestation of the anger of an offended Deity, nor as the outcome and consequence of the breach or the neglect of a divine law, but as the result of natural causes, modified by varying conditions, and obeying fixed natural laws. The introduction of the microscope into the service of research, and the continued study of the life-history of vegetable growth in its lowest forms, have resulted in the discovery of the origin and nature of infectious disease, and have led to a more exact knowledge of the rise, extension, and subsidence of epidemics, and to the adoption of a more effectual method for their limitation and prevention. The unit of infection is a microscopic particle or microbe endowed with specific properties; it has the power, when deposited in a suitable soil and under favourable conditions, of multiplication to an indefinite extent; hence, when implanted in the blood of a human being, in virtue of this power, it proliferates, and invades the fluids even to the finest capillary networks, and like the yeast in the baker's dough, leavens the whole. 11 But the microbe sometimes finds a habitat outside the human body, and colonics arc formed in decomposing animal or vegetable matter; in the effete material of the drains; in the organic contents of the dust bin, arid elsewhere; and from the consequent augmentations of its poisonous particles, the chances are increased of the admission of its elements into the water and the food, and of their ingestion by those who arc predisposed to infection. From the light conveyed by these facts, the early removal of organic refuse from the neighbourhood of the houses of the people receives additional importance; and the perfect disconnection of the house drain from the sewer, together with the enforcement of measures which are effectual in the prevention of the contamination of the air by sewer gas, is a matter of the first consideration. The importance of this subject may be recognised when it is considered that sewer gas may find access by a drain, which has not been disconnected, or which is faulty, and as the sewer acts as a bond of communication between house and house, from the existence of an infectious case in one house, disease may be generated in many. The abolition of the cesspool and its replacement by a system of drainage had not at first that success in the abatement of disease which might have been expected from a sanitary measure so advanced. The builders who had the practical means at their disposal, and who were responsible for carrying into effect those improvements in house drainage, which a knowledge of the poisonous properties of sewer gas dictated, ignored the existence of that knowledge and neglected to give efTect to its teaching. The truth or the reverse of the theory that sewer gas is dangerous to health was to them a matter of indifference. There is a class of men, so called practical—and builders for the most part belong to this order—who regard all things 12 outside the sphere of their mental apprehension as chimerical or else theoretical, and in consequence unworthy of consideration; but if their reasoning capacity could be only a little extended, if they could lift up, as it were, the fringe of the curtain that bounds their mental horizon, they would clearly see that those things which are true in theory are also true in practice—that the theory of to-day is the practice of to-morrow—that theory is based upon fact and differs fundamentally from mere conjecture or hypothesis. Until the theory of the poisonous effects of sewer gas had a practical demonstration in repeated illnesses and frequent deaths among those who had been exposed to its influence, builders continued to disregard the teaching of science, and to construct the drains of houses in such manner as though an atmosphere pervaded by sewer gas was a thing to be desired, all remonstrance to the contrary notwithstanding. All infectious diseases are caused by the agency of microbes. The germ theory of disease is no longer a conjecture, nor is it founded upon the research or statement of any one class of observers. Any scientific man trained in the methods of research may verify for himself the fact of the existence, and trace the growth and development, of these minute enemies to mankind. The species of microbes which cause disease are numerous; every specific disease is caused by its specific microbe, and therefore it is not in accord with scientific teaching to suppose that one specific disease may be metamorphosed into another. Yet this inconsistency in reasoning is a prevalent one— one frequently hears that an ulcerated throat has turned into diphtheria, or a pneumonia into typhoid. When the farmer sows a field, if the seed be wheat, the crop will be also wheat, if he sow oats he may expect, and that reasonably, to reap oats; if reasoning is to be relied upon at all, it must be 13 inferred that of whatever variety of corn the crop is composed, that variety has been sown, and with equal certainty we infer that of whatever kind of fever a man may be the subject he must have been infected by the germ peculiar to that fever, and by no other—that germ alone being capable of producing the combination of symptoms that we witness and call by a special name. Hence the conception of disease, as to cause and nature is no longer a confused one, but on the contrary clear and distinct, and on this account it may be reasonably expected that at no distant future, effective means may be found to prevent the incidence, limit the extent, and to place an obstacle against the recurrcnce of infectious disease. A practical result of the more exact knowledge of disease is exemplified in the present mode of dealing with infection, and in the more just appreciation attained of what constitutes a disinfectant. A "disinfectant" cannot serve the purpose for which it is employed without it disinfects; but to accomplish this end it must destroy the living microbe of infection: if it fails to do this it is useless, or useless to that degree in which it fails. But even to the minds of well-educated people the disinfectant is invested with a mystic and fanciful importance, altogether out of proportion to any inherent quality it may possess. Like the electric locket, the bell and book of the priest, or the caul which the sailor wears about his neck, some evil-smelling compound from the chemist is exalted into a fetish, or valued as a charm that shall exorcise or conjure away the danger of infection. I fear that in making this statement I am in danger of offending the susceptibilities of many who would not consider it consistent with the opinions they entertain of their own intelligence to be thought capable of holding notions so 14 much at variance with common sense, nor would I impute notions of such child-like simplicity to those of whom I have spoken, if it could be conceived upon what other hypothesis their attitude upon the subject of disinfection may be explained. It is also a matter for regret, that a fanciful value should be placed upon the use of disinfectants, or that they should be endowed, in the eyes of the public, with magical attributes, for extreme views are likely to lead to re-action, and, sooner or later, a useful adjunct, failing to fulfil the requirements of the position of confidence to which it has been raised by a credulous public, is in danger of sinking to a lower estimate in popular favour than its modest value warrants, and of falling into total disrepute. Nor is this the only reason. If more reliance be placed in the disinfectant than is consistent with its virtues, other and more effective measures may be disregarded, and the evils which, in another case, would have been removed, remain as a danger to the health of the public. Many instances have come under my notice illustrative of the above remarks, in which serious structural defects in drainage have existed, and of such a character that the air of the dwelling-house has been impregnated with sewer gas; yet the occupier has lived in the unhealthy atmosphere in the enjoyment of a happy sense of security, and until illness has placed a limit to his misplaced confidence, has firmly believed that no danger to his health existed, whilst he daily had followed the expedient of pouring Condy's fluid into the vortex of the drain, and had taken the additional precaution of dusting the ironwork at its inlet with carbolic powder. When a case of sickness of an infectious character occurs, it is a common custom to place a receptacle, containing a small quantity of disinfecting fluid, in a prominent place in 15 the sick chamber, and in this action it is believed that something has been done which shall materially modify the infectious character of the atmosphere. Now it may be observed that when a ray of sunlight penetrates a darkened room from between the edges of the almost closed shutters, and falls as a broad band across the field of vision, the part of the air illuminated is crowded with motes floating in the light and again lost in the shadow, and wafted into commotion with every breath. Such is a fair conception of the distribution of the particles of infection which infest the air in the chambers of the infected sick. Let us consider what effect a saucerful of disinfectant would have upon an atmosphere whose pernicious elements were so numerous and distributed, and in what manner the vitality of the suspended particles could be modified by its germicidal properties. Let us suppose the height of the room to be ten feet, the breadth fifteen feet, and the length twenty feet. A room, the size of which, would correspond to these measurements, contains a volume of 3000 cubic feet of air, the fluid introduced to modify the properties of this volume o air would expose a superficial surface measuring about twelve square inches. As the exposure to the exhalation arising at ordinary temperatures from disinfecting fluids docs not extinguish the vitality of the putrefactive microbe, it cannot be assumed that it would destroy the germinal functions of the microbe of disease, the two atoms having many characteristics in common. Unless, therefore, the suspended particles are brought into actual contact with the fluid, we are constrained to believe that their integrity cannot be seriously affected. Now, bring again before your mental vision the illustration, the ray of light in the darkened room and the innumerable motes disclosed by its impact; picture the movements 16 of the illuminated particles, and consider the interval of time which must inevitably elapse before the suspended atoms, contained in an area of even one cubic foot, could fortuitously be conveyed into proximity with the fluid, or be driven to impinge upon its surface. But even if we admit for the sake of this calculation, that which cannot be admitted in fact, namely, that the disinfectant is sufficiently powerful to destroy, in one minute the vitality of the microbes, in the twelve cubic inches of air superincumbent upon its surface, and that this volume could be replaced in successive quantities, at intervals of one minute, the infected taking the place of the sterilized, and the process continued, six hundred hours would elapse before the sterilization could be completed. It must now be admitted, even in reasoning upon any theory of probabilities, that not a conceivable fraction of the number of the infected particles, contained in the air of a sick room, could be destroyed, by the action of disinfecting fluids, even though exposed for an unlimited length of time. The small quantity of air which finds access through a niche in the door, and by which a corresponding volume of vitiated air is displaced, has a more perfect action, and has immeasurably more effect, than disinfectants used in the manner indicated, in the purification of the air of the sick chamber. The infected atmosphere of the sick room is injurious, alike, to the attendant, and to the patient; to the one, by inducing a predisposition to disease, to the other, by impeding the progress of recovery, and as fresh air is of a first importance in the maintenance of health, so in like manner it is essential in the treatment of disease. Disinfectants have a place in the sick room, they are exceedingly useful in the destruction of the contagium of disease, 17 but this only, when their application can be made in a concentrated form, and in a direct manner, to the objects infected; but it must not be supposed, that their use can under any circumstances be a compensation, for the neglect of an efficient system of ventilation. The vitiated air of the room should be displaced, by a continually flowing current of fresh air, and provision be made for the purpose, in such a manner, that the patient be not subjected to any draught, and yet a free and ample interchange of air, be secured. Although I hold in high appreciation the benefits which have been conferred upon the Metropolis by the advanced policy of the Metropolitan Hoard of Works, yet I cannot view without feelings akin to regret, the action of that Board in regard to the London Sewage and its disinfection. Lambeth is a riparian parish, the waters of the Thames wash its shores, and the waters receding, leave that portion of the Parish, which at high tide is mythical, at ebb tide a sad reality. Can anyone who has an interest in the health of those, who people the riverside districts, view the masses of black slime, pregnant with disease, that disfigure the bank, without the consciousness that such an influence must be produced, that is baneful to the public health in the present, and may have far-reaching effects in the future ? On looking over the weekly death returns on one occasion, my attention was drawn to this peculiar circumstance: a child had received an injury in the W estminster Bridge Road, and was taken to St. Thomas's Hospital, and remained under treatment lor several weeks; the child had recovered from the worst effects of its accident, when it was suddenly seized with illness, and died, its death resulted from diphtheria, enquiries relative to the cause were made, no other patient, in the ward, was suffering from diphtheria, and no one could throw any light upon the manner in which the child had F 18 been infected. A month later a little boy was taken to the Hospital, on account of a rupture, which he had from birth, an operation was performed, the operation was successful; the mother had already made arrangements to remove her child, when the little fellow was taken with diphtheria, and died. Within a period of eight months seven cases of a like nature received into the Hospital, for operation or from accident, died of diphtheria; the origin of that complaint, although enquiries were made, remains a mystery. I communicated with the senior physician of the Hospital, and that gentleman promised a committee of enquiry. Whether the committee ever sat, or if it did sit, what the result was, if any, of the enquiry, I do not know; I have received no communication; the matter had been placed in good hands, and there it was left; but I have always had the impression, and hence the introduction of the circumstance in this place, that the precipitated filth, exposed at low water, at the base of the Hospital, if it was not, should have been, a matter included in that enquiry. But to return to the question of the disposal of the sewage of London. It is a matter which time will decide whether or not, the Board has formed too high an estimate of the value of disinfectants, in arriving at its present determination, to develope the methods of treating sewage, at Crossness, by means of precipitation and the use of chemicals. This scheme is altogether at variance with the decision of the Royal Commissioners, who sat upon this subject, and who recommended the construction of a conduit of such length and capacity that the sewage might be conveyed to some distant place, in order that the river should no longer be used for the purposes of town drainage. But it is the opinion of many, capable from their scientific knowledge of forming a judgment, that whatever amount of 19 disinfection is employed at Crossness, the large and increasing amount of sewage, even after treatment, cannot fail to be a dangerous increment to the river. For even if the Metropolitan I3oard is able to overcome the enormous difficulties with which it has to contend, and succeeds in so treating the effluent, that the river, and the sediment precipitated upon its banks, shall cease to be an anxiety to Londoners, I scarcely think the inhabitants of the Metropolis will forego the hope that the Metropolitan Board of Works, in its wisdom, at some near future shall secure fcr them a river no longer redolent with chemicals and viscid with the deoderizrd effluent from the presses of Crossness, but a stream whose tide, crisp from the sea, shall l>car in the flow, a store of ozone to replenish the impoverished air, and again in the ebb, draw back in its waters, the oxidized impurities of the atmosphere. I have now discussed the principal causes, which in my opinion, aftect the death-rate, but there are many other causes in operation, which have in no small degree contributed to longeMty. The art and science of medicine has advanced with rapid strides during the last forty years, and the wider view taken of disease, the improvement in collateral science, and the more enlightened practice of today, must have been the means of the prolongation of many lives. The Temperance movement, again, has had much influence in the increase of the prosperity, and the health, of the working classes. This, like many other influences, has had an effect alone made possible, by the education conferred upon the masses, as a result of the establishment of the Board Schools. Temperance is one of the elementary principles, in the preservation of health. Anyone who has the health ot the f 2 20 people at heart, must view with satisfaction, the progress that lias been made by this movement, of late years, not only in the lowest, but in all classes of society. Alcohol is not a food, nor should it be an article of daily consumption. In everyday life and in the healthy man, the functions of both mind and body are better performed without its use. It is only of value as a medicine and in certain conditions of the system, but then it should be considered as a medicine; or if, on the other hand, it is used as a daily beverage, it should be acknowledged as an indulgence; when taken in increasing quantities, like the morphia habit, it leads to an early decrepitude. It appears to me, that the leaders of the temperance movement, would be better advised, if, instead of devoting the whole force of their energies, in declaiming against the evils of alcohol, they should make it a first plank in their platform, to obtain for the people, a cheap and pure supply of water. The reformer should strain every fibre of the temperance organization of the metropolis, to attain this result, for assuredly, while the water supply of London, is drawn from a river, whose waters arc polluted, in that part of its course, which lies above the intakes of the Water Companies' mains, by the excrement, and the washings of seventythousand people, whatever amount of filtration the water may undergo, the arguments of the temperance reformer must be strong, indeed, if they induce the people to adopt water as a daily beverage. The death rate in the five great groups of districts is as follows:— West Districts 17.7 per 1000 North Districts 18.0 „ South Districts 19.2 „ East Districts 22.5 „ Central Districts 25.9 „ The following Table shows the mortality, male and female, in the different districts, and a comparison of the deaths in each quarter.

During 1886 there was an increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, the number registered being 240, including 2 strangers, as against 170 in the preceding year. Diarrhoea caused the death of 238 people during the year. Of these 208 occurred in children under 5 years of age, and the remaining 30 being spread through the various age periods,no special periods have a marked incidence; 159 of the deaths of children took place in the first year of life, and 200 of the total deaths took place in the six hotter months of the year. Hence we shall be correct in assuming that fatal diarrhoea, so far as the statistics for the year go to prove, is an infants' complaint, for the most part having its incidence in the hot weather. Many people are under the impression that the increase of mortality from diarrhoea in the summer is due to the larger consumption of fruit, but fruit is an exceptional article in the dietary of children in their first year, and as the majority of deaths occurs during that period of life, fruit, although it may be a cause of diarrhoea, is not commonly a cause of fatal diarrhoea. The summer diarrhoea of children is a specific disease; the attack is sudden in its onset. Vomiting accompanies or precedes its incidence. No food is retained, and in many cases death occurs in twenty-four or forty-eight hours. If, however, the disease does not prove fatal, it runs its course in about fourteen days. The cause of this complaint has been investigated in a large number of cases, and I have arrived at the conclusion that milk, which has undergone a fermentive change, is the cause. The preventative measure which I should recommend to parents, is, that they should not feed children with milk which has not previously been 44 boiled, and, as an inducement, it may be remembered that boiled milk is more readily digested than that which is unboiled, although the contrary is the popular opinion.

The sanitary work carried out in the Parish of Lambeth during the year to which this report refers has been of a satisfactory nature, the number of cases dealt with by the inspectors has exceeded that of any former year. The amount of work which has been accomplished has been more extensive in quantity, as well as more permanent in character, and, as a consequence, more effectual in the improvement of the sanitary condition of the Parish. The former result has been attained by a modification in the routine of the everyday work of the inspector. The labour has been divided and the work specialized. A clerk is occupied with the correspondence, the book-keeping, and the general clerical service of the office, which formerly devolved upon the inspector. The inspector is relieved from duties which can better be performed by the clerk, in consequence he is in possession of a more extended period of time, which he is enabled to devote to the more valuable service for which he has been especially trained, and to accomplish that, which, under the previous organization, would not have been possible: the latter effect has been derived from an altered system of inspection. Formerly, unless under unusual and exceptional circumstances, houses were net visited, nor works for their sanitary improvement carried out without a formal complaint of an existing nuisance had been made, or without something had happened which had led the sanitary inspector to believe that his presence in that place was required ; but at the present time, within the divisions of the parish to which the duties 48 of the several inspectors appertain, districts are mapped out comprising the streets in which the poor are congregated, and the remainder of the time which the sanitary inspector has at his disposal, when the other duties of the day are completed, is spent in carrying into effcct those improvements in the drainage and water supply, which may he found necessary when passing from house to house in the prescribed district. Formerly the inspector considered that his duty had been fulfilled, when he had abated the nuisance for the remedy of which his attendance had been required; for example, after the occurrence of a case of fever, when disinfection had been carried out, and when the premises had been cleansed, he considered that his duty in respect to that house was at an end. But he does not now consider that his duty has been discharged, although those matters have been completed to his satisfaction, until the condition of the drainage and water supply have been examined, and until all structural defects in these systems have been remedied and the house placed in a sanitary condition. It may be observed that in this manner, during the last few years, and especially during last year, a considerable increase has taken place in the sanitary works which are of a permanent character, and which must result ultimately in a more healthy state of the parish.
