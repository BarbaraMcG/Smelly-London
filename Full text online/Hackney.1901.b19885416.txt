OFFICER'S REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1901. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Town Hall, Hackney, N.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Hackney. Gentlemen, In presenting my Annual Report on the Health of the Borough of Hackney for the year 1901, I am pleased to state that in spite of the prevalence of infectious disease during a great part of the year, the general death.rate was remarkably low, viz., 15.9 per 1000. Not since the year 1894 has the annual death.rate been so low. The zymotic death.rate was equally satisfactory being 2.2 per 1000 while the rate for all London was 2.6 per 1000 living. The year showed also a decline in the infant mortality, the rate for the Borough being 107.4 per 1000 births while that of all London equalled 149 per 1000 births. 4 The marriage.rate showed a slight increase upon that for 1900, but the birth.rate was slightly less than that of the previous year. Although the population and density of the Borough is increasing year by year, it may be regarded with justice as one of the healthiest of the London Districts. Further on in this report reference is made to the work of the Public Health Department in the detection and abatement of nuisances and the prevention of the extension of infectious disease. This work has been very satisfactory during the year, so that I have no hesitation in stating that on the whole the Sanitary Inspectors and the other Officers of the Department have performed the duties allotted to them with zeal and to my satisfaction. Population and Density.—Taking the rate of increase of the population during the last decennium, as recorded in the Census of April, 1901, as a basis, I calculate the population of Hackney at the middle of 1901 to be 219,780 persons. With a total area of 3292 square acres, the density equals 66.7 persons per acre. The following table shows the same facts for the different sub.districts of the Borough:— Showing estimated Population, A rea and Density of the Registration Sub.Districts in Hackney, at middle of 1902. North. Central. South West. South East. Total for Hackney Total for London.

A more accurate estimation may be obtained from the following table taken from the Census of last year. This shows the total number of tenements occupied in the Borough, with those tenements of four rooms and under, and their number of occupants:— Table Total Tenements, and, Tenements of less than 5 Rooms in Hackney, 1901.

The above total of 3,663 overcrowded tenements, which amounts to nearly 8 per cent. of the total enumerated tenements in the Borough, agrees closely with the estimate of 8 per cent made in my report to the Council last year, on the Housing of the Working Classes in Hackney. Taking the acreage of the Borough to be 3,289 acres, and the population 219,763, the density is equivalent to 66.8 persons per acre. The density varies in the different sub.districts from 44.7 per acre in the North sub.district to 99 6 per acre in the South.West sub.district. *Marriages.—The marriages solemnized in the Borough of Hackney during the year reached the number 1,756. This is an increase of 72 on the number for the previous year. The marriage.rate for 1901 is 15.9 per 1,000 persons living. The marriage.rate for all London for the same period is 17.6 per 1,000. Births.—The births registered in the Borough during the year 1901 reached the total of 6,318, of which 3,192 were males and 3,126 females. The annual birth.rate therefore, for the Borough is 28'7 per 1,000 living persons, varying from 21.1 per 1,000 in North Hackney, to 31.6 per 1,000 in South.West Hackney. The birth.rate for the whole district shows a slight decrease upon that of the previous year, which was 29.0 per 1,000 living. The birth.rate for all London during 1901 is 29 0 per 1,000 living. 7 Table. Births. Registration District of Hackney. Registration Sub-Districts. All London North Central South West South East Total No. of Births 6,318 1,072 1,530 1,898 1,818 131,278 Bate per 1,000 living 28.7 21.1 30.1 31.6 31.1 290 No. of Illegitimate Births 133 Bate per 1,000 Births 21 *Illegitimacy.—The illegitimate births registered in the Borough during the year numbered 356. Of this number 223 took place in the Salvation Army Rescue Homes established in the district, 5 of them only being of Hackney parentage. The actual number occurring amongst Hackney residents is therefore 133. This gives an illegitimate birth-rate of 21 per 1,000 births. Deaths.—The deaths registered in the district during 1901 totalled 3,634; but of this total 463 deaths were of persons from outside districts dying in institutions in the Borough, and in addition, 326 residents of Hackney died in institutions in other districts. Making the necessary corrections, the nett deaths belonging to Hackney amounted during the year to 3,497, which is equivalent to a death-rate of 15.9 per 1,000 living persons. Correcting this rate for age and sex distribution by means of the factor 1.04645, the true mortality for Hackney for the year is 16.6 per 1,000. This shows an improvement on the rate for 1900, which was 17.4 per 1,000 living. The mortality rate for all London for the same period is 18.79 per 1,000 living. Infant Mortality.—The number of children who died during the year in the Borough under one year of age was 871. This is equivalent to an infant mortality of 107.4 per 1,000 births. Below is given a table showing the chief causes of infant mortality. The infant mortality for all London for the same period is 149 per 1,000 births *1 have here to acknowledge my indebtedness to Sir. Tom Osgood, Superintendent Registrar, who has kindly abstracted for me the number of marriages and illegitimate births for the year 1901. 8 Table.—Eleven principal causes of Infant Mortality. 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 Measles 19 3 35 24 15 32 25 29 12 22 Scarlatina 4 4 2 3 6 7 4 2 2 — Whooping Cough 41 68 25 29 61 36 44 22 50 21 Teething 21 22 18 23 19 11 17 16 6 14 Diarrhæa 86 103 58 141 171 151 160 165 181 130 Convulsions 99 127 86 104 93 72 72 70 80 68 Lung Diseases 152 162 133 151 137 142 131 150 136 129 Tubercular Diseases 66 84 53 31 57 55 61 56 73 69 Atrophy and Debility 174 109 144 125 101 131 136 134 128 121 Premature Birth 109 105 81 99 110 118 145 124 130 124 Accidents & Violence 28 26 31 34 27 26 34 36 30 26 Total 799 878 666 767 826 781 829 804 828 724 Other Causes 113 167 136 209 184 198 213 265 207 147 Total 912 1045 802 976 1010 979 1042 1069 1035 871 Senile Mortality.— The deaths registered from the age of 65 and upwards numbered 766, and is equivalent to a mortality of 3.7 per 1,000 living; ?64 deaths being between the ages of 65 and 75; 321 between the ages of 75 and 85 years, and 81 at 85 years and upwards. SPECIFIC CAUSES OF DEATH. Class I. Specific Febrile or Zymotic Diseases.—The deaths from these diseases during 1901 numbered 504, against 575 during the year 1900. The zymotic death-rate is 2.2 per 1,000 living, against 2.6 for 1900. The zymotic mortality for all London for 1901 is 2.68 per 1,000 living. A.—NOTIFIABLE DISEASES. Small Pox.—The Borough was free from this disease during the first six months of the year 1901; but in the month of July the disease was introduced by the occurrence of two cases at a local laundry. One of them was the carman who fetched the soiled linen 9 from the customers to the laundry, the other was a woman who sorted the linen as it arrived before being washed. These cases led to several others amongst their own families, but no farther extension amongst the employes of the laundry. The source of infection of the first two cases could not be definitely fixed upon; but there is no doubt that these two persons were infected by dirty and infected linen, brought to the laundry to be cleaned. In the month of August the disease was again introduced and gradually obtained a hold upon the inhabitants of Hackney. Up to the end of December a total of 49 cases was notified, but of these eight were sent home from the hospital as not suffering from smallpox, thus leaving a total of 41 genuine cases of small.pox for the year. The following is a list of the cases notified:— CASES OP SMALL.POX NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR 1901. Date. Address Name. Age. Date of Removal. lst July 43, Retreat Place — E.

William G. 21 21 „ Amongst these oases a very noteworthy one was that of Charlotte W. of 8, Sanford Lane. This woman fell ill on the 8th December and a rash appeared on her body two days after. A medical practitioner was called in to see her and he diagnosed the case as one of food poisoning. For seven days the woman was treated for this affection, but on the seventh day I was asked by her medical attendant to see her. The case was a well marked one of small-pox, and before she could be removed to hospital the woman died. Owing to the mistake in diagnosis, a large number of the woman's friends and neighbours visited her, the result being that no less than 24 individuals were ultimately infected, either directly or indirectly, by this one case. This one incident shows how much may be done to prevent the spread-of small-pox by early recognition of its nature and removal to hospital, and on the contrary how much mischief may be brought about by a mistaken diagnosis. Amongst the 41 cases notified were five deaths, giving a mortality rate of 10.2 per cent. of those attacked, and .02 per 1,000 living. 11 TABLE OF DEATHS Of Inhabitants of the Hackney District between 1st Jan. and 31st Dec., 1901.

This is an increase of 269 on the number notified during 1900 and gives an attack rate of 4.2 per 1,000 living. The deaths from this disease recorded during the year numbered 23 and are equal to a death rate of 2.4 per cent. attacked and .11 per 1,000 living. Of the total notified 716 or 76 per cent. were removed to hospital. The disease was wide spread over the district but did not appear to be associated in any marked manner with school attendance or milk supplies. One small outbreak occurred in an institution, the Salvation Army Home for Mothers and Children, Upper Springfield, Clapton. Seventeen cases occurred here within the space of a week, the original source of infection being one of the inmates who fell ill with a mild attack of scarlet fever which remained unrecognised until several other inmates had been attacked. By removal to hospital of all cases as soon as attacked and the isolation of suspected cases, together with the usual measures of disinfection, the outbreak was confined to comparatively narrow limits and brought to an end. On reference to the chart furnished with this report, it will be seen that there is a sudden rise in the notifications in the last week of July. This rise above the average is almost entirely due to the above mentioned outbreak. The disease was at its maximum prevalence in the month of October and at its minimum during the months of January, February, March and April. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—During the year 989 cases of diphtheria and 17 membranous croup were notified. Of these 28 were subsequently found not to be suffering from this disease, the total notified cases being thus reduced to 961. This is equal to an attack rate of 4 3 per 1,000 living. The deaths numbered 95, which is equivalent to a mortality of 9.8 per cent. on those attacked and .43 per 1,000 living persons. The disease was at its lowest point of prevalence during the first three months of the year. In the 20 following month a rise took place which was maintained with short remissions until it reached its highest point in the first week of December. Of the total number notified 699 were removed to hospital, which is equal to over 76 per cent. of the whole. During the year 35 samples of material from the throats of suspected diphtheria cases were examined at the Jenner Institution, at the cost of the local authority. Anti-toxin serum to the number of 30 bottles have been supplied to medical practitioners of the district during the same period. Enteric ok Typhoid Fever.—This disease was slightly less prevalent in the borough during 1901 than during the previous year the numbers notified during the respective years being 196 and 219, Of the total notified, 142 or 72 per cent. were removed to hospital and out of this number 13 were sent home again as not suffering from the disease, thus reducing the genuine notified cases to 183, which is equivalent to an attack rate of .8 per 1000 of the population. On investigation of the notified cases as to the source of infection, it was ascertained that 8 cases had been infected outside the borough during visits to other districts. The total deaths from this disease numbered 22, which is equal to a mortality of 12 per cent. attacked, and .1 per mille of the population. The largest number of cases occurred in the S.E. district of the borough. The disease was at its height during the month of September, and its lowest point in the month of February Samples of blood from suspected cases were sent to the Jenner Institute to the number of 9. Typhus.—This disease did not appear in the borough during 1901. Continued Fever.— One case was notified under this name during the year. 1901. SCARLET FEVER, DIPHTHERIA AND TYPHOID FEVER. 21 Puerperal Fever.—Seventeen cases of puerperal fever were notified during 1901, of which 7 died. The mortality is equivalent to 41 per cent. of cases attacked. The attack rate per 1000 births is 2.6, and the mortality per 1000 births 1.1. Plague.—Fortunately this disease did not appear in Hackney during 1901. Erysipelas.—There was a large increase of cases of this diseast in the borough during 1901, no less than 324 being notified againse 230 in 1900. Of the total notified, 49 were removed to some general Hospital. The deaths numbered 15, which is equivalent to a mortality rate of 4.6 per cent of those attacked, and 0.06 per 1000 living. Chicken-Pox.—Owing to the absence of small-pox from London for many years, its differential diagnosis from chicken-pox was not so well-known as was desirable, the result being that in the early stages of the small-pox epidemic of last year several cases of small-pox were mistaken for chicken-pox and the reverse. Under these circumstances it was thought desirable by the Public Health Committee to make chicken-pox a notifiable disease. This was done by a resolution of the Borough Council on the 28th November, 1901, which came into effect on the 1st January, 1902. Experience has justified the wisdom of this step, for owing to the notification of chicken-pox several cases of small-pox have been discovered which would probably have led to an extension of the disease. B.—NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Influenza.—This disease was less fatal during 1901 than the year before, the deaths in these years being respectively 38 and 83. The former number is equivalent to a death rate of 0.17 per 1000 living. The deaths were distributed in the months of the year as below. 22 Deaths from Influenza during the years 1891 to 1900. Year.

This is equivalent to a mortality of .76 per 1000 living. In addition to the In addition to the above, there were 77 deaths from enteritis, of which 56 were under one year of age.

Of these 80 occurred under the age of five years. The mortality for the year is .4 per 1000 living. Whooping Cough.—This disease was not so fatal in the borough during 1901 as the year before. The deaths numbered 49 against 109 in 1900. Of the total deaths last year 48 occurred under the age of five years. The mortality for the year is .22 per 1000. 23 Class II. Constitutional Diseases—Tuberculous Disease. —The deaths from this cause during the year numbered 499, which is equivalent to an annual mortality of 2.2 per 1,000 living. Below is a table showing the number of deaths from the various forms of this disease during the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive.

It is through their agency that a rational public opinion may be formed, the duties of public health officers made easier of performance, and such local and state legislation as may be requisite called into existence. 8—That this Congress is of opinion that a permanent International Committee should be appointed—(a) to collect evidence and report on the measures that have been adopted for the prevention of tuberculosis in different countries; (b) to publish a popular statement of these measures; (c) to keep and publish periodically a record of scientific research in relation to tuberculosis; (d) to consider and recommend measures of prevention. This Congress is further of opinion, that all international and great national societies whose object is the prevention of tuberculosis should be invited to co-operate. 9—That in the opinion of this Congress, overcrowding, defective ventilation, damp and general insanitary conditions in tho houses of the working classes, diminish the chance of curing consumption and aid in predisposing to and spreading the disease. 25 10—That the following question be submitted for the consideration of the next Congress on tuberculosis: The constitutional conditions of the individual which predispose to tuberculosis, and the means by which they may be modified. 11—That while recognising the great importance of sanatoria in combating tuberculosis in all countries, the attention of Government should be directed to informing charitable and philanthropic individuals and societies of the necessity for anti-tubercular dispensaries as the best means of checking tubercular disease among the industrial and indigent classes. Owing to the attitude of Prof. Koch of Berlin, who read a paper to the Congress in which he doubted that bovine and human tuberculosis were the same disease, and that animals and man can be reciprocally infected by it, uncertainty has been caused in the mind of the public as to whether the measures hitherto taken to guard the public from the transmission of tuberculosis through meat and milk are necessary. In order to set this at rest his Majesty's Government have appointed a Commission to report on this subject. It is to be hoped their report will soon be made and be final. Cancer.—Cancer was the cause of 182 deaths during the year, which is equivalent to a mortality of .82 per 1,000 living. Class III. Developmental.—The deaths in this class numbered 345, of which 124 were attributed to premature birth. Class IV. Local Diseases.—Local diseases are responsible for 1,540 deaths during the year. This is equivalent to a death-rate of 7.0 per 1,000 living. 26 Class V. Violence.—There were 138 deaths during the year which were caused by violence. The annual mortality is 6 2 yer 1,000 living. Class VI. Ill-Defined Causes.—There were 172 deaths attributed to ill. defined causes during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. Nuisances.—During the year 1901 the inspectors made 8,308 primary inspections for the discovery of nuisances. These inspections have included various kinds of premises. In addition, 38,374 re-inspections have been made either during the progress of work executed for the purpose of abating or preventing the recurrence of nuisances, or to see if such work has been commenced. The nuisances abated during the year amounted to 4,257. Most of these were abated on the service of intimation and statutory notices only ; but it was necessary to initiate legal proceedings in 88 cases. The result of these proceedings is recorded in the appendix. House to House Inspection.—This form of inspection has pro. ceeded satisfactorily during the year, no less than 1,426 having been made. Most of these have been made in the Homerton district, and has led to the discovery of many nuisances. The nuisances found on inspection were in great part abated by the end of the year. Infectious Disease.—Ths number of inspections made after the notifications of infectious disease was much larger, owing, of course, to the greater prevalence of infectious disease, than during the previous year, reaching the number of 2,325. In each of these inspections the house drains were thoroughly tested, and any nuisance found on the premises abated. 27 The rooms disinfected reached the large number of 2,374; those cleansed, i.e., those in which the walls were stripped of their paper and washed with carbolic solution, 734. Disinfectants were issued to the public during the year to the number of 980 bottles of carbolic acid, and 6,453 one pound bags of sanitas powder. The articles disinfected at the Borough Disinfecting Stations with super-heated steam amounted to 14,960, and the articles destroyed, mostly on the request of the owners, to 80. Further details are given in the appendix. Accommodation for persons during the disinfection of their houses was paid for by the local authority in one case. This will no longer be necessary, as we are now provided with a shelter for such emergencies. Articles Seized Unfit for Food.— These amounted during the year to 24 cwts. of fish; 1 cwt. of meat; 11¼ cwt. of fruit and vegetables; 102 tins of tinned food, and 2¼ cwt. of other articles. Cow-Houses and Slaughter-Houses.—The annual inspection of these premises (31 slaughter-houses and 25 cow-houses) by the Public Health Committee took place in the month of September. On the whole these premises were found to be in a satisfactory condition; but the following conditions were found requiring attention : Foul grain pit 2 Dirty sheep pen 1 Dirty dairy 1 Paving defective 3 Dirty cow-house 4 28 I may here add that since the supervision of slaughter-houses and cow-houses have been transferred by the London County Council to the Borough, the premises have been inspected once a month by the inspectors. Bake-Houses.—The annual inspection of these by the Public Health Committee took place in the month of June. The following is a summary of the results of inspection:— Bake-houses inspected 119 In satisfactory condition 87 Requiring cleansing 17 „ repairs 15 Notices were served for the cleansing and repairs which were immediately executed. Smoke Nuisances.—During the year 1754 observations were made by the Smoke Inspector and 78 intimations and statutory notices were serves for the abatement of this nuisance. The nuisances were abated without further legal proceeeings. STORM FLOODINGS. On the 27th July, 1901, an excessive fall of rain took place in the borough, resulting in the surcharging of certain sewers of the district, and the flooding with sewage of a large number of houses in certain low-lying parts of the districts. The places chiefly affected were Clapton Park and Hackney Wick. I immediately took steps, in conjunction with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, to have the flooded houses put into a proper habitable condition. Below is a table showing the streets and houses affected, and particulars of the measures taken with their cost: 29 Graham Road 101, 104, 106, 108, 110, 120, 124, 128, 174 The floors were taken up in basement, and the accumulation of sewage, mud, &c., removed; the surface under the floors was covered with lime and disinfecting powder; the floors were then re-laid with old materials where possible, new boards having to be used in some cases where the old boards and joists were too rotten to be used again.

The following is a list of the additional workshops registered during the year. The total number was 99; of these 9 were workshops in which males were employed, and 90 where females were employed. The former were inspected by the male Sanitary Inspectors, the latter by Miss Teebay. Any nuisances found were all satisfactorily abated. The total number of workshops now on the register is 1727 and is increasing every year. If these are to be inspected once or more during the year an increase in the inspectorial staff will be necessary if other important work has not to be neglected No. of Workshops registered during the year 1901 99 „ „ inspected on notice by Factory Inspector 28 „ „ „ by instructions of Medical Officer of Health 2 Result of Inspections:—(a) Workshops overcrowded 6 (b) Improper W.C.

The Canal Boats Inspector's reports that during the year he made 71 visits to the canals passing through the district, and 100 inspections and two re-inspections of boats. He found 96 of these boats conforming to the Acts and Regulations, but on board four he observed infringements of the Regulations. These were as follows :— Dilapidations 3 Marking 1 Separation of Sexes 1 Painting of Cabin 3 31 CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1900. During the year I granted five certificates for exemption of inhabitated house duty under the provisions of this Act. The number of tenements covered by the certificates was 14. VACCINATION. The following table is a summary of the returns made by Vaccination Officers of the district for the first six months of the year 1901. It appears from this that out of a total of 3,166 births only 1,372 were successfully vaccinated. This is equal to a little over 43 per cent. of the births of the year. These figures show a slight improvement on the percentage of successful vaccinations for the corresponding half of the year 1900, the latter showing 40 per cent. successfully vaccinated. For many years this neglect of vaccination has continued, and for years I have directed attention to it, and forcasted the occurrence of an epidemic of small-pox unless vaccination became more general. In another part of this report, it will be seen that the Borough was visited in July last by an outbreak of small-pox which has continued up to the present time. I do not expect that the disease will cease in the Borough until vaccination is more generally and efficiently done, or until the susceptible material, i.e. unvaccinated, is almost exhausted. 32 Return made on the 8th February, 1902, by the Vaccination Officers of the Hackney Union, respecting the Vaccination of Children whose Births were registered in their Districts from 1st January to 30th June, 1901, inclusive.

On receipt of a copy of this resolution, I recommended the Hackney Local Authority to take advantage of the School Board's offer and to have such of the children attending the Boards Schools in the Borough, whose parents did not object, examined, in order to get those vaccinated who were found unprotected. The Council in consequence passed the following resolution:— "That the Medical Officer of Health be authorised to have all the children and young persons whose parents raise no objection, attending the Board Schools in the Borough examined by a medical man, as to whether they have been vaccinated or otherwise, and to prepare and present a report to the Borough Council as to the result of his examination, and that the consent of the Council be obtained thereto." In the appendix to this annual report will be found my report on the examination of the children. In that report I divided the children into those vaccinated and those unvaccinalted. Here I wish to make some further remarks upon the number 9249 found vaccinated. The following table which I have prepared further classifies the children into those with only one, two, three, four or five and more vaccination marks. It will be seen that there were 9.7% of the total with only one mark; 17.5% with two marks; 24.4% with three marks; 40.9% with four marks; and 7.3% with five marks and upwards.

This is due largely to the fact, that each private practitioner has an opinion of his own as to what constitutes efficient vaccination. In a great many cases the opinion of the child's parent determines the amount and character of the vaccinated area. This is much to be regretted; and some portion of responsibility for the present outbreak in London, rests upon those practitioners who to please patients or their parents vaccinated in only one or two places. I repeat here, as stated in the report referred, that vaccination being of national concern, should be subject to such regulations that one standard of efficient vaccination should be universal. Every practitioner should be a public vaccinator in the sense that he should be paid for his vaccinations as the present public vaccinators, and should be under the same control as to efficiency, etc.; vaccination and re-vaccination should also be compulsory. Until these alterations are made in the law of vaccination, we shall still, in my opinion, have recurring outbreaks of small-pox. THE RIVER LEA. The following analysis of samples of Lea water made during the summer of last year show the continued and increasing pollution the water is receiving, The constitution of a new Lea Conservancy Board appeared to hold out prospects of some attempt to alter the condition of the river Lea as it passes through Hackney, but up to the present no improvement has taken place. 36 Analysis of River Lea Water, made during the year 1901, by Leo Taylor, F.I.C., Public Analyst.

During the twelve months ending December, 1901, the contractors removed from the Borough and disposed of 59,546 loads of house refuse—each load averaging two cubic yards—at a cost of £15,250 19s. 0d. The corresponding numbers for the previous year, 1900, were 61,164 loads at a cost of £15,663 14s. 0d., which shows a decreased expenditure on the removal of dust for the year 1901 of £412 15s. 0d. This decrease needs further explanation. In the natural course of events, it is expected that with an increasing number of inhabited houses the amount of house refuse requiring removal would pari passu increase. Table.

During his suspension, I became aware of the existence of many irregularities which had arisen amongst the Council's dustmen as well as the Contractor's own men, due to improper supervision by the Superintendent, such as the removal of much trade refuse, and a certain amount of false packing of the 41 vans. In order to control this, after the dismissal of several dustmen and the suspension of others, I resolved to appoint a second Dust Superintendent, so that there would be a Superintendent to each division. The result of this action has been to reduce the expenditure of the Council for dust removal during the last five months of 1901 to the extent of over £900. I may add that this saving is still continuing, and that in the course of a year the saving should be little short of £2,000. The following table gives the number of requests to remove the dust received during the year compared with previous years. They amount to an average of three per week, a very small number compared with the number of inhabited houses in the borough. Table.

WALTER JOHNSON, Mayor. 46 APPENDIX. REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health on the Examination of the arms of the children attending the London Board Schools in the Borough with respect to their state of Vaccination. Resolution:—"That the Medical Officer of Health be authorised to have all the children and young persons, whose parents raise no objection, attending the Board Schools in the Borough, examined by a medical man as to whether they have been vaccinated or otherwise' and to prepare and present a report to the Borough Council as to the result of his examination." Gentlemen, In reporting upon your instruction, I have in the first place briefly to describe the circumstances which led up to the instruction. Owing to the appearance of cases of small-pox in increasing and threatening numbers in certain Boroughs of the Metropolis, the London School Board, after certain representations had been made to them from the Local Government Board, passed the following resolution:— "That facilities be given to the Public Vaccination Officers of the Metropolis, on the application of the proper local Authority, to enter the Schools of the Board in infected areas, for the purpose of examining the arms of the children, with a view to advising the parents to allow their children to be vaccinated, provided that the School Board issue a circular to the parents of the children asking if they have any objection to this examination, and, in case of such objection in any particular case, that such examination shall not take place; and the Local Government Board, and the Public Vaccination Officers be informed accordingly." A copy of this resolution, together with a copy of a letter drafted for distribution to the parents or guardians of the scholars, in order 47 to obtain their consent to the examination, were forwarded to the Hackney Borough Council, and referred to the Public Health Committee for consideration and report. The Public Health Committee having ascertained by consultation with representatives of the Board of Guardians, that the latter did not intend to take any steps to enquire as to the number of unvaccinated children in the Borough, resolved to recommend the Council to use the facilities offered by the London School Board, to ascertain the amount and character of the vaccination amongst the children in their schools in the Borough; and accordingly reported in the terms of the above resolution to the Council. My first intention was to obtain if possible the assistance of the Public Vaccinators in the examination of the children : hut as I became aware of a strong feeling on the part of a certain portion of the Guardians against the public Vaccinators assisting in this work, and as it would take them from the more important work of vaccination and re-vaccination, I resolved to obtain outside medical help; and accordingly without any difficulty, obtained the services of three Medical Practitioners for this purpose. The following Table (I.) shews the number of children on the rolls of the different Board Schools in the Hackney Borough, together with the number of refusals to the examination, and the percentage of refusals to scholars on the roll. It will be seen that the average number of refusals for the 26 schools was 48 per cent., individual schools varying from 30 per cent. to 71 per cent. The causes of this variation are no doubt various, but one or two circumstances stand out prominently as contributing to increase the number of refusals. Looking at the following table it will be seen that the Schools with the largest number of refusals are situated in Hackney Wick and Homerton, localities occupied by classes whose actions are largely prompted by impulse and sentiment; but it is evident, that even in these localities some special agency TABLE I.

The following effusion which was distributed broadcast explains the influence at work, and also illustrates the mental strength of the classes moved by it:— LONDON SCHOOL BOARD'S CHILDREN AND VACCINATION. PARENTS, do not allow your Children to be inspected by the Public Vaccinators. There is no law to compel you. KEEP THE CHILDREN AWAY FROM SCHOOL rather than run the risk of their being poisoned with filth taken from animals, which the Doctors call Vaccine, the evil effects of which they themselves do not understand. Parents, will you allow your Children to be made ill and liable to take diseases, in order to allow some Doctors to have good positions and well-lined purses ? REMEMBER, a large number of the Doctors themselves are against Vaccination. ABOLISH THE FILTHY PRACTICE ALTOGETHER. When the circular, announcing the examination reaches you, send in your notice of objection, so that the authorities may learn how strongly the people object to these measures for forcing Vaccination upon them. Further reference to this production is unnecessary, except to state that I have included it in my report as a sample of the statements made by those opposed to vaccination. Another cause for the refusals arises from the fact, that a large number of parents did not understand the object of signing the School Board's letter of objection to the examination. Many Masters and Mistresses were of the same opinion. 53 Reference to Table II. will show the number of scholars examined in the Board Schools of the Borough, together with those found un-vaccinated. The total number examined was 12,890, and amongst these 3,641 were found unvaccinated, which is equivalent to a percentage of over 28. The percentage of un-vaccinated varied considerably in the different departments of the Schools; in the Boys' Department the un-vaccinated averaged 22.8 per cent. of those examined, in the Girls' 20.5 per cent., and in the Infants' 45.19 per cent; the ages of the children in the Boys' and Girls' Departments range from 8 to 15 years; the Infants' from 3 to 8 years. It is only during the last 8 or 9 years that vaccination has been so much neglected. The uncertainty, arising from the appointment of the Royal Commission on Small-pox, caused immediately a slackness in the application of the Vaccination Laws by Boards of Guardians, and a corresponding increase of indifference on the part of the public; the nett result being that children grew up without being vaccinated, and this neglect has continued up to the present time. In Table I. it may be seen that the number of refusals amounted to 15,016. It may fairly well be assumed, that the percentage of un-vaccinated amongst these is much higher, than amongst those examined, because really, the objection to being examined could not rise from the sentimental objection of the arm being bared, but from the possible consequence arising from the discovery of an un-vaccinated condition; and it was the opinion of several masters and mistresses, that the majority of those, who declined to be examined, were un-vaccinated. Now, deducting 12,893 which were examined from the total on the roll of the schools, we get 18,100 children who were not examined. I am of opinion from the reason above stated that at least 50 per cent. of these are un-vaccinated. Now all of these children are over 3 years of age; and as to the condition of the children in the Borough under 3 years with respect to vaccination, I find from the Vaccination Returns for the last 54 three years, that the number of children born during these years was 19,257, and of these about 38 per cent. escaped vaccination which amounts to over 7,000 children. In order to obtain an idea of the number of un-vaccinated children in the Borough, it will only be necessary to apply the rate, I have above determined, from the examination of the Board School children between the ages of 3 and 14 years, to the whole of the children in the Borough at these ages. This latter I have ascertained to be not less than 47,800; and 28 per cent. of this number will give 13,384; adding to this 7,000 under 3 years of age, we get the total of 23,384 un-vaccinated children in the Borough at the present time. This is very probably an under-estimate; because, as I stated before, the children whom we did not examine, would probably show a higher un-vaccinated percentage than those examined. A more detailed analysis of the percentage amongst the children examined is contained in Table III. It will be seen from this, that the percetnage of un-vaccinated, between the ages of 3 and 14 years varies from 47.73 to 4.77 per cent.; and that there is almost an unbroken increase of the percentage from the age of 14 years downward. If these figures show anything, it is that 14 years ago vaccination was well done, and that the community was a well vaccinated one; also, that from that date some influence began to operate, which year by year led to a less proportion of the children born being vaccinated, until five years ago, when the high percentage of 47.75 per cent. of children born escaped vaccination; this proportion being practically maintained during the two following years. This report is concerned only with children of 3 years and over. Of the younger children who do not go to school, we have seen above, that the number of un-vaccinated amongst them amounts to about 38 per cent. Such is the state of the child population of Hackney and their preparedness to resist an increase of small-pox. As to the causes which have led up to the present un-vaccinated condition of the infant population of Hackney, these are not far to seek. 55 Freedom from small-pox for a number of years has produced with the public generally a feeling of security, which a more accurate knowledge of the disease fails to justify. The natural tendency of humanity is to think little of a danger which is remote, and consequently a feeling that it is unnecessary to take any precaution against it. It is only when Small-pox is actually in their midst that they lose indifference; then, a panic-stricken desire to protect themselves and their children is manifested; but usually the change of mind comes too late, and many innocent children are sacrificed or maimed for life through the indifference of their parents. The propaganda of those, who are opposed to vaccination entirely, has helped to increase the feeling of the public generally, that the operation is unnecessary; but the most important factor, in my opinion, in bringing about the present un-vaccinated condition of the infant population, was the appointment of a Royal Commission which did not report finally until 7 years after its appointment. Naturally, the existing uncertainty must have been very much increased by the appointment of a commission to enquire into the subject of vaccination at all; how much more must that have increased, and with it the resolution on the part of the public to have nothing to do with the operation, as year after year passed, and no sign of a decided opinion in favour of vaccination came from the commission. It cannot be wondered at that the public hesitated when so much delay and hesitation was shown by the Royal Commission, nor that the public continued to hesitate, when the Government promoted the Act of 1898. The question naturally arises, can anything be done to successfully alter this state of affairs? The condition of the public with respect to vaccination is much worse now than before the Royal Commission on Small-pox was appointed. Their report, which was a conclusive testimony of the value of vaccination and re-vaccination, had no effect upon a public, which had been allowed, during seven years, to lapse into a condition of torpor on this subject. 56 The obvious duty for the Government at this time is to reconsider this question of vaccination and re-vaccination, not by any more Royal Commissions, but by the introduction of a compulsory law both for vaccination and re-vaccination. In addition to this, certain other changes must be made. In the first place, the Vaccination Authority must be changed. Apart from the fact that a large number of Boards of Guardians have neglected their duty in this respect, it is an anomaly, that while the duty of taking measures for controlling the spread of every other infectious disease is under the control of the Sanitary Authority, the chief measure for preventing the spread of small-pox, i.e., efficient vaccination and re-vaccination, is left to the Guardians. The Borough Councils in London are the authorities, to whom should be entrusted the duty of executing the vaccination laws, because they are already entrusted with the execution of all other preventive measures relating to small-pox; and both economy and efficiency would be attained by uniting all preventive measures against the spread of infectious diseases under one authority. In addition to the above, I am of opinion, that it would be of great advantage in making vaccination more popular and more thorough, if the following alterations were made in the vaccination laws:— (a) In the first place, I think that private practitioners should be placed on the same footing with respect to the vaccination: of their private patients as the Public Vaccinator. That is to say, that every vaccination or re-vaccination done by a private practitioner should be done at the public expense, the lymph being also supplied from the Government laboratories. Of course the private practitioner should be paid for this service at the same rate as the Public Vaccinators; but on the other hand the private practitioner should be controlled by the Local Government Board's Orders respecting vaccination, especially those referring to the number, size, and total area of the vaccination marks. If this change were made, I feel certain we should soon have a well vaccinated public. To a large number 57 of persons of limited income, who do not care to call in the Public Vaccinator, the expense of being re-vaccinated by their private practitioner is a deterrent to the operation being done, unless the danger is very imminent; besides, during epidemic times, the number of persons requiring re-vaccination can be more promply dealt with, than under the present system. Another point which needs consideration is that relating to the supply of lymph. I have been asked by several medical practitioners, if I could recommend them a good lymph, as certain of the varieties of lymph in the market have failed to "take" when used for vaccination. At one public establishment, where all the inmates were revaccinated with a certain quality of lymph, not one of the cases re-acted; and generally a certain amount of dissatisfaction has been expressed, as to the quality of lymph from private sources. Vaccination being a national concern, all lymph should be prepared under the supervision of Government Officers. No lymph, except that which has been supervised during its preparation by such officers, should be allowed under penalties to be used in this country. This would ensure all lymph being of an uniform standard. Again, I have had applications made to me during the present outbreak of small-pox in London, by certain factory proprietors in the Borough, to send the Public Vaccinator to their establishments to re-vaccinate certain of their employes, who wished the operation done. In practice it is found that the Public Vaccinator cannot do all these re-vaccinations, because many of the persons live out of the district to which the Public Vaccinator has been appointed. Some arrangement should be made to meet such cases; it is obviously of advantage that such cases should be dealt 58 with by the Public Vaccinator, or indeed by any medical practitioner at the expense of the public: because such an arrangement would lead to an economy of time, on the part of those who are to be re-vaccinated, and on the part of the Vaccinators. In conclusion, I have to put on record my appreciation of the courteous assistance rendered to me during my enquiry by all the Masters and Mistresses of the Board Schools visited. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, J. KING WARRY, M.D., M.R.C.P., Medical Officer of Health. THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF HACKNEY. THE BOROUGH COUNCIL. REPORT ON THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES IN HACKNEY. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, The provision of "proper" house accommodation for all classes of the community is essential for its healthy growth; and by the term "proper" is meant not only a dwelling which is structurally sanitary, with healthy surroundings, but also an absence of such overcrowding among its inmates as would cause danger or injury to their health. The evils of insanitary dwellings and surroundings, and the importance of removing them, have long been recognised by the public. Much progress in the improvement of insanitary conditions has been made in Hackney during the last eight or nine years under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Housing 59 of the Working Classes Act, 1890, particulars of which may be found in my Annual Reports for these years; but the importance of controlling overcrowding has not received all the attention which we shall see it deserves, when we consider some of its results. Something, however, has been done in Hackney in registering a certain number of tenement dwellings under the Bye-laws for houses let in lodgings, and causing these to be periodically inspected. It is well known that overcrowding has a general prejudicial effect upon the constitution, rendering it more vulnerable to the attacks of disease. It has also been proved by Dr. Shirley Murphy, Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, in his Report for the year 1898, that the mortality from Phthisis or Consumption rises and falls with the degree of overcrowding; and this is also the case with the general death-rate. We know, besides, that the more densely populated any area, the more danger there is of infectious disease spreading, with more fatal effect. That overcrowding tends also to lower the standard of morals, public and domestic, must not be forgotten. These results surely justify the most strenuous efforts and sacrifices being made to diminish overcrowding. The reason why so much progress has not been made in the Metropolis in dealing with overcrowding lies in its inherent difficulties. It is not so easily ascertained as structural sanitary defects; its full extent is not to be measured without a house to house visitation; and the causes leading up to it are quite different and of a social character. The acquisition of "proper" housing accommodation is more or less a question of means. To the skilled artizan and better classes this accommodation is attainable without much difficulty; but as we approach the lower classes the difficulties increase, until, for the most helpless class, housing has to be provided by the Poor Law in the form of parochial relief. 60 Therefore the question which the Committee have chiefly to deal with in considering the Housing question is the extent of overcrowding in the Borough, and whether, and how best it may be abated by the adoption of Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, PAST EFFORTS TO HOUSE THE LONDON POOR. These efforts have mainly been in the direction of clearing insanitary areas, and the erection in their place of comfortable and sanitary dwellings with improved surroundings; but as an attempt to reduce overcrowding, except the overcrowding of houses on a given site, it cannot be considered a success because — (a) The accommodation has invariably been less than sufficient to house those displaced. (b) The closure and demolition of insanitary dwellings have always preceded the housing of displaced dwellers, with the immediate result of increasing the overcrowding of neighbouring houses or those in adjacent districts. (c) Owing to the conditions under which the new dwellings have been built, their rental is too high to be paid by the majority of those poor tenants displaced. (d) The schemes have been too local, and their execution has extended over too long a period to have had any appreciable effect in solving the housing problem. OVERCROWDING AND ITS EXTENT. In order to ascertain the amount of overcrowding in any district, a minimum standard of house space must first of all be decided upon, below which danger to health may be anticipated. It has been ascertained by experiment, that in order to keep the atmosphere of any inhabited room tolerably pure from the products of respiration, etc., 61 and ventilate without creating any excessive draughts, it is necessary to allow a space of at least 700 cubic feet per adult. In practice, such a standard could never be generally applied; therefore a standard of 400 cubic feet, applied to rooms used for both living and sleeping, and 300 cubic feet to rooms used for sleeping alone has been adopted by the Local Government Board for "Houses let in Lodgings," not because from a health point ef view this standard is regarded aa sufficient, but because in view of wages, rent, etc., in London it is all that can now be enforced. And, as this is the class of dwellings usually occupied by the working classes, I have taken this standard as a basis for my remarks on overcrowding in the Borough of Hackney. From numerous inspections and measurements of the cubic space of houses registered in Hackney, during the years 1898-1900, under the Bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings, I have found that even if no deduction of the air space is made for furniture or the bodies of the occupants, an average of two adults per room used for sleeping and living, is the utmost which can be allowed, without overcrowding coming in, with all its evil consequences. Of 449 houses let in lodgings and registered in the Borough, I find that 428 allowed two persons per room without overcrowding, but that three persons per room overcrowded them; and in 21 houses only could three persons per room be housed without overcrowding on the low standard taken. In the 449 houses above mentioned there were 1003 tenements, and of these 83 were overcrowded, which is equal to 8.2 per cent. of the total. After a careful consideration of the circumstances, I am of opinion that any excess of two persons per room in tenement houses means overcrowding, the evil effects of which become more pronounced as the inmates per room increase beyond this number. How far the standard I have taken is exceeded in Hackney at the present time it is impossible to say without taking a census of the Borough, but an approximation may be arrived at by an examination of the census of 1891 and 1896. It will be seen from the following table copied from the Registrar General's Census Report of 1891, that out of a total of 4,715 oneroomed tenements there were 1,210 with three and more occupants 62 to each tenement, giving an average of 3.4 persons per room: of 6,72 two-roomed tenements there were 1,451 having five occupants and over to each: of 8,078 three-roomed tenements, there were 964 each having seven occupants and over, and of 6,401 four-roomed tenement there were 473 each having eight occupants and over, the general average for the 4,098 tenements being three persons per room.

This give the number 22,398 tenements of one to four rooms at the census 1891 in Hackney alone, which I believe to be rather an under estimate. As stated above, to obtain the exact number of tenement of Hackney at the present time, a house to house enquiry would be 63 necessary; and it is doubtful if even then the exact number of occupants would be known. In the absence of this, we may assume that the rate of increase of tenements in the district during the intercensal period 1891—1896, which was 1,034 per year, has been maintained up to the present, and that the proportion of over, crowding existing in 1891 has not diminished since that date. I am of opinion, that these assumptions are fully justified, and in reality fail to represent wholly the congested state of the tenements occupied by the Working Classes. The total number of tenement houses in Hackney at the census 1896 was 46,611, which, if the above rate has been maintained would have increased at the present time to 51,521, and if the proportion of overcrowding remained the same would give at the present time in round numbers, 4,500 tenements in Hackney, or 8.7 per cent. of the total, with more than two persons occupying each room, that is to say overcrowded. It will be seen that this percentage agrees closely with the actual percentage of tenements found overcrowded during the inspection of houses let in lodgings; therefore I am inclined to believe that 8 per cent. may be regarded as a fairly reliable estimate of the overcrowding of tenement dwellings in the borough of Hackney at the present time. CAUSES LEADING TO OVERCROWDING. The causes of social phenomena are almost always complex and defy any very exact analysis; but proximate causes are generally nore or less apparent, and in considering those of overcrowding, the following, I am of opinion, have exercised the largest influence :— (a) INADEQUATE BUILDING OF WORKMEN'S DWELLINGS. Prom the following table it will be seen that the inhabitated houses it the census of 1881 averaged 6.l occupants per house; at the census of 1891 this average had been raised to 7.0 per house; at the census of 1896 to 7.3 per house, and I estimate the average to be 7.4 per house at April, 1900. 64 POPULATION AND HOUSES IN HACKNEY AT CENSUS, 1881, 1891, 1896, (1900 estimated.) Census Years. Population. Inhabited Houses. Average Inmate per house. 1881 163,681 23,934 6.8 1891 198,606 28,422 7.0 1896 213,044 29,429 7.2 Estimated 1900 224,592 30,146 7.4 Further, if we take the decennium 1881-1891 and compare the number of houses erected with the increase of population during that period, we shall find that 4,488 new houses had to provide accommodation for 34,925 persons, allowing 7.7 persons to each house and if we make the same comparison for the quinquennium 1891-1896 we shall find that 997 houses erected during this period had to provide accommodation for 14,438 persons, giving 14.4 persons to each house, and from the census of 1896, to April, 1900, 817 have been erected, which for an estimated increase of 11,548 population, gives 14 persons to each house. So that from 1881 to 1900, for a period of 19 years, at least, the growth of population in Hackney has increased at a greater rate than its housing accommodation, leading to the increase of overcrowding with its evils, and there is every reason to believe that this disproportion is continuing at the present time. It may be objected that in the census the large blocks of workmen's dwellings capable of accommodating large numbers are each counted in the census as one house, and by including such in the above calculation, my results are not accurate; but on inquiring into this matter, I am of opinion that this view of the case may be neglected, as the relations I have established would not be materially disturbed, by following the method of the Registrar General. Other evidence pointing in the same direction may be seen in the following table, which shows the number of unoccupied houses in Hackney at the Censuses 1881, 1891, 1896, and at Michaelmas, 1900 65 Year. 1881. 1891. 1891. 1900. No. of Unoccupied Houses 1,600 1,081 740 564 These figures show at least an increasing demand for housing accommodation, and strengthen the above conclusions. (b) INCREASED COST OF BUILDING MATERIALS AND LABOUR, Leading to Increased Value of Houses with Corresponding Rise in Rent. The following table shows the average prices of the chief materials used in building, together with the rate of wages of the chief workmen and labourers employed in the years 1880, 1890 and 1900.

Dabbs, of Upper Clapton. 66 It will be seen at a glance that the cost of labour and material has largely increased during the last 20 years, the average increase being shown in the table. It is obvious that this must have contributed, by its tendency to raise rents, to the increase of overcrowding. (c) INCREASE OF HOUSE RENT IN WORKING CLASS DWELLINGS. In the natural course of events it will only be expected, that as land becomes more limited and valuable in any district, the housing accommodation will increase in value pari passu, causing a corresponding rise in rentals. But in Hackney of late years there appears to have been an exceptional rise in the rentals of certain classes of dwelling occupied b; the working classes. Taking a row of 14 houses in Windsor Road, and another of 28 in Prince Edward Road, Hackney Wick, 1 find that in 1894 these wen let at 6/- per week; in 1896, the rent was 6/6 to 7/-; in 1898 it had increased to 9/- per week, and at the present time one ot two are let at 10/- per week. Also in 1894 the owner of onehouseii Windsor Road had a difficulty in letting it at 4/6 per week, but he inow receiving 8/- per week for it. A shop in Windsor Road was let at 12/- per week prior to April, 1898, but since that date the rent has been raised to 16/- per week The above instances show a rise of over 33 per cent. in the cost of mere housing amongst the working classes. If this is characteristic of all the working class dwellings in Hackney, it helps to lessen the wonder that overcrowdiug should exist in the proportions it appears to. Perhaps an explanation of the cause of these great increases in rental may be found in the fact that the above property has change hands four times in the last five years. (d) INVESTMENTS IN HOUSE PROPERTY. Of late years there has been a great demand for safe investment for money. The bank interest for deposits has been low; and it has been found that house property in certain localities is one of the 67 safest investments, and will bring in a profit of from 5 to 10 per cent. The result has been a considerable amount of speculation in house property, with a gradual rise in their value and rents. The case quoted above of the change of ownership four times in five years is an example of the process outlined. (e) SANITARY REPAIRS. This may appear to have a very small influence, but I am constantly hearing of the rent of small properties being raised after the service of notice by the Inspector for any necessary repairs. Of course this is not general, but is only practised by certain holders of property. (f) CLEARANCE SCHEMES. Within the last 10 years a large amount of house property has been demolished in neighbouring parishes under Parts I. and II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. The following table give particulars of such improvement schemes carried out in the neighbouring districts : PARTICULARS OF SCHEME UNDER PARTS I. and II. op the Housing of the Working Classes Act undertaken by the London County Council, Vestries and District Boards, in the Districts adjoining Hackney. Name of Area. Date of Representation. Part of Act under which Representation made. No. of Persons displaced. No. of Persons (a) accommodated or (b) about to be accommodated on area.

It is necessarily a matter of speculation to what extent demolition under these schemes aggravated the housing tension of Hackney, but it is not insignificant on this account. CLASS OF POPULATION OVERCROWDED. Mr. Chas. Booth, in his monumental work on the "Life and Labour of the People (East London)," has divided the population into the following classes :— (a) The lowest class of occasional labourers, loafers, and semi. criminals. (b) Casual earners—"very poor." (c) Intermittent earnings, ) „ . r together—" the poor. (d) Small regular earnings, ) (e) Regular standard earnings—above the line of poverty. (f) Higher class labour. (g) Lower Middle class. (h) Upper Middle class. Mr. Booth applies the term "poor" to those who " have a sufficiently regular though bare income, such as 18/. to 21/. per week for a moderate family, and "very poor" to "those who from any cause fall much below this standard." This was written in 1889, but I am inclined at the present time to extend the term " poor "to include those receiving, say, from 20/. to 25/. per week if a family is dependent upon this income ; and my reason for this extension lies in the fact of the rise in house rent, and in the price of other necessaries of life, since the date quoted. In Mr. Booth's enquiries the above classes were found to exist in Hackney in the proportions of the annexed table, the population having been estimated at 189,000 persons. This table gives an analysis of 142,864 persons, the difference between this and the former number being the persons unscheduled and in institutions. 69 In these proportions the different classes existed in 1889, when the population was about 186,000 persons; since that date, although the population has increased to about 227,000, no social events have occured to warrant us in assuming that the relative proportions of these classes have altered, especially in the direction of ameliorating the lot of classes A, B, C, D ; on the contrary, I am of opinion that the proportions of these classes have not only been maintained, but in all probability have been increased at the expense of the better conditioned classes. My reasons for thinking this are, 1st—since 1889 there has been an increase in the cost of housing accommodation, and in the price of other necessaries of life; 2nd—although there has been a rise in remuneration of labour, this has been chiefly confined to skilled labour, and hardly touches the classes A, B, C, D. However, assuming the proportions of the different classes are the same at the present time, their numbers would be as follows :— Classes. No. of Persons Year 1898. Percentage. No. of Persons Year 1901. A 1,664 0.9 2,060 53,542 B 15,693 8.6 19,424 C 10,758 5.8 13,316 D 15,142 8.4 18,742 E 52,216 34.3 64,630 F 32,582 17.8 40,329 G 11,034 6.0 13,657 H 1,775 18.2 2,197 140,864 100.0 174,355 Unscheduled and in Institutions 45,136 .. 52,645 Total.... 189,000 227,000 Here it may be interesting to compare Mr. Booth's classification with the Registrar General's table of persons in Hackney occupying tenements of one to four rooms. While it cannot be said definitely that rooms occupied by persons of the classes A, B, C, D must necessarily be overcrowded, one is justified in the assumption that these are the classes amongst whom the most overcrowding will be 70 found, for the simple reason that these people have a great struggle to obtain the necessaries of life ; and the claims of healthy and decent accommodation will give way to the more pressing needs of providing food, clothing, and to other exigencies. So while we do not expect any close correspondence in point of numbers between the classes A, B, C, D of Mr. Booth and the table of the Registrar General, we feel we are travelling as it were over the same ground, and dealing to a large extent with the same individuals while considering the two tables. The Registrar General's table shows 9,266 persons living in 4,715 one.roomed tenements, 21,936 persons in 6,722 two.roomed tenements, 32,700 persons in 8,072 three.roomed tenements, and 32,582 persons in 6,501 four.roomed tenements ; the total number of persons housed in the four classes of tenements being 96,484. Mr. Booth's table shows a total of 43,257 persons in his classes A, B, C, D but in considering the struggles these latter have for existence, it is more than probable that we shall find them as residents of one, two, and three.roomed tenements, and these overcrowded. On the standard earlier adopted, i.e., a maximum of two persons per room, I find amongst the Registrar General's four classes of tenements 4,098 with a population of 23,945 persons living in the proportion of more than two persons in each room ; and it is almost certain that these are almost wholly to be found in the class A, B, C, D, of Mr. Booth. This assumption is supported by a consideration of circumstances of typical cases of each class given by this writer. The above comparison has been of service, for it has enabled us to see more definitely the class of individuals amongst whom overcrowding is to be found, and to some extent its causes. "With this knowledge it will be less difficult to find a remedy. PRESENT COST OF HOUSING ACCOMMODATION. The proportion of one's income which should be devoted to rent has hitherto been estimated at about one.tenth of the income. This, of course, is only a round figure, and is frequently deviated from in 71 both directions without invalidating the principle, and this is probably the proportion expended by the better classes ; but from information acquired during the inspection of houses registered under the bye. laws for Houses let in Lodgings, it appears that those persons who are, as it were, on the verge of overcrowding, pay for their housing accommodation at the rate of about 2/6 for each room per week, that is to say, their rent fluctuates between one.fourth and one.sixth of their income. If these persons could obtain accommodation at a cheaper rate, no doubt they would get it, therefore, 2/6 may be taken as the maximum amount which can be paid by the poor without forcing them into a state of overcrowding, even on the low standard taken above. This is important as showing that housing accommodation if provided by the local authority must be at a lower rate than this, if overcrowding is to be diminished. As the crux of the whole matter appears to me to be the crowding together of immense numbers of the London population in an unhealthy manner, because they cannot afford more healthy (less crowded) accommodation, while the cost of housing bears the present relation to their incomes, it is quite clear that the housing of the poor will not be satisfactorily accomplished unless this relation is altered, and healthy housing provided within the means of the classes referred to, that is, at a cost which bears much the same proportion, if not less, to their total income as that amongst the better classes. As a provisional statement, I should say that accommodation should not be more than from 1/6 to 2/. per room per week to attract " the poor classes," and dwellings for the " very poor " should not exceed 1/. to 1/6 per week. WHAT MAY BE DONE UNDER PART III. OP THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. A Local Authority having adopted Part III. of the Act may in execution thereof: 1. Purchase land for the erection of dwelling houses for the Working Classes. 72 2. May contract for the purchase or lease of any lodging house for the Working Classes already, or hereafter, to be built or provided. 3. May erect dwellings suitable for lodging houses for the Working Classes. 4. May convert existing buildings into lodging houses, and for that purpose may alter, enlarge, repair, and improve the same respectively, and fit up, furnish, and supply the same with requisite furniture, fittings, and conveniences. 5. May, by the Amending Act of 1900, purchase land and build dwellings suitable for the Working Classes outside of the district. SUGGESTIONS. It will readily be seen from the above what are the remedies for the conditions just detailed, but to provide these remedies is not so simple a matter. It must be remembered, that unless there is some simultaneous effort of the London Boroughs to deal with this question, any local effort must, more or less, be a failure, because the overcrowded of adjoining districts would move into the district to seize the opportunity of obtaining cheap and healthy dwellings, or even residents of extra Metropolitan districts might think it profitable to move into the district for the same purpose; but if this danger is eliminated, the Borough Council might best meet the overcrowding by providing accommodation at the cheapest possible rate compatible with health. The measures which, in my opinion, would best meet the case are :— 1. To urge the Government to extend the period for the repayment of loans for the purchase of lands to 90 years, and loans for building purposes to 60 years. (The Council have already petitioned in favour of this reform). 73 2. To provide in the district for the poorest part of the munity (Class A and B) a municipal lodging house to be under local control, and the price of accommodation fixed at the lowest figure, sufficient to cover working expenses and a contribution to the sinking fund, etc. 3. For Classes C and D, the Borough may (a) Purchase and convert any suitable large houses in the borough into tenement dwellings. (b) Purchase land in the borough and erect suitable dwellings thereon at the cheapest possible rate. (c) Purchase land outside the borough (in the suburbs), and erect suitable dwellings thereon. There are limitations to the usefulness of this last, as those needing accommodation most are those who require to live in the district to be near their work, and the cost of conveyance to and from their work, if they lived in the suburbs, would probably, with the rent, be almost equal to lodging in the Borough. For these last preferential terms might be arranged with railway companies for the conveyance of the bread winners, lodged in this way, to and from their work on week days ; and this the companies ought to grant as the scarcity of accommodation has partly been brought about by the demolition of many houses during the construction of the railways which form a network over London. I do not. pretend in the foregoing remarks to have exhaustively dealt with the subject of the Housing of the Working Classes ; but I have endeavoured to treat it sufficiently in detail to enable the. Committee to grasp the essential features of the problem as it shows itself in the Borough of Hackney, and have, I hope, while neither hiding nor exaggerating the difficulties of the task before them, indicated the lines upon which their efforts should be directed to house the Working Classes of Hackney. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, J. KING.WARRY, M.D., D.P.H. Town Hall, Hackney, Medical Officer of Health. February 4th, 1901. 74 REPORT OP CANAL BOATS INSPECTOR.

To the Public Health Committee, Hackney Borough Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my annual report for the year ending December 31st, 1901. Workshops (Including Laundbies).—During the year I have paid 139 first visits and 1,833 visits of re.inspection to workshops. Of these visits 14 were prompted by complaints to the Medical Officer of Health from H.M. Factory Inspectors and others. Of the first visits 21 were to workshops subject to the regulations of the Factory and Workshop Acts, as well as to those of the Public Health (London) Act, which had not previously been visited by any Inspector, and the existence of which was subsequently notified to the Home Office Authorities by the Medical Officer. I am sure that a careful examination of the Borough would reveal the fact that there are many other occupiers of workshops who up to the present have evaded inspection of their premises. But at present, owing to the press of other work, it is almost impossible for me to undertake such an investigation. I cannot feel, however, that the workshop inspection of the district is thoroughly done until I have been able to devote some time to this purpose. Outworkers.. .The inspection of outworkers' premises has been continued this year. I have paid 262 visits of inspection. There have been registered 465 outworkers in 1901 as against 630 in 1900. This discrepancy in numbers is attributable to my ceasing to ask for lists of outworkers employed at the workshops I visited in the latter part of the year, consequent upon the passing of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1901. Section 107, sub.section 1 (c) of this Act provides that any employer of this class of worker shall send on or before the 1st day of February and the first day of August in each year copies of the lists of persons so employed by him to the District Council of the district in which the factory or workshop is situated. 76 So that I felt some saving of time might be effected by waiting until the new Act was in force, and we could legally demand the sending of lists to us, instead of copying the names and addresses of the outworkers during my visit to the workshops, often a very lengthlj process. The names of 57 outworkers living in this district, but working for employers in other parts, have been forwarded to us by various Local Authorities this year. Nuisances.—I have found nuisances existing on 483 premises; 372 of these nuisances I dealt with myself, and can report the abatement of 251, the remaining 111 were banded over to the district Sanitary Inspector by the Medical Officer of Health. In the prosecution of my duty I have found it necessary to send 253 intimations of nuisances, 19 statutory notices of same, and to apply at the North London Police Court for three summonses. Workroom cards showing the number of persons permitted in each room have been distributed to 114 workrooms. Including inspections of eight w.c.'s connected with ladies' waiting rooms at various railway stations in the district, the total number of visits paid by me in the discharge of my duties during 1901 was 2,242. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ALICE TEEBAY. 77 Table. Prosecutions under the Food and Drugs Acts and Margarine Acts during the year 1901. No. of sample. Article. Adulteration or Offence.
