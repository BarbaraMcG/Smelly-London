Gentlemen, Twenty years have elapsed since the constitution of the Lewisham District Hoard of Works in 185G, when I had the honour to be appointed your Medical Officer of Health, and we have arrived at the close of the second decenniad, during the whole of which time I have held the appointment, and I hope to the credit and satisfaction of the Members of the Board. Various changes in public opinion, and considerable advances in sanitary knowledge have taken place since that time, and I believe that the Lewisham District Board of Works has not been behind hand in the race for sanitary improvement. Many points which I have had the honour of pressing upon your attention from time to time have now become established and generally received facts, and I have thought it not uninteresting at this period of time to collate from previous reports many of the remarks and statements to which it was my duty to call your attention in previous years. Estimate of Population as compared with Census. 1871.—A correct estimate of the population from year to year is an essential foundation for the calculation of sanitary 2 statistics It is, therefore, satisfactory to know that the;i calculations adopted in my Annual Reports, based upon the number of persons per house (us shown in the previous census) and the number of inhabited houses in the district (as ascertained from the rate book), have been so nearly correct. Enumerated population census, 1871 49,663 Estimated population, middle, 1871 50,022 Removable Causes of Disease. 1856 The removable causes of disease may be classified under eight heads, viz.:— Want of light. Want of ventilation and free circulation of air. Deficient or impure supply of water. Adulterated food. Animal food rendered poisonous by disease or decay. Putrefying animal matter, drains, cesspools, slaughterhouses, &c. Marsh miasm. The state of dwelling houses. 1856.—Sundry of the causes here enumerated act more prejudicially, for various evident reasons, at a low elevation, and vary materially according to the amount of wind, temperature, peculiar state of the atmosphere, such as its electric state, barometric pressure, sudden atmospheric changes, amount of heat, moisture, rainfall, &c., &c. The healthiness of a district also depends materially upon the kind of occupation of its inhabitants; and the length of life varies materially according to the kind of employment by which its inhabitants earn their daily living. 1 or instance, in some occupations poisons enter the system through the medium of the skin, or enter the stomach, or are breathed into the lungs; in others, there is great exposure to the weather; in some, there is a great amount of loss of rest and exposure to the night air; in others, there is a great of confinement in close apartments and want of exercise; 3 in some, exposure to noxious exhalations of various kinds; in some, an excessive amount of labour; in others, there is great exposure to heat or cold; and last, though not least, in some there is great and overpowering mental anxiety. 1864.—In my first Report, published in 1856, I brought under the notice of the Hoard the general results which would take place from inattention to sanitary laws, such as want of light, want of ventilation, deficient or inferior supply of water; and this district, from its being spread over a large surface, points out, perhaps, more clearly than many others, the contrast between thoso parts which are well arranged, in a sanitary form of view, and those that are deficient in that respect; and as it is of the utmost importance fully to understand what are the surrounding circumstances which add to or detract from the causes which shorten or prolong life, and what are the conditions especially necessarv to ensure freedom from the epidemic class of disease, which annually increases the mortality of every district, it will be desirable, after some years' experience, to consider a few points which are well known to bear upon the subject. Much has been done by sanitary measures, frequent inspection of houses, &c., removal of nuisances, new drainage, and water supply, to render the district more healthy; but still, undoubtedly, as population increases, much more remains to be done; for the deaths from diseases of the epidemic class do not represent a tittle of the trouble, sorrow, and pauperism which is likely to result from sickness, and consequent privation, among the poorer class, and it is in localities which we know produce and foster disease, and are foci of contagion for other portions of the neighbourhood, that the force of the local authority is incessantly requisite to compel the provision of proper water supply, proper cleanliness, proper ventilation, and proper (well ventilated) drainage. Ventilation. 1864.—The ventilation of houses is of immense importance; no house should be so closed, either by day or 4 night, as to exclude the ingress of fresh air or the egress of foul or used-up air, and no house can be wholesome in which this is not provided for. The decomposition of air by human beings in a closed room soon deteriorates the atmosphere, and renders it unfit for oxidizing and purifying the blood. This decomposition of air is increased enormously when gas is burned—one gas jet consumes as much oxygen as live human beings. Sitting rooms should have communication with the exterior air, when occupied in the day time, by means of a properly constructed ventilator; but it might be sufficient in this changeable climate to keep a landing window open, or have an open ventilator in the ceiling of the landing at night. 1867.—As each adult person requires for the preservation of health, some 500 cubic feet of air spacc in a sleeping apartment, and without a sufficient supply of air, he is breathing over again an impure and poisoned atmosphere, which is certain to be deleterious; it is important that some limit should be placed upon the number of persons inhabiting houses, and their overcrowding prevented; but difficulties attend this subject. In this district rents are expensive, and, although it may be perfectly evident that a certain quantity of pure air is necessary for each individual, yet it is patent to every one conversant with the house accommodation of the poor that some families cook, eat, drink, wash (frequently dry clothing), and sleep in a room with a much smaller air space than above mentioned, and that if in all cases a sufficient air space were insisted on, some would find it difficult to find a residence. Hie subject ot ventilation, however, requires less delicacy in handling, as whatever the kind of accommodation rooms afford, still they may be ventilated; and a small quantity of cubic space well ventilated is better than a much larger space without such ventilation. A entilators should be fixed in every room, passage, or 5 stair-case, and the ventilators should be constant objects for examination by the inspector who visits to see that they are in good working order. 18(4.—Each room in a dwelling house should be supplied with a ventilator opening into the fresh air, which should never be closed, but which may be covered with a piece of muslin to distribute the air if draughts should be felt in winter. The ordinary outlets of the room will possibly be sufficient for the exit of foul or used-up air, but an Arnott's ventilator let into the chimnev, or a foul-air flue built from the corner of the room to a distance above the roof, renders the ventilation more perfect. Overcrowding. 1864.—The only legal means for preventing overcrowding is by section 29 of Nuisances Removal Act, section 67 Metropolis Local Management Act (referred to under head of Waters), and Lodging-house Act. Section 29 Nuisances Removal Act enacts, That whenever a house occupied by more than one family is so overcrowded as to be a nuisance or prejudicial to the health of the inhabitant", the local authority shall, upon the certificate of the Officer of Health, cause proceedings to be taken before the Justices, who are empowered to make such order as they think fit, and to inflict a penalty, not exceeding 40s., upon the person permitting such overcrowding. Magistrates have decided in some cases that overcrowding exists where the amount of cubic space is less than 400 feet for each person. But these enactments must all fall short of the purpose, unless better accommodation is provided for the poor, as the scarcity and high rental of cottages almost necessitates overcrowding, which, although not so much felt in this neighbourhood as many others, still obtrudes itselt upon our attention sometimes. No more benevolont. proceeding, to improve the status ot the mechanic and labouring man, to prevent degradation, and reduce sickness and mortality, could be undertaken, than that 6 of providing house accommodation for the poorer class; and if a joint stock company could be formed in every town (under proper management) for the purpose of purchasing sufficient land upon which to erect small cottages for the poor, it would not only be a benevolent undertaking, but would prove remunerative. 1865— In some instances in this district houses have recently been placed so closely together that there is deficient circulation of air. It seems to me to be essential that the powers of the Board should be more extended, so as to prevent houses being placed in such close proximity as to be detrimental to the health of the inhabitants. Water. 1856.—The paramount necessity for an abundant supply of pure water, both for internal use, and for purposes of cleanliness, cannot for a moment be questioned; but, as poisons contained in water are introduced into the system in the most subtle form, and in a condition which renders them most easily absorbed by the fluids of the body, and in a most unobserved and gradual manner, it behoves those who have the custody of the public health to look well into the sources of supply, and, where public companies are concerned, to its proper filtration prior to service. 1856.—As drainage is carried out it will be of great importance to look to the water supply. The supply of water should be from mains daily or constantly charged. 1857.—I should urge the importance of frequently cleansing cisterns or other receptacles for water. Many cisterns which I have examined lately, from the length of time which has elapsed since they were cleaned, contained water in a decidedly impure state for drinking. The most pure supply is liable to contamination from decomposition and dirt of this kind. 1807. I cannot, however, but constantly observe the great carelessness evinced by many occupiers of houses as to the purity of the water supplied to them, and the filthy state 7 in which the cisterns and other receptacles of water are allowed to remain, contaminating the most pure supply. 1858.—Blackheath.—Fever has been attributed, no doubt with justice, to the contamination of well water by the numerous cesspools in the locality. A suggestion is made that the new sewer should be extended so as to drain this locality. 1809.—1 am happy to inform you of the improved quality of the water from the Kent Waterworks Company, who obtain a largo supply from an artesian well upon their premises at Deptford. The river still requires improvement. 1864.—The Water Supply of the district is derived from two sources; Blackheath and Lewisham being supplied by the Kent Water W orks Company; Sydenham and Penge by the Lambeth Water Works Company. The Kent Water Works Company formerly derived their supply from the Ravensbourne river; but since the wholesale contamination of the river with sewage (which will be partly put a stop to by the new sewer), have been obliged to resort to artesian wells, which afford a considerable supply. The Lambeth Water Works Company obtain their supply from the Thames at Long Ditton. Both these companies supply water upon the intermittent principle, necessitating the use of cisterns to store the water. Section 67 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, enacts that a sufficient supply of water (not exceeding 30 gallons each person) shall be afforded to every house, and that if the water supply is not sufficient for the number of persons residing in the house (being more than one single family), proceedings may be taken as for overcrowding. Section 70 of the same Act also empowers any District Board to erect drinking fountains; and section 116 of the . original Act empowers District Boards to erect pumps for the gratuitous supply of water to the inhabitants. Examined at almost any season of the year, the cisterns attached to many of the poorer class of houses contain water 8 which is unfit for drinking. The eistern is placed over the water-closet. In many instances there is no cover, or the lid is removed, and the water is exposed to the sun's rays. The cistern is placed over the water-closet with (as I have seen sometimes the case) an untrapped waste pipe blowing sewer gas over the surface of the water. On the surface of the water may be seen green scum, the sides of the cistern covered with slime, and the bottom of the cistern loaded with mud, consisting of earthy and decomposing organic matter, and containing an abundant supply of dead and living animalcules; and in many cases no information can be obtained of their having been cleansed. Now, the connection between tainted water and cholera was fully established during the last epidemic; but although, except in epidemic times, we are not to look for such fatal results as then occurred, still, poisons of this kind contained in water are introduced into the system in such a subtle form, and in a condition which renders them so easily absorbed into the body, and in such an unobserved manner, that people are rendered ailing and miserable, and fit for the reception of any disorder; and it becomes an important duty to endeavour to get a supply as pure as possible. The only way in which to secure this effectually is by having a constant supply afforded without cisterns and with such apparatus (a spring tap would probably suffice) as would tend to prevent waste. This would not only improve the health but the morals of the people, as a supply of impure water tends to disgust the poorer class of people, and induces them to resort to less disagreeable beverages. Drinking fountains in various parts of the district, supplying pure filtered water, would also be a valuable addition to the comfort and health of the inhabitants, especially in the summer time. I860.— In my first report to the Board of Works, dated anuaiy, 1850, and in the last published report for the year 1864, as well as at other times, T directed your attention to importance of a supply of pure water. 9 This subject still demands very serious consideration. Under the present system of water supply the means of contamination are two-fold. 1st, there is danger lest the source of supply should be contaminated (for this danger the companies must be held responsible); 2nd, there is danger from the decomposition and contamination of water in the receptacles used for storage. Of this latter source of danger I have had abundant evidence, as it is quite the exception to find cisterns clean, properly covered, and unconnected with water-closet contamination; indeed, you are well aware of the very frequent complaints on this head which have come before you; and the only remedy which I think would be at all effectual would be a continuous supply. A number of details would have to be considered in affording a supply of this kind, as to iron piping instead of lead, iron water waste preventing taps, and occasional supervision. I feel convinced that this kind of supply would be productive of saving to the water companies, by preventing the waste of water from overflow; it would be a benefit to owners of house property, as it would save the necessity for cisterns for storage; and it would be an incalculable benefit to the consumers, especially those of the poorer class. It would greatly diminish sickness (especially from zymotic disease), and would greatly improve the tone of the poorer class, who pay little attention to the cleansing of cisterns, and prefer drinks, supposed to be of a cleaner kind, to swallowing a repulsive looking impure water. Indeed, if cisterns were placed more generally within view, few people would wish to partake of their contents. 1867.—The water supply of the district, although usually of good quality, is only given every other day, and not upon Sundays, and is stored in receptacles which in some instances are inadequate as to size, and in many instances are of an improper character. In many instances open butts are the only receptaclcs supplied. Again, cisterns, from neglect in cleansing, become coated and unwholesome, and frequent inspection is necessary to secure a pure supply from other 10 sources. I believe that a constant supply, with water waste preventers, would be not only beneficial to the water coin- panies, but a benefit to the inhabitants. 1868 it has been frequently asserted, but without proof, that the noxious organic matter of sewage when discharged into a river of considerable magnitude is entirely destroyed by oxydation after a flow of a few miles. This assertion is erroneous. In his evidence before the Rivera Pollution Commission, Sir Benjamin Brodie says: "I should say that it was simply impossible that the oxydising power acting upon sewage running in mixture with water over a distance of any length is sufficient to destroy its noxious quality. I believe that an infinitessimally small quantity of decaying matter is able to produce an injurious effect upon health. Five deaths have occurred at the end of the North Road. In the house in which the mortality has been caused, the pipe opening into the cistern from the cesspool is untrapped, and contaminates the water used for drinking. 1872.—Notwithstanding the Act of Parliament, passed in the Session of 1871, for the purpose of securing a constant supply of water to the Metropolis, the delivery still continues on the old intermittent system. The water drawn from the butts of consumers is much more impure than the samples drawn directly from the mains. 1873—The Government analyst states, as regards turbidity, the water supplied by the Kent Company was always bright and nearly colourless ; but that of the Lambeth Company was at times turbid from the presence of finelydivided clay of a harmless character. The nitrogen, as organic and saline ammonia, has been also remarkably small in qnantity. But the water supplied by the companies differs materially from the water which is at times contained in the cisterns and butts of consumers. Water is very liable to absorb noxious gases, as an illustrations which I may mention the great facility with 11 which the odour of paint is communicated to water. Cisterns arc often situated over water closets. The waste pipes to cisterns are in almost all instances connected with the water closets, or enter the drain direct: they are carelessly trapped, blowing off sufficient sewage gases to contaminate the water. A portion of water is also detained for a long time in cisterns, and they frequently have their covers removed, and the water is exposed to the rays of the sun. In many instances they are seldom or never cleaned, and their sides become slimy and offensive. And in most instances potable water is not filtered domestically before use. For these, amongst other reasons, great benefit would have accrued if the Water Acts of 1852 and 1873 had been successful in obtaining a constant supply of water to the residences in this district. 1874.—The purity of water does not entirely depend upon the source of supply. Major Bolton, in his reports upon water supply, calls attention to a most important point which I have frequently mentioned to the Board, viz.: the filthy state of cisterns. Milk. 1856.—Animal food rendered poisonous by disease or decay. I may also mention milk from diseased cows; and where these animals arc kept without a supply of proper food, fresh air, light, and exercise, and in the midst of offensive refuse, this may, I think, be more often a cause of disease than is anticipated. 1856.—The health of the population of any district in my opinion materially depends upon the quality of the milk supplied, especially as the main support of children is from this source; and the purity of milk much depends upon the manner in which cows are kept, as to food, water, air, exercise, and amount of space, ventilation, and cleanliness of cow-houses. 12 1858.—The milk supply of some parts of this district is very inferior in quality. I have examined samples of it which are considerably reduced with water, and probably by the extraction of cream. The cows are in many instances constantly confined to stalls, are fed upon stimulating food, and live in an impure atmosphere. This form injures the animals' health, and also deteriorates the quality of the milk. 1873. Milk is the most important of all aliments, as many infants derive their sole nutriment from it, and invalids and children are dependent upon it as an article of diet. It is liable, however, to absorb impurities both from air and water; therefore scrupulous care must be used to remove all noxious effluvia from the neighbourhood of dairies. Water is used occasionally to increase bulk in milk, and this liquid when impure has been shown to be the means of conveying disease. Cowhouses and Slaughterhouses. 1856.—I am decidedly of opinion that a closely inhabited neighbourhood is a most unfit place for animals to be kept in, and that in such a locality no animal can be "so kept" as to avoid becoming a nuisance and (in many states of the atmosphere) injurious to health. If every inhabitant householder were allowed the right of keeping pigs, cows, &c., a town would be intolerable. Further, the health of animals requires an abundance of space, and a large supply of fresh air. 1864.—The Cowhouses and Slaughterhouses of the district have been inspected, and in one or two instances the licenses have been opposed, from the fact that they were erected in the midst of inhabited houses, and that they were not kept in a sufficiently clean state. With some exceptions in this district, the animals are turned out to grass in the summer time, and brought up to the cowhouses in winter. But it is my opinion that cowhouses and slaughterhouses should not be allowed to be erected in the midst of dwelling houses, as, 1st, they must depreciate the value of property in 13 their neighbourhood; 2nd, as a matter of course nuisances must arise, with ever so great attention to cleanliness, which are likely to be prejudicial to health. 3rd. The shutting up of' cows continually, in many instances without light, and in a close locality, without sufficient supply of air, must be productive of disease in the animals, and entail consequent loss to the owner. Cowhouses should be placed in country fields alone, where the animals could have fresh air and exercise, with an abundant supply of fresh food. This would make them more healthy, and would make milk a much more desirable beverage, and food for children and invalids, than a great deal of it is at the present day ; and is most important, when it is considered how dependant infants and invalids are upon this aliment. The only way of overcoming the slaughterhouse nuisance will be that of having public abbattoirs erected out of reach of dwelling houses, where only animals can be killed and whence offal and filth can be frequently removed, under proper and constant supervision. 1873.—Several complaints have been made of the butchering cattle in confined localities and near to dwelling houses, and the offensive smell at times arising from the non removal of garbage. Some of the slaughterhouses in this district are entered from shops; some are open to the roadway in which they are situated, and are no doubt a great annoyance to the neighbouring inhabitants, and serious nuisances prejudicial to health are likely to arise. 1873.—The cow-houses in this district have been periodically inspected. Some of them are most inappropriately situated in localities surrounded by habitations, and some require an outlay for paving and draining. Great importance attaches to these necessary establishments since the occurrence of cattle plague, and if possible still greater now, since milk has been demonstrated to be a vehicle in which the poison germs of typhoid fever may be disseminated amongst human beings. 14 Not only the health of the cows, but the sanitary state of the surroundings of the dairy require minute attention. It appears to me, therefore, important that some standard rules should be adopted as to the kind of buildings appropriated for cow-houses and dairies 5 their cubic contents, ventilation, paving, drainage, water supply, situation, proximity to each other, and to dwelling-houses; rules as to washing, as to the daily removal of excrementitious matter, &c., should be laid down by the Board for the guidance of its officers and the Licencing Magistrates. Cattle Plague. 1866.—Cattle plague appeared in this country in a dairy at Lambeth on 24th June, 1865, and on the 27th in ten dairies in Islington and Hackney. The extent of the ravages of the plague is imperfectly known, from the desire of cowkeepers to conceal their losses. There is difficulty in impressing farmers with the necessity of improving the condition of the cattle. But this plague originates amongst cattle badly kept; and it is most important to prevent any liability to contagion by preventing cattle, horses, and yards from being filthily kept and affording any ingress to disease. In this district the plague fell heavily upon cattle kept in foul yards and dirty ill-ventilated cowhouses. Papers were printed and circulated by me during the plague, containing directions for the treatment, preventive and curative, of the epidemic, and, where those remedies were systematically tried, were in many cases very successful. I11 the neighbourhood of Carlisle this treatment appears to have been very beneficial. Destroy decomposition by disinfectants. Prevent overcrowding. Secure ventilation. Use strict and constant cleanliness. Give pure, nutritious food. Give pure water to drink. 15 And you put animals in such a position as may best secure for them immunity from disease. Cottage Hospital. 1863.—The establishment of a small hospital would be of great use in this district. 1807.—A cottage hospital containing a few beds would not be an expensive establishment, and would greatly tend to mitigate suffering. 1871.—Provided by the Hoard of Works, the Lewisham District Hospital for the treatment of patients (not being paupers) was opened for the reception of patients in March, 1871, its object being, for a small weekly payment, to receive patients labouring under infectious diseases, and provide proper nursing and medical attendance. It is situated in a most favourable locality, ut Hither Green Lane, entirely apart from other houses, upon an elevated and salubrious site. 1873.—The provision of a hospital in which to isolate infectious cases, is a most important advance towards diminishing disease, and its benefits, both retrospective and prospective, are duly felt by the inhabitants of the district. It speaks well for the health of the inhabitants, however, that its advantages have not been so much required in 1873. Infectious Disorders. 1803.—In seven cases of small-pox which have occurred within the last twelvemonth I have clearly traced the infection to the house of the laundress, the linen having been washed and got up in a house in which small-pox has occurred. 18G9. _On the nature of scarlet fever, and the best means of preventing it. (Page 10, published Report.) 1869.—On the nature of typhoid fever, and the best means of preventing it. (Page 12, published Report.) 1869.—Facts and reasons in favour of vaccination and the vaccination laws. (Page 14, published Report.) 16 2869—Of infectious or catching diseases, and the legal means of preventing their spreading (extracts from the Sanitary Act). (Page 16, published Report.) Mortality from Epidemic Disease. 2867. In reviewing these statistics of deaths one cannot be otherwise than struck at the low mortality during the year. But whilst we have every cause for thankfulness at the improvement of the district so far, yet it must be remembered that nearly one-fifth of the mortality has been occasioned by epidemic disease. We show only a slightly less proportional mortality from this cause than the Metropolitan rate this year. But this district is rendered by nature healthy. It is bounded by open country; its surface is of an undulating character, and affords the greatest facilities for perfect drainage; and it is in most parts considerably elevated. Therefore, as a result of all these natural advantages, we should be able to show a less proportionate mortality from this particular class of disease, which is well known and accepted to be most under the control of sanitary science. 1872.—The mortality from zymotic disease only represents a tithe of the suffering occasioned, as for every one who dies of epidemic disease many have passed through the disease, and more or less recovered. And it thus points out how necessary it is to secure to the people the blessings of pure air, both external to habitations, as well as internal to them; pure drinking water; facilities for personal and domestic cleanliness, as well as hygienic measures of every kind; by which means health and strength may be promoted, and without which suffering, pauperism, and death result. Seven Principal Zymotic Diseases. 1873-I may again venture to draw your attention to this fact, that they are said to be preventable—i. e.., if sanitary regulations were perfect, they would not occur; and supposing, 17 under other circumstances, that one case of the disease has occurred, by carrying out well-known sanitary principles, it would be nipped in the bud. 1873.—But too little is thought of spreading infection to others, and frequent communication is kept up between the sick and the healthy; wearing apparel, bed linen, &c., is sent to the laundress without preliminary disinfection, and is mixed up with the clothing of the healthy, or in some instances is washed and got up in the very room in which the sick person is lying. 1873.—These dangers would in a great measure be avoided if the Officers of the Hoard were put into possession of information as to the occurrence of every case of infectious disease, for in many instances the patient might be removed to the hospital provided for such emergencies. Forms of circulars for affording this information were supplied to the medical men of this neighbourhood, but for many reasons were not much used; and frequently the only information which reached the Officers of the Board as to the occurrence of infectious disease is tho return of the Registrar of Deaths. What can be done in the way of cleansing and disinfecting is then done; but probably the disease has gained time to be started upon its course, and cannot be rooted out suddenly. Foci of Epidemic Disease.—Epidemic disease almost invariably takes its origin in filthy localities; but its virulence is not necessarily expended there; and when once it commences there is no prejudging the amount of suffering and mortality which may take place, nor the amount of pauperism and expense that may be charged upon the parish, probably to be avoided entirely by timely and judicious attention and outlay. Ambulance. 1857.—Ambulance.—I may take the opportunity of reminding you of the extreme danger incurred by conveying patients suffering from infectious diseases in the public 18 vehicles, and the importance of the question whether such a means of spreading disease should not be prevented. 1800.—No vehicle has yet been provided for the conveyance of persons affected with infectious diseases. The street cabs are therefore still in use in this district, and must thus endanger the public health and tend to the spread of disease. 1867.—The only vehicle in this district for the conveyance of persons labouring under contagious disease is the property of the Board of Guardians of the Lewisham Union. Such a conveyance should be available at all times, in order to prevent the infection of the public cabs and railway carriages, which are at times used for such purposes. 1871.—A carriage has been purchased by the Board for the removal of patients labouring under infectious diseases. Vaccination. Vaccination.—I cannot too strongly urge the great importance of vaccination, and of re-vaccination. 1863.—In seven cases of small pox which have occurred within the last twelvemonths, I have clearly traced the infection to the house of the laundress. 1863. Four cases of small pox have occurred in one house, in West Kent Park, but the disease is not prevalent, and no deaths are registered from this cause. The presence, however, of the disease in other localities has had the effect of stimulating a large number of persons in the district to be vaccinated. A desire thus should be encouraged amongst others, as the presence of a number of unvaccinated persons in the district is certain to favour the spread of small pox. In case of small pox occurring, what remains to be done is to afford means for the conveyance, reception, and treatment of persons suffering from this disease. This number of persons who have taken this disease in this district has been minute, but it is to be remembered that the danger in each case of allowing the patient to remain 19 in his own residence, and the consequent necessity for removal remain as great. 1863.—Whilst mentioning this class of disease, small pox, I feel it my duty to state that the establishment of a small hospital, constructed upon an elevated and open space of ground, would be of great use in this district. 1864.—I have in each monthly report particularly specified the locality in which deaths from epidemic disease have occurred, and from this information it may bo readily ascertained where the exact spots exist in which epidemic disease is likely to originate. 1871.—With regard to small pox it has long been well known, and has lately been additionally proved, that the efficiently performed operations of vaccination and re-vaccination puts a stop to the disease by destroying the liability of any vaccinated person to receive it. Disinfection. 1867.—Epidemic disease is continually propagated by infected clothing. Even amongst some of the richer classes little is thought during illness of communicating disease to the healthy, and infected articles of wearing apparel are no doubt often sent to the laundress and mixed with those belonging to the healthy, without thought as to previous disinfection. But amongst the poor the danger exists to a greater degree, as they have not the means at their command of overcoming this danger. Of all disinfectants heat is the best; and if a steam oven were erected in some central part of this district, and a conveyance procured for the removal of infected articles, and their re-delivery in a pure state, medical men in attendance upon infected cases would be always ready to assist the local authority by urging this necessity upon the inhabitants, and epidemic disease would doubtless be much lessened in its severity. 1870.—No public disinfecting apparatus exists in this 20 district. This is much needed, as disease is fostered and spread from infected bedding and clothing. I 1873 The subject of domestic disinfection in a sick room has been treated of in former reports, but 1 may recapitulate former directions. A washing tub or vessel containing a mixture of one table spoonful of Sir W. Burnett's chloride of zinc, or of good carbolic acid, to one gallon of water should be ready to receive linen, &c.,of all kinds. All vessels intended for the reception of the excretions of patients should have a similar solution placed in them. The drains should be flushed daily with a solution of similar strength; the rooms also sprinkled with a similar solution. Baths and Wash-houses. 1867.—In this large district no facilities for bathing exist, and in some instances all the washing (and in wet weather all the drying) of linen by the poor has to be done in their own houses and rooms, and renders them uncomfortable and unwholesome. Establishments of this kind might be made self-supporting, or, if not, would be assisted by the subscription of the inhabitants. And a disinfecting chamber might be connected with the building. 1869.—There is much need in the district, as I have explained in former Reports, of a steam oven or other apparatus for disinfecting the clothes, linen, bedding, &c., of those who are or have been suffering from epidemic disease, &c. Disinfecting Apparatus. 1873. In some of the London districts public disinfecting chambers are constructed for purifying infected clothes and bedding by means of heat; and I find that many miscellaneous articles of wearing apparel are constantly sent for prification. It has not been deemed of sufficient importance to erect a building for that purpose in this district, but 21 cesses of disinfection arc adopted in accordance with the provisions of the Sanitary Act. 1874.—A disinfecting apparatus has been purchased by the Board, and will shortly be erected in some convenient part of the district, where it will be available for public use as a disinfectant of wearing apparel, bedding, &c. Drainage. 1856.—Separation of surface water from sewage. It would be advisable attentively to remove direct (house) drainage and convey it into the sewer. Arch the watercourse over, and allow it to remain as a drain for the surface water. 1808.—I am not aware that there is any map or sufficient register of house drainage in the district. May I be allowed to suggest that as drainage is carried on it will be most important to have some easy and accurate means of reference as to what houses have been drained, and when and in what manner this has been done? 1864.—The drainage of houses appears to me to be faulty in principle. Inconveniences from the entry of sewer gas might with small amount of cost be remedied by cutting off all direct communication with the sewer. Thus- Let the water-closet be well trapped and in a well ventilated building, which may be connected with the house, but not within it. Do not allow the soil pipe to be within the house; do not let the waste pipes from cisterns, or the pipes from sinks communicate directly with sewers or cesspools; these pipes should merely pass through the wall of the house, and have a free end hanging a few inches above a trapped gully outside the house. By this arrangement many of the inconveniences of stopped drains would be avoided, and no sewer gas from this constant cause could enter the house. It appears to me always injudicious to place a drain within a dwelling-house, and I have from this cause seen pernicious effects to arise from the entry of sewer gas. If it 22 is positively necessary to resort to this method of drainage, the pipes should be well cemented together, and carried at a, sufficient depth in the earth ; and to make this additionally secure, they should be ventilated by shafts outside the house. 1365.–I would again mention to you the condition of drains as a subject which demands constant care. Under the present system of drainage, houses are supplied with sinks, water-closets, baths, &c., within the house, all of which communicate directly with the sewer. These communications are essentially chimneys to the drain, and, unless the sewer be most carefully ventilated, are constantly apt (especially when the internal air of the dwelling is rarified by warmth) to pour poisonous gases into the house. In many cases this happens from carelessness in trapping, or by leaving traps to drains open, and, aided by the neglect to ventilate houses at night, is doubtless a frequent source of illness and loss of life. 1867.—I am not aware that any register exists which would accurately detail the plan and method of drainage of every house in the district. 1867 —-A ledgered list of all houses should be formed, with reference to a numbered plan. 1867.—Although a large amount of beneficial work has been done as regards the sewage of the district, still some parts are without drainage, by which I mean that houses are only drained into cesspools, which would require periodical pumping in the clay portion of the district, or they would overflow and deposit their decomposing contents upon the adjacent land or into ditches ; or in the gravel portions of the district their contents would percolate through the soil, and contaminate adjacent wells. These cesspools are seldom ventilated, and the gaseous products of decomposition are liable to find their way into dwelling houses. 23 Ventilation of Sewers, Cesspools and Drains. 1864.—The offensive smell from ventilating shafts in the roads, and from gullies when the water has escaped from the traps in dry weather, has been frequently a subject of complaint. This offensive smell would not be so much occasioned by fresh sewage, but in this district, like many other progressive districts, new sewers frequently receive the contents of old drains connected with cesspools or masses of putrefactive decomposition, and thence the effluvium is worse than it otherwise would be. But the ventilation of sewers is of the utmost importance to health. It has been proved that in the interior of houses where fires are kept, a continued diminution of the pressure of the atmosphere takes place, and there is a continual pouring into the house of sewer gas; the means of entry being through water-closets, waste pipes to cisterns, sinks, and drains in the house. The closing of ventilating shafts in sewers would, therefore, assist in forcing into houses a deadly supply of sewer gas, and would render the sewer unsafe for any workman to enter it for the purposes of cleansing or repair. The means of remedying the offensive smell from these sewer openings or ventilating shafts, would be either by dry charcoal gratings, or by chimneys erected against some building and communicating with the sewer, and so high that the gases would be thrown out of reach, and oxidized by the atmosphere. But as impure air, like impure water, though sometimes slow, (unless concentrated) is always certain in producing its pernicious effects, in my opinion no system on drainage can be perfect which admits the possibility of the entry of sewer gas into the house, and no house can be wholesome in which the entry of fresh air and the exit ot foul air is not provided for. Sewer gas may enter dwelling houses in several ways, 24 as before mentioned, viz., by water-closets and soil pipes, waste pipes to water cisterns which communicate with the closet pipe or with the sewer, by sinks, which are always insufficiently trapped, in which the trap is frequently removed, or by drain pipes under houses insufficiently cemented. The ventilation of sewers requires particular attention. It is necessary that sewers should bo Ventilated, other wise, whilst the present system of drainage exists, the gases formed from their decomposing contents would be liable to find their way into dwelling houses, especially when the atmosphere within them is rarified by heat. But the offensive smell from these ventilating apertures is often complained of, more especially in the higher portions of the district. In such cases charcoal boxes might be and have in some cases been affixed. Ventilating pipes or shafts might be placed by the sides of buildings; but in no case should the number of ventilating apertures be diminished. 1869.—I am of opinion that a more rigid inspection of houses in the district is advisable, to show whether they are all properly drained into the main sewers constructed in various parts of the district, and to see that old drains, cesspools, and receivers, are done away with where practicable. Constant observation proves, as I have before mentioned, that the drainage of houses should be as much as possible external to them, that the soil pipes from closets should be outside buildings, that the pipes from sinks should never be allowed to enter the drain, and that the overflow pipes from cisterns should never be connected with a closet or sewer. 1870.—Same as abover, Added to which that every drain should be provided with a ventilating pipe of sufficient height to carry off foul out of reach, and to prevent the possibility of sewer air forcing itself into houses, especially at night, when houses are closed. That it would be as well if the public generally would earbolic acid more extensively in private houses for drains 25 and closets, as its general use would prevent putrefactive decomposition, and render the atmosphere of drains and sewers much more wholesome. 1874.— I he ventilation of sewers is of great importance, as, from the general construction of house drains, sinks, and waste pipes, if these ventilators did not exist, sewer air would necessarily be forced into dwelling houses. If, however, this is important as regards sewers, it is of equal importance as regards cesspools, and no householder should allow an unventilated cesspool to remain upon his premises. The best method of ventilating house drains, and the one which this Board has adopted and ordered to be applied to new houses in the district, is to have the drains ventilated by a pipe carried up a sufficient distance above the roof, and out of the reach of windows, into which all water closets should open. This pipe should be bent at the top, or provided with a Banner cowl, to prevent accidental stoppage by birds, &c. The pipes from sinks, overflow pipes from cisterns, the pipes from baths and lavatories should never enter the drain. They should terminate in the open air, and discharge their contents into a trapped gully hole outside the house. The discharge of a small quantity of carbolic acid from every house would prevent putrefactivo fermentation in sewers, and further prevent nuisances dangerous to health. Cooking Tuition. 1874.—A large quantity of nutritious provision is annually wasted amongst all classes in this country by careless and wasteful manipulation in the process of cooking, and by the rejection of articles of food which, if properly used, might afford nourishment in the form of soups or otherwise. The cost of meat supply is rendered greater to all classes by the purchase of what are called prime joints, whilst other parts of the same animal, which are not known to most householders by name, are termed inferior, but would afford 26 an equal amount of nutriment if carefully and tastefully prepared. Trades and arts are usually acquired by careful training under the instruction of skilled masters, but no instruction is usually given in the art of preparing food in the most economical and healthful manner, other than by mistresses, who, from having paid little or no attention to such matters themselves, ore incompetent to teach, and cooking is commonly learned hap-hazard, at a large and constant cost for waste. Teachers should commence by teaching what to buy, and how to cook for those with the humblest means. School Board. 1874.—It is most important that schools should not be allowed to be a means of spreading disease by receiving children affected with contagious disease. And it is satisfactory to know that children are not re-admitted to school after having had contagious diseases without a certificate from the medical man who has had such cases in charge that recovery has taken place. What a vast additional instrument for good the School Board might become if children were instructed in that most desirable information, the means of preventing the causes and spread of disease ! If they were taught to fear the disadvantages and poison of intemperance, the danger of overcrowding, the necessity for pure water and pure air ; in fact if that sanitary knowledge which the poorer classes especially require were instilled into the plastic minds of young children ! 1856. The elm trees of this parish are being destroyed by a small beetle (the Scalytus Destructor.) Unless attended to all fine elm trees in the parish must ere long yield to insect lavages. The plan which I should suggest (and 27 appropriate at this season of the year) would be to cut down and burn all the trees attacked. Trees of a different kind might also be at this season of the year planted to supply the place of those destroyed. Trees in Cemeteries. The great importance of planting cemeteries with trees, shrubs, grass, &c., ought to be considered, as vegetation not only separates the noxious products of decomposition, but converts them to a useful purpose, and is a source of ornament and health.

Eighty-three marriages were solemnized at the several Church of England churches in the hamlet of Penge, seven in Nonconformist chapels, and one at the Register Office, making a total of 376 in the Lewisham district, or an increase of 33 over those registered in 1874. Births. The registered births during the 52 weeks of the year, 1870, amounted to 1,878; males 989, females 889, showing an increase of 126 on the number registered in the year 1874. The birth rate to population was 3232 per 1,000, or one birth to every 31 persons. The annual rate of births in London was 35.7. In England the birth rate was 35.5 per 1,000. In the United Kingdom 34.0 per 1,000. The birth rate in 21 large towns was 37.1. 29 Deaths. 1875.—The number of deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1875 was 953 ; of this number the deaths amongst males were 468, amongst females 485. The annual rate of mortality was 16.40 per 1000. The annual rate of mortality in England and Wales was at the rate of 22.8 per 1000.; of London, 23.7, and of districts outside Registration London, 17.9 per 1000; of Birmingham, 26.5; of Liverpool, 27.5; of Sheffield, 24.8; of Portsmouth, 19.5. In Philadelphia the death rate is 22.27; in Vienna, 31.42 : and in New York and Berlin, over 29.0 per 1000. By reference to Table III., which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be seen that of the 953 deaths from all causes registered during the year 1875, 266, or nearly 28 per cent. (27.91), died under one year of age, and 92 between the ages of 1 and 5; so that 358, or nearly 38 per cent. (37.56) of the whole number of deaths, were those of children under the age of 5 years. 266 deaths occurred under 1 year. 49 between the ages of 1 and 2 43 „ „ „ 2 „ 5 36 „ „ „ 5 „ 15 49 „ „ „ 15 „ 25 04 „ „ „ 25 „ 35 79 „ „ „ 35 „ 45 79 „ „ „ 45 „ 55 93 „ „ „ 55 „ 65 99 „ „ „ 65 „ 75 82 „ „ „ 75 „ 85 14 „ „ „ 85 „ 95 Of the diseases which produced the mortality at the ages mentioned— 144 took place from zymotic diseases. 198 „ „ constitutional diseases. 432 „ „ local diseases. 30 158 took place from developmental diseases. 29 „ violent deaths. 2 „ causes not specified, or ill-defined. Preventable Diseases. Six. of the seven principal zymotic diseases, viz., measles, scarlet fever, diptheria, whooping cough, different forms of fever, and diarrhoea, caused 104 deaths, at the rate of 109.13 per 1000—a number below the average of 10 years (129 6), and 14 less than the number registered last year. The annual average number of deaths during the same 10 years having been in London 190.02 per 1000, and in England and Wales 18115. Small-pox.—As during the years 1873 and 1874, so during the past year (1875), no deaths from Small-pox were registered. The Vaccination Officer of the Lewisham Parish informs me that during the year 1875 1241 children were successfully vaccinated, and that, after deducting for deaths of infants and certificates of insusceptibility to the disease, &c., the whole of the children born, with the exception of two, were vaccinated. 348 children were vaccinated in Penge during the same period. 1875.—Measles.—5 deaths were reported from measles ; the annual average of 10 years having been 15. The largest mortality from this disease occurred in 1868, when 34 deaths took place from this cuuse. Scarlet fever continued to be more or less prevalent throughout the year, but only 11 deaths took place from this cause; the annual average from this cause having been 30. The largest mortality in any one year having amounted to Diptheria. 8 deaths were attributed to diptheria, 11 having been the annual average. A\ hooping Cough.—17 deaths took place from whoopp cough, the annual average of 10 years having been 20. 31 Fever.—23 deaths took place from fever, 18 having been the average of the previous 10 years; the largest mortality registered from this cause in one year having been in 1869, when 28 deaths were registered from this cause. Diarrhœa.—40 persons died from diarrhoea in 1875, the previous average of 10 years having been 31, and the largest number registered in any one year of that term of years having been in 1870, when the mortality from this cause amounted to 48.

Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to submit my Seventh Annual Report upon work carried out in my department during the financial year. HIGHWAYS. The following Table will give the quantities of Material used in the repair of the Highways:— Division. Granite. Port Philip. Land Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Gravel. Hard Core. Total. Lewisham, cubic yards 2793 562 400 1672 1967 96 Penge „ „ 116 517 2317 Total 2909 562 917 1672 4284 96 10440 Note.—This includes the material used in making up roads where the new kerbing and channelling was laid; also the material used for repairing tar pavoment. Last year 1856 cubic yards of granite and Port Philip, and 8013 cubic yards of flints, gravel, &c., were used throughout the district. This year 3471 cubic yards of granite and Port Philip have been used, and 6969 cubic yards of flints, gravel, &c. A gradual substitution of a better material than flints for maintaining the roads cannot fail to be beneficial, and in fact a good effect already has been produced. By the use of granite, or a tougher material than flints or gravel, a saving is effected not only in the wear and tear of the roads, but also in the slopping and watering. 2 Three Slop-carts have been purchased during the year, and the work of cleansing the streets has been extended and improved; but I am bound to say in very wet weather I have not a sufficient number of slop-carts to clear the streets of slop as rapidly as I should wish. As the ground is built upon in the district the difficulty of finding shoots for the slop will increase, and it is already felt, for I have now to carry slop a very much longer distance to obtain a shoot than formerly. The table includes the material used for raising the roads where the new kerbing and channelling has been laid; also in re-coating and repairing the older paths laid with tar pavement. The roads are in good condition. The total cost of the Highways in Lewisham for maintenance, slopping, and new gullies during the year was £8,255, and in the Hamlet of Penge £1,783. There were many new gullies constructed in Lewisham and in the Hamlet of Penge. This cost includes work in raising roads necessitated by kerbing and channelling, and making up road under the 106th Section. The rainfall from the 26th March, 1875, to the 25th of March, 1876 (inclusive), was as follows:— in. dec. 1875. March 0.500 April 1.550 May 1.460 June 2.280 July 5.280 August 2.280 September 2.660 October 4.130 November 2.900 December 1.060 1876. January 1.120 February 1.490 March 1.930 28.640 Rain fell on l65 days, and the rainfall was 0.25 more than the corresponding period of last year. There was a very heavy thunder-storm upon the 7th of August. Great damage was done to the roads, particularly the Belvedere Road, in Penge. The storm lasted about an hour. The rainfall registered during the 3 storm at the Penge Stone-yard was 1.20 in., and at the Deptford Pumping Station 1.63 in. ROAD WATERING. The watering of the roads on Blackheath and the greater portion of Lewisham was done by the Board's horses and men. In Sydenham and Forest Hill Messrs. Puplett & Stimpson contracted for horses and men at a price of 8s. 9d. and 8s. fid. per day respectively. In the Hamlet of Penge Mr. Winnifrith supplied horses and men at a contract price of 8s. per day. The cost of the watering in Lewisham during the past year was £2,327, and in the Hamlet of Penge £700. Three of Bailey's Hydrostatic Vans were purchased for Lewisham, and the Board have now 5 vans and 21 water carts belonging to Lewisham Parish, and 1 van and 7 carts belonging to the Hamlet of Penge. During the hot weather the usual deficiency of the supply of water occurred in the Lambeth Water Company's district. At Perry Hill the supply was so bad that it took from fifteen to twenty minutes to fill an ordinary water cart. Under such circumstances watering the roads becomes almost useless. LIGHTING. There arc at present 560 lamps in the Parish of Lewisham lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, at a contract price of £4 3s. 4d. per lamp per annum, and 439 lighted by the Phoenix Gas Company at a contract price of £4 12s. per annum. In the Hamlet of Penge there are 295 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company at a contract price of £4 3s. 4d. per lamp per annum. The following gives the additional lamps erected during the year in the district. Lewisham. Holly Tree Terrace 1 Algernon Road 2 Granville Park 2 Bradford Road 1 Derby Villas 1 Fransfield Grove 1 Codrington Road 1 Half-a-dozen of Skelton's Catoptric Reflectors were fixed to the lamps in Lewisham by way of experiment; but I cannot report very favourably upon them. No doubt they arc an improvement, but I do not consider of sufficient extent to warrant their being introduced throughout the district. I received instruction to fix 10 meters to lamps in the district of the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, 10 being already fixed in the Phoenix Gas Company's District. The subject of consumption of gas is still under the consideration of the Works and General Purposes Committee ; therefore it is not necessary for me to make any mention of such in this Report. The following Table will give the cost of the Lighting throughout the District during the year. 4 Lewisham—Continued.

The cost of collecting dust, ashes, &c., in the Parish of Lewisham was £1,146; and the sale of the dust amounted to £140. In Lewisham the Board employed their own men and boys, and contracted for the supply of horses and carts. There were 7,370 loads of dust, &c., collected during the year. The contractors for the supply of horses and carts were Mrs. Grant, Lewisham; Messrs. Jewkes and Stimpson, Sydenham ; Mr. Jewkes's price being 5s. 6d. per day, Mrs. Grant and Mr. Stimpson 6s. per day. Cost of Lighting the District of Lewisham. March, 1875, to March, 1876.

No doubt the work has been more efficiently done. The total cost of the collection in Penge was £707, and the sale of dust realized £100 during the year. The removal of dust from the houses is under the immediate superintendence of the Inspectors of Nuisances of each District. NEW WORKS. Kerbing and Channelling.

This is by far the largest amount of Kerbing and Channelling work which has ever been carried out in one year by the Board, and represents in round numbers 28,700 feet run of footpath kerbed and channelled, and 1,163 square yards of roadway crossings. This does not include any work in new streets. Some delay took place on account of the difficulty of obtaining material by the contractors. The work in Lewisham was done by Messrs. Mowlem and Co., and in Penge by Messrs. Beevers. TAR PAVING. The Tar Paving laid on the public footpaths in Lewisham during the year amounted only to repairing. In Penge the following paths were laid. Sq. Yards. Croydon Road— Beckenham Road to "Robin Hood" 2346 From the "Mitre" to the end of Boundary, Croydon Road 950 Anerley Road— Near Railway Bridge 116 Station Road 125 Palace Road— Palace Square 800 Beckenham Road 1420 St. John's Road 510 Penge Lane (both sides) 1054 Total 7321 The work was done by the Board's own workmen, and looks very well. 8 ROCK ASPHALTE.

The price paid to the Limmer Asphalte Company was 5s. 2d. per superficial yard. The work was substantially done, and at present has every appearance of lasting. 9 IMPROVEMENTS.

Attention has been paid to improving the ventilation of both public and private sewers. The Sanitary Committee have had the matter of the ventilation of house drains under consideration, suggestions and regulations have been drawn up, with a lithographed plan explanatory of the same. (See Min., p. 283, par. 15.) An experiment as to ventilation was tried in the Wells Road sewer and its ramifications; open ventilators were constructed and pipe ventilators were erected, surmounted with Banner's Patent Cowl. These ventilators were additional to those already in the sewers and collateral branches. The object of the experiment was to ascertain to what extent Banner's Patent Cowl extracted the foul air or gas from the sewer. I made some very careful experiments with an amemometer made on purpose. To give a table showing the result of each experiment I have made would take up too much space, and as I experimented in the larger sewers at Greenwich, in conjunction with officers of the Engineer's Department of the Metropolitan Board of Works, I have had a very good chance of going thoroughly into the matter. The result of my experiments is that the Patent Cowl, as made at present, is more applicable to the ventilation of house drains and pipe sewers than large brick sewers, and that it requires a force of wind moving at the rate of about four miles an hour to make the Cowl work properly. I consider the experiments I made prove I was right in having the open ventilators in the Wells Road as well as pipe \ entilators. (See Min., p. 252, par. 11). I have no hesitation in saying the atmosphere of the Wells Road Sewer is greatly improved since the additional ventilators were put in, and I expect I shall have instructions to ventilate the whole of the deficiently ventilated sewers upon the same principle adopted in the Wells Road Sewer. I am glad to say the 51 ventilators put in the sewer in Penge last year appear to have 13 answered very well, and few complaints have been made of them smelling: My idea always has been to ventilate a sewer in sections, and to have a large number of ventilators. The work of repairing the sewer along Stanstead Lane from the "Raven," Catford, to the "Telegraph" public house, was successfully carried out. The work was done by the flushing men employed by the Board, with the assistance of a bricklayer. I mention this to show I exercised the greatest economy in repairing the sewer, and I am sure had the work been done by Contract it would have cost much more. The private sewers constructed during the year have been regularly inspected during the progress of the work, and 1 believe one half of the time of the Inspectors of Works is taken up with private works. The large sewers have been regularly cleaned out during the year. The Crystal Palace Gas Company gave a great deal of trouble by allowing gas refuse to find its way into the main sewer. I took several samples of liquid when flowing from the connection of the Crystal Palace District Gas Company into the Sydenham and Ravensbourne Sewer, and the Metropolitan Board of Works took proceedings upon the strength of the evidence I produced. The Gas Company submitted to a conviction. The corrections of the 25 inch Ordnance Map of the Parish of Lewisham were completed during the year, and I have received instructions to correct the Map of Penge. The Board have determined to have the whole lithographed. Referring to my last year's Report as to the portions of the District without an outfall Sewer, negociations are in progress which will, I hope, result in the construction of a Sewer from the Cemetery gates, Lewisham, to the boundary with Deptford, and I have received instructions to prepare a plan for the drainage of the district around Nightingale Grove.
