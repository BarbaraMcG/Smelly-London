FORTY-NINTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the Year 1904. To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors,— I.—INTRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Forty-ninth Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District of St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since l856, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1900, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last mentioned date have been so great that it has been found necessary to insert as a frontispiece to this Report the small maps of them in previous and present use. These three small maps show the areas (1) previous to 1900, (2) at the Census in 1901, and (3) at the present time. (The two south Southern Sub-Districts, although still separate, are amalgamated in the statistics for the present year, as it is intended to amalgamate them at some future date, and for the sake of continuity it is desirable not to have to make any further changes in the statistical records.) ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF THE CENSUS OF 1931. In the Report for 1903, were inserted tables showing the numbers and the percentage of statistical or Census over-crowding, that is, more than two persons per room, in each of the 115 Enumeration areas of the Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras. In this Report is inserted a coloured map of the Borough shewing graphically by depths of shading the degrees of Census over-crowding in each of the Enumeration areas. The letters S.S. on certain areas signify Special Schedules and refer to certain Public Institutions that cannot be treated in this statistical manner.

In 1863, when the Midland Railway Company demolished Agar Town and took a portion of the old St. Pancras burying ground, the site of the present Mortuaries, Coroner's Court, etc., upon which some houses stood, was cleared, and was used for the re.interment of the disinterred bodies. In 1871, the Vestry erected on the site a temporary smallpox hospital and a permanent disinfecting station. At this period the Vestry Clerk was also Clerk to the Guardians, and after the removal of the hospital a wooden structure was erected on the site which was used by the Vestry, by the Guardians, and by the Coroner, as a Mortuary and for post.mortem purposes; the disinfecting station remaining until reconstructed in 1885. In 1885 the Vestry erected on the site a set of buildings including a Coroner's Court and three mortuaries, one for infectious cases, one for the use of the Vestry, and one for the use of the Guardians, the Clerk to the Guardians and the Vestry Clerk being the same officer. The funds for the construction of these buildings were provided by the Vestry. 24 THE REGISTRATION OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS. The form for the weekly returns of births registered, approved by the Registrar General, was also approved by the Borough Council as set out below. The form for the weekly returns of deaths registered was approved by the Borough Council in accordance with Section 28 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1874, as are here set out— Births Registered.

By the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1874, deaths are required to be registered within five days of their occurrence, but births are required to be registered within six weeks, and may remain unregistered for three months without expense to the persons whose duty it is to give the information, unless required by notice from the Registrar to attend and give the information. This delay may be extended to twelve months by registering before the Superintendent Registrar, and by paying fees to the Superintendent and District Registrars. Beyond twelve months the express permission of the Registrar General is required.

It is well to know that unrecognised cases largely spread infectious diseases. Discovery. —Mild cases of indisposition or disease excite no particular attention or are attributed to other than the real cause by parents, guardians, or friends, and are not submitted to medical examination. This is particularly the case with chicken-pox, and when small-pox has been prevalent this has occurred on many occasions with disastrous results. In order to discover promptly the localities of cases of chicken-pox, and the ages, etc., of the patients, notification of the disease is required, and the practical effect of this is also to cause medical opinion to be sought. The London County Council during the prevalence of small-pox made the notification of chicken-pox compulsory for a period of four months dating from the 30th of March. When cases of suspected infectious diseases are discovered there is sometimes considerable difficulty and delay in making an exact medical diagnosis in certain types of the diseases. Here bacteriological and additional clinical examination are brought to bear upon doubtful types, and to check or confirm the diagnosis. Bacteriological Tests.—The number of specimens of secretion, blood and sputum submitted to bacteriological tests during the year in suspected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, and the results of examination were as follows:— Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Diphtheria (Secretion) 25 2 65 92 Reaction obtained. Doubtful. Reaction not obtained. Total. Typhoid (Blood) 26 .. 46 72 Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Tuberculosis (Sputum) 3 .. 6 9 Clinical Examination.—In the case of Small-pox, to which disease no bacteriological test is at present applicable, the London County Council provided for additional Clinical Examination by arrangement with two experts, formerly officers at the Small-Pox Hospitals, so that their services were made available by telephone, telegram, or letter, from the 30th March to the 7th August. 31 § 2.—NOTIFICATIONS.

This comparatively benign but very infectious disease is prevalent at the same season of the year when Small-pox is prevalent, and gives rise to alarm. Amongst foreigners engaged in the making of clothing, Chickenpox invading the children of their families does not disconcert them, and, when not a notifiable disease, is especially liable to be spread without any knowledge of its source. The disease was made notifiable for four months during the year dating from the 8th April, and ceased to be notifiable on the 8th August. TYPHOID FEVER. During the months of August and September a number of cases of Enteric Fever occurred in the neighbourhood of Ferdinand Place. In spite of very detailed inquiry, it was found impossible to limit the prevalence to any one cause. Personal infection was a considerable factor in the spread of the disease, as in five families in the same number of houses the first cases, spread over some weeks, did not attract particular attention, and were nursed at home without 35 any precautions for varying periods until diagnosed and removed to hospital. These appear to have given rise later on to at least fourteen secondary eases. The milk supplies afforded no clue to the prevalence. Condensed milk of various brands was used in some eight families, nine different retailers supplied fresh milk in other cases, and when the inquiry was followed up to the wholesale dealers it was found that the milks were delivered as they came to hand, and that the interchange could not be followed up to the numerous farmers who supplied the various dealers, and furthermore that several other farmers supplied several milk retailers directly. There was evidence that in a few cases fried fish had been eaten, and in one instance the patient expressed his suspicion of the shell-fish he partook of. But neither shell-fish nor fried fish afforded an}' special clue. On the whole there was no one origin that could be regarded as the cause of the prevalence of the disease; it is possible that several causes may have been acting coincidently, if so, they were so inextricably interwoven as to defy analysis. MEASLES. The following letter and order in reference to Measles was received from the London County Council, having been addressed to medical practitioners throughout London :— County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 16th March, 19C3. Sir, MEASLES.

Section 64 provides that any person letting, or showing for the purpose of letting, a house or part of a house, who knowingly makes a false statement as to a case of infectious disease being or having within six weeks previously been, therein, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Twenty Pounds, or to a month's imprisonment with or without hard labour. Section 65 provides for a penalty not exceeding Ten Pounds, on persons ceasing to occupy infected houses or parts of houses without disinfection or notice of the previous existence of the disease to the owner •or master of the house or part of the house, or knowingly making a false answer to questions on the subject.

The room adjoining the wash house under the Contact Shelter was fitted with a couple of bath-rooms, and a small waiting place, at a cost not exceeding £45. Accommodation was thus provided for the cleansing of the person and clothing of men infested with vermin. It was then found that women and children required similar accommodation, and the end room with bath room and w.c. of the Contact Shelter over was fitted with two more bath-rooms and small waiting room, cut off from the Contact Shelter by a wall, and approached by an external iron staircase.

At the end of the year, in accordance with the recommendation of the Reorganisation Committee, the Inspector of Workshops (Men) and the three Inspectors of Tenement Houses were made District Inspectors, and each allotted one-half of Wards 1, 5, 7, and 8, and all the District Inspectors were instructed to include amongst their duties the inspection of registered tenement houses, and workshops and factories where men are employed. Notice was given to builders and others that the Sanitary Inspectors can be interviewed at the Town Hall only between 9 and 9.30 a.m., and instruction was given to the Inspectors to complete their office work and leave the Town Hall not later than 10 a.m. Inspector's Report.— The following is the Report of the Special Inspector:— To the Medical Officer of Health. March, 1905. Sir, I beg to submit my report for the year 1904. Small-pox.— I investigated two cases of small-pox during the year, one on June 9th, at H— S—. I was unable to trace the source of infection in this case; the other occurred at P— S— on June 28th, the patient, a Russian Jew, arrived in London from Libau two days before removal to Hospital. 27 Small-pox contacts came to the Contact Shelter where they received a warm bath, and had their clothing steamed. Contact Shelter.— In addition to the 27 contacts mentioned above, five other contacts of infectious disease came to the shelter and were dealt with in the same manner, including a midwife who had been attending a case of puerperal fever in a neighbouring Borough, but resided in this. Cleansing of Persons Act.— In the early part of the year the Borough Council resolved that a certain sum of money be expended upon providing baths for men. The work was completed on May 2nd. Circulars notifying the provision of baths, &c., for verminous persons, were sent to the Hospitals, Schools, Police Stations, and other Public Institutions in the Borough. Owing to the demand it was found necessary to provide accommodation for women and children; the alterations were completed on August i 9th, with the result that we now have good accommodation for both males and females. 1796 persons came to the personal cleansing station, and received a warm bath; carbolic and soft soap being provided. Whilst the person is in the water his or her clothing is steamed. Every month the station becomes more known, and if the numbers continue to increase I expect more than 3000 persons will be dealt with next year. Disinfection.— During the year 242 rooms were fumigated, and 244 stripped and cleansed alter infectious disease. 57 On April 1st the contract for stripping and cleansing of rooms expired, and was not renewed by the Council, as the system of spraying and fumigating rooms had been adopted by them; the difficulty previously experienced of finding a suitable spraying apparatus was overcome by the discovery of a light portable apparatus with a maximum atmospheric pressure of 451bs. per square inch, and a minimum pressure of 151bs. The cylinder holds a gallon and-ahalf of disinfecting liquid, and when full weighs 281bs. The abolition of stripping in all cases (except in Small pox, which is done by the Works Department) has been a general saving. The adoption of spraying has been attended with success, 877 rooms having been so treated. The disinfector leaves one pound of soft soap at every room he sprays. 3,461 articles were destroyed by fire with the consent of the owners. 32,356 articles were disinfected by steam in the steam chambers, in addition to the wearing apparel of infectious disease contacts, and persons dealt with under the cleansing of Persons Act; and 10,308 articles were removed to the disinfecting station and fumigated in the specially constructed chamber. Underground Bakehouses.— Mr. Barth, the Inspector of Bakehouses, resigned in March, and the supervision of the alterations to the underground bakehouses was transferred to me, which necessitated 1,182 visits. The drains of these bakehouses were tested with Kemp's odour test, and defects, if found, remedied in most cases by reconstruction, the drainage work being supervised by the Inspector of the District. The baking room walls were rendered from floor to ceiling with a hard impervious material, the ceiling made dust proof, stall board and pavement ventilation abolished, windows opening on to areas abutting on the public way were provided with side pieces to form a hood, and so prevent dust from entering. Wherever possible no ventilation from the street (below 8 feet above ground level), however indirect, was allowed by the Council. When necessary, in addition to ordinary inlets and outlets, an air shaft was provided in the Bulkhead, terminating above the shop window, about facia level. It was found possible to carry these shafts up without reducing the window space, or injuring the design of the shop front; they answer the purpose of carrying off the steam and hot air near the oven, and were only fixed where the ovens are in the front of the premises. The stairways leading directly from the shop into the baking room are protected by a cabin hood, provided with a door, and a flap at floor level. The floors are of a hard, smooth, impervious material, well jointed. The lighting and ventilation of every underground bakehouse in the Borough has been improved by carrying out the requirements of the Council. The level bakehouses have been cleansed at the usual periods. Offensive Trades.— I paid 19 visits to offensive trade premises during the year, and found them in a satisfactory condition. Smoke Shafts.— I made 88 observations of smoke shafts, but owing to the underground bakehouse work, this work was transferred to the Inspector of Workplaces. I am, &c., W. Gr. Auger, Special Inspector. 58 § 2. OPEN SPACES AND ATMOSPHERE. Public Open Spaces.— The parks, gardens, and other open spaces secured against building operations in and adjoining St. Pancras, together with their situation, approximate area, and the authority under which they are maintained, are enumerated in the following table:— Sub-Districts.

Census, 1901. 60 The following information has been obtained by the Town Clerk, Mr. C. H. F. Barrett. The following Squares, &c., within the Borough are maintained by the inhabitants of such out of rates leviable as additional items of the General Rate by the Borough Council upon the precept served by a Committee elected by the inhabitants of each Square, &c.— Ampthill Square, Brunswick Square, Burton Crescent, Camden Gardens, Clarence Gardens, Fitzroy Square, Gordon Square, Harrington Square, Mecklenburgh Square, Mornington Crescent, Munster Square, Oakley Square, Regent Square, Rochester Terrace, &c., and Tavistock Square. The following Public Gardens are maintained by the Borough Council out of the General Rate, namely:— St. Andrew's Gardens, Gray's Inn Road, by Well Street. St. George's Gardens, Wakefield Street. St. James's Gardens, Hampstead Road. St. Martin's Gardens, Camden Street. St. Pancras Gardens, Pancras Road. Lismore Circus Garden, Gospel Oak. Pond Square Garden, Highgate College Garden, Great College Street. The undermentioned Open Spaces, the whole or part of which are situated in the Borough, are maintained by the London County Council, viz., Hampstead Heath, Parliament Hill Fields, Waterlow Park, and Whitefield Gardens, Tottenham Court Road. Regent's Park and Primrose Hill Park, portions of which are in St. Pancras, are maintained by the Crown. The Borough Council have no control over the undermentioned Squares and Open Spaces situated in the Borough:— Endsleigh Gardens, Euston Road. Owned by the Estate of the late Thomas Cubitt. Euston Square, Euston Road. Owned by the London and North Western Railway Company. Goldington Crescent Garden. The freeholders are the Duke of Bedford and the Brewers Company, and the Garden is leased to the occupiers of the houses in the Crescent. Argyle Square Garden, King's Cross. Owned by the proprietors of the Battle Bridge Estate, whose Agent is A.J. Dryland, Esq., No. 2, Guildhall Chambers, E.C. The Highgate Road Open Spaces are owned by Lord Dartmouth and others. Camden Square Garden is owned by the Marquis of Camden. The Crescent, Camden Road, is looked after by a Committee of the adjoining residents, the Secretary of which is Mr. Corderoy, of No. 167, Camden Road. 61 Leigh ton Crescent is controlled by a Committee of the adjoining residents, and the Secretary is Mr. Blunton, of No. 6, Leighton Crescent, N.W. The Crescent, Euston Street, is owned by the London and North Western Railway Company. The enclosed Gardens adjoining Regent's Park Terrace and Maitland Park Villas, are owned by adjoining owners of land, and are maintained by them. ATMOSPHERE. It is to be observed that in their effect upon the atmosphere and the population the two classes of open spaces produce opposite results. The open spaces planted with herbage, flowering plants, shrubs, and trees purify and cleanse the atmosphere, and afford the means of recreating and recruiting the health of the people surrounding them, and the only noises heard within them are the piping sounds of children's voices. The open spaces devoted to railway purposes are bare of vegetation and from them proceed the smoke of railway engines, the clanking of shunting trucks, the rumbling of trains, the vibration of heavy moving weights, the explosions of fog signals, shrill whistlings, and other disturbances of matter immensely conducive to the activities of the nation, but not to the health of the people immediately surrounding. In addition they form large enclosed areas inaccessible to the public, and obstructive to local traffic, transit, and inter-communication. What contribution outside the Parliamentary Acts of the Railway Companies does the nation make towards the health and well-being of the local community subjected to these ills, for the nation's welfare ? Smoke. — In the Annual Report for 1902 the enactments dealing with smoke were set out in full. There are 221 smoke shafts on the Register, 721 observations of these were taken, and 40 re-inspections were made after notices served. These observations or inspections and re-inspections occupy a considerable amount of time, as the intervals between stoking are of considerable duration - at least twenty minutes. Effluvia.— Of various businesses or places producing effluvia or offensive emanations there are 100 on the Registers, and of these 33 inspections and 30 reinspections were made. § 3. DWELLINGS. House-to-House Inquiries and Inspections. — (a) For the purpose of ascertaining the mode of sub-letting, 599 inquiries were made as to the occupation of houses in tenemented streets. (b) When the mode of sub-letting appears to be such as to necessitate periodical supervision of the sanitary condition of a house a complete enquiry is made into the mode of occupation of each room of the house. (c) When it has been decided to register a tenement house each room is measured as to its dimensions and capacity and recorded in the Register. 62 The following is the form (a) of preliminary report as to the mode of subletting tenement houses:— Sanitary Inspectors preliminary Report to Mtdical Officer of Health upon a Tenemented House or Street of Tenemented Houses. Street and number of House. Total No. of Rooms. Number of Dwellings of Total No. of Dwellings. No. of Shops, Stores, Workshops, &c. Underground Rooms. Dwellings let Furnished or Unfurnished. Let weekly, monthly, &c. General Appearance. Remarks and Names and Addresses of Persons to whom the rent is paid. 1 Room 2 Rooms 3 Rooms 4 Rooms 5 or more Rooms Number in House. Number slept in. The following is the form (b and c) of report as to (a) the result of Roomto-Room Inquiry in a Tenement House, and (b) the result of Room-to-Room measurement after it is resolved to register a Tenement House:— Report of Sanitary Inspector to Medical Officer of Health upon a Tenemented House, (a) the result of Room-to-Room Inquiry, (b) the result of Rnomto-Room measurement. Situation of House Name and Address of Landlord or Agent Situation of each Room. Measurements to be made after Registration has been resolved upon by the Council. For what purpose used, (Sleeping, Living, or Working). Number of Persons sleeping in each Room. Name of Tenant. Floor. Front or Back, Right or Left, or Additional, or N.E.W.S. Dimensions in feet. Males over 10. Females over 10. Children under 10. Total. Height. Length. Width. Cubic Capacity. (b) Tenement Houses.— During the year 200 inspections were made for the purpose of measuring tenement or lodging-houses which it had been decided to register, and at the end of year 2,000 houses were upon the register, 2 having ceased to be registerable, and 188 having been added to the register. Of these houses, 2,652 periodical half-yearly inspections were made, and 5,554 re-inspections after the service of notices. Also of the 212 dwellings entered in the register of Inscribed Dwellings 42 inspections were made, and 79 reinspections after the service of notices. 63 The following is the record relating to registered tenement houses:— On Register at end of 1903 1,814 Registered during 1904 188 Total 2,002 Ceased to be tenement houses 1904 2 On Register at end of 1904 2,000 (c) Underground Dwellings.— At the end of the year there was on the Register 576 underground rooms which had been illegally occupied as dwellings, and had been ordered to be closed, and of which 158 inspections had been made, and 1,116 re-inspections after notices served. The large number of re-inspections were due to the time allowed to the occupants of these rooms to find rooms elsewhere, and during the two to four months allowed the illegally o cupied rooms were kept under observation, and the number vacated or otherwise occupied were ascertained and reported. The houses in which these dwellings were found were added to the register of registered tenement houses. (d) Common Lodging Houses.— There are 25 Registered Common Lodging Houses in St. Pancras, and these are supervised by the London County Council, including the one Salvation Army Shelter in South St. Pancras. Rowton Houses are not so registered; of these there are in St. Pancras one at the southern end of King's Cross Road, and another, the building of which is nearly completed, at the northern end of Arlington Road in West St. Pancras. (e) Canal Boat Dwellings.— During the year 135 visits of inspection were paid to the 31 wharves on the Regent's Canal. On one occasion a girl over age was found living with her parents in the after cabin, and notice was served upon the owners to comply with the Regulations. (f) Working-Class Flats.— A list of the principal of these and the accommodation provided will be found in the Appendix to this Report. The East End Dwellings Company have erected working-class flats on the site of Peace Cottages and Speedy Place in Tollbridge Street and Cromer Street, known as Tonbridye Houses, where about 330 persons were displaced, and accommodation lias been provided for about 450 persons. Goldington Buildings, the working class flats erected by the Borough Council on the vacant site at the south end of Great College Street, N.W, adjoining the Royal Veterinary College, and opposite the Town Hall, were completed and opened in June last. The area of the site is 15,576 superficial feet. The area covered by buildings is 6,949 superficial feet, and the cubic capacity of the buildings is 405,123 cubic feet. A portion of the site is laid out as an open court yard, having an area of 8,527 superficial feet. The building is horse shoe in shape, and has a frontage length of 31 li feet. The buildings consist of 5 blocks, of which 4 contain 12 dwellings each, and the remaining block 8 dwellings, making a total of 56 dwellings, with 166 rooms. The number of persons that can be housed is 332 (which is ten more than required by the Order). The contract for the building was £17,778 lis. 5d , the cost per room £107 2s., and the cost per cubic foot l0½d. The domestic 64 and sanitary conveniences provided are—scullery and copper, open balcony, coal-bin and dust-bin, and w.c. Electric light is laid on and cupboards are provided. The dwellings are through ventilated, and there is 110 possible air communication between one dwelling and another, or between a w.c and a dwelling. The large courtyard contains a covered playing place for children, and the vista through the gateway towards the trees of Goldington Crescent with the granite fountain in the centre is particularly pleasing. Revenue Act, 1903.— Under the Act 48 Geo. III., c. 55—Schedule B.— Rules for charging Duties payable on Inhabited Dwelling Houses, Rule VI. provides that:— "Where any house shall be let in different storeys, tenements, lodgings, or landings, and shall be inhabited by two or more persons or families, the same shall nevertheless be subject to, and shall in like manner be charged to, the said duties as if such house or tenement was inhabited by one person or family only, and the landlord or owner shall be deemed the occupier of such dwelling house, and shall be charged to the said duties; provided that where the landlord shall not reside within the limits of the collector, or the same shall remain unpaid by such landlord for twenty days after the same is due, the duties so charged may be levied on the occupier or occupiers respectively, and such payments shall be deducted and allowed out of the next payment 011 account of rent." The Revenue Act, 1903 (3 Edw. VII., c. 56) provides further by Section 11, as follows:— "11.— (1) Where a house, so far as it is used as a dwelling house, is used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings:— (а) The value of any dwelling in the house which is of an annual value below £20 shall be excluded from the annual value of the house for the purposes of inhabited house duty; and (b) The rate of inhabited house duty in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual value of twenty pounds but not exceeding forty pounds shall be reduced to threepence; and (c) The rate of inhabited house duty in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual value exceeding forty pounds but not exceeding sixty pounds shall be reduced to sixpence. (2) The provisions of this section as respects dwellings of an annual value not exceeding forty pounds shall not take effect with regard to any such dwelling unless such a certificate as to accommodation and sanitary condition is produced to the General Commissioners as defined by section 5 of the Taxes Management Act, 1880, as is memioned in sub-section (2) of section 26 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890, and the provisions of that sub-section as to the certificate shall apply for the purpose." The Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890 (53 Vict., ch. 8), section (26) 2, provides that the assessment to inhabited house duty of any house 65 originally built or adapted by additions or alterations, and used for tlie sole purpose of providing separate dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding for each dwelling the rate of seven shillings and .sixpence per week (now an annual value of forty pounds), and occupied only by persons paying such rents, shall be discharged by the said Commissioners, provided that a certificate of the medical officer of health for the district in which the house is situate shall be produced to them to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements. The medical officer of health of a district, on request by the person who would be liable to pay the house duty on any house in the district, if the duty were not discharged as aforesaid, shall examine the house for the purpose of ascertaining whether such a certificate can be properly given, and if the house be constructed so as to afford such accommodation and due provision be made as aforesaid, shall certify the same accordingly. At a meeting of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, held on January 27th, 1905, the minimum requirements of the certificate, after previous consideration, were finally decided, and were published in the Journal, Public Health, March, 1905, p. 410, in this form— Revenue Act, 1903.— The following minimum requirements were approved, and it was recommended that any certificate to be given by the Medical Officer of Health, under Section 11 of the Revenue Act, 1903, should be, consequently, based thereon:— a. That a definite minimum height for living and sleeping rooms is provided, as defined by the London Building Act, 1894, together with a definite minimum area (superficial) of 96 feet for each of'sucli rooms b. That a fireplace and chimney-flue are provided for each living and sleeping room. c. That every living or sleeping room is sufficiently lighted by daylight, and properly ventilated. d. That each dwelling is so arranged as to be through-ventilated. e. That each dwelling is provided with a properly ventilated food cupboard (or recess) or larder, properly protected against flies and effluvia; and also a proper range or stove for cooking purposes. f. That there is a proper and sufficient supply of water available on each floor. g. That there is, at least, one w.c. properly supplied with water for every twelve occupants (or less), on each floor—each w.c. being disconnected aerially from any dwelling in the interior of the building. h. That on each floor a sufficient space, or open lobby, is provided, accessible to, and for the use of, the families on each floor, for the deposit of refuse, etc. i. That every common staircase is permanently ventilated at each floor level, or by through ventilation, so as to break the common air connection. 66 j. That corridors, or lobbies, within the building, whether external or internal to the dwellings, are all properly ventilated, and sufficiently lighted as far as practicable. k. That every internal court, open at the top and surrounded on all sides and situated wholly, or in part, within the building, is ventilated by a permanent opening, or openings, to the external air at the lower end—such opening, or openings, being of an area at least equal to l-20th the internal area of the court. I. That the drainage of the premises is in accordance with the Regulations and Bye laws recognised by the Authority, within whose jurisdiction the premises are situated. m. That accommodation for clothes-washing is provided, sufficient for the number of persons inhabiting the house. N.B.— In no case should a Medical Officer of Health examine a house (with separate dwellings), with a view to granting a certificate as to the aocommodation and sanitary condition, as required under Section 11 of the Revenue Act, 1903, until he is satisfied, as advised by the Local Government Boaid, that the house in question comes within the section of the Act. It was also resolved— "That a representation be made to the Local Government Board, urging that it is desirable that the plans of a new building intended to be constructed for occupation in separate dwellings, at rentals within the limits of Section 11 of the Revenue Act, 1903, should be submitted to the Medical Officer of Health before the building is erected, in order to avoid subjecting the Owner to the risk of a refusal of a certificate by waiting until after the completion of the building." (g) Housing of the Working Classes Act?. Part I.—Area No. 1 Somers Town. 1.— (a) Church way Scheme.— In continuation of the previous Annual Reports on this subject, Wellesley, Somerset, and Seymour Buildings are fully occupied, but the new roadway of Church way still awaits the removal of 146, 148, and 150, Euston Road fur the purpose of opening the roadway into Euston Road and converting the cul-de-sac into a thoroughfare. Part II.—Area No. 1 Somers lown (continued). 1.—(b) Part of area west of Chalton Street and north of Drummond Street line.— The houses here were dealt with individually under the Public Health Act some years ago. 1.— (c) Part of area east of Chalton Street.— In continuation of the history of the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place Improvement Schemes, 1890, Amendment Schemes, 1901, as related in the Annual Reports yearly since that of 1900, a further Inquiry was held by the Local Government Board in April, for the purpose of amending the schemes. 1.— (ci) Chapel Grove Scheme.— The further Inquiry in April into this scheme was mainly for the purpose of including three houses at the north end 67 of the area in the scheme, namely, Nos. 13, 15, and 17, Chapel Street, so as to enable a long block of dwellings to be built dow n the centre of the area, and to devote the southern portion of the area to other purposes, the shape of this portion of the site rendering it unavailable for the construction of dwellings. The scheme is now undergoing adjustment as to the incidence of expenditure, and am lgamation in the Eastnor Place Scheme, and the Order of the Local Government Board embodying the schemes is in course of preparation. 1.—(cii) Enntnor Place Scheme.— The further Inquiry in April into this scheme as into the Chapel Grove Scheme, was for the purpose of including four more houses at the north end of the area in the scheme, namely, Nos. 10, 14, 1(5, and 18, Phoenix Street (No. 12 being already in the scheme), so as to enable a long" block of dwellings to be constructed down the centre of the site. This scheme is also undergoing adjustment as to the incidence of expenditure, and amalgamation with the Chapel Grove Scheme, and the Order of the Local Government Board embodying the schemes is in course of preparation. Part II. Areas Nos. 2 and 3.—Prospect Terrace and Brantome Place Scheme. The following is the confirmation of the Order made by the Local Government Board in reference to these areas:— (15th February, 1904.) To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras;— To the County Council of the Administrative County of London;— And to all others whom it may concern. W iiereas by an Order dated the 7th day of December, 1901 (hereinafter referred to as "the Order"), We, the Local Government Board, in pursuance of the powers given to us by the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"'), sanctioned, subject to the requirements, conditions, and modifications set forth in the Order, two Schemes made by the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Pancras, under Sub-section (1) (b) of Section 39 of the Act for the improvement of certain areas in the said parish known as the Brantome Place area and the Prospect Terrace area; And whereas the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Saint Pancras hereinafter referred to as "the Borough Council") are, as the successors of the said Vestry in relation to the said Metropolitan Borough, the Local Authority for the purposes of Part II. of the Act; And whereas the Order requires confirmation and We are satisfied that the Order has been duly published by the Borough Council in accordance with Sub-section (4) of Section 39 of the Act, that two months after such publication have expired, and that the only petition which has been presented to ITs against the Order has been withdrawn; Now therefore, in pursuance of the Act, We do hereby Confirm the Order. Given under the Seal of Office of the Local Government Board, this Fifteenth day of February, in the year One thousand nine hundred and four. Walter H. Long, President. II. G. Monro, Assistant Secretary. 68 The condition of the three sites embraced in the Order is now as follows: — (a) Great College Street site.— On this additional vacant site included in the Order of the Local Government Board for the purpose of housing part of the persons to be displaced from Brantome Place and Prospect Terrace, Goldington Buildings have been erected and are now fully occupied. These buildings have been described above under the head of (f) Working Class Flats, and accommodate 332 persons or 10 more than required by the Order. (b) Brantome Place area.— During the year the Public Health Committee and the Housing Sub-Committee have been engaged in endeavouring to obtain information as to cheaper and more self contained types of dwellings than those attached to the Order, so that they may be let at lower rentals and insure greater privacy in the homes. All the interests on the area have been acquired and demolition is proceeding. (c) Prospect Terrace area.— The rentals of the rooms in the existing houses on this area have been revised and reduced, and the basement rooms unfit for habitation have been vacated (sec Minutes 22nd February, 1905, p. 311). All the interests have been acquired except those in the Prospect Terrace roadway which have been referred to arbitration. In the Order the number of persons to be displaced from these two areas is 1,165, and the number to be rehoused on the three sites is 842 persons.

At the 66 grant-receiving schools, 18 inspections and 1 re-inspection were made during the year by the Woman Inspector. § 5.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. % Factories.—The Man Inspector had 341 and the Woman Inspector 102 factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water-service, sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During the year 63 and 29 inspections of factories, respectively, were made, and 6 re-inspections after notices served. Workshop*.—The Man Inspector had 802 and the Woman Inspector 385 workshops (apart from bakehouses) on the Registers for periodical inspection. During the year 284 and 173 inspections, respectively, of these premises were made, and 59 and 10 re-inspections after notices. Workplaces.—These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, laundries and domestic workshops, and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaces.—The Woman Inspector has 226 of these on the Register, of which 98 inspections and 1 re-inspection after notice were made. These places vary in number from year to year, and according to the season of the year. Laundries.—On the Register are 90 laundries at which the Woman Inspector made 57 inspections and 7 re-inspections. Restaurant Kitchens.—Of these the Man Inspector had 63 and the Woman Inspector 157 on the Registers. At the former 8 inspections and 3 re-inspections were made, and at the latter 14 inspections and 1 re-inspection. Bakehouses.—At the commencement of the year there were 178 workshop bakehouses. Of these and of the three factory bakehouses, and the three bakehouses in hotels, 202 inspections and 1157 re-inspections were made. This large number of re-inspections was part of the work in connection with certifying underground bakehouses. On the 30th December, 1903, the Home Secretary made an Order (No. 1157) directing that as regards bakehouses (other than such as are underground) where work is carried on at night (9 p.m. to 6 a m.) by artificial light other than electric light "four hundred cubic feet of space to every person" shall be allowed instead of the "two hundred and fifty" provided for workshops in section 3 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. (See Annual Report, 1903 —Legislation.) 70 By the interpretation section, 141 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, "the expression 'bakehouse' means any place in which are baked bread, biscuits, or confectionery, from the baking or selling of which a profit is derived." Underground Bakehouses.—Section 101 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, which relates specially to underground bakehouses has "effect as if it were included among the provisions relating to bakehouses which are referred to in section 26 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891." By the same section 101 an underground bakehouse is defined as "a bakehouse, any baking room of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room, and the expression 'baking room' means any room used for baking, or for any process incidental thereto." By the same section it is provided that an underground bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the Council to be suitable for that purpose, and shall not be certified as suitable unless the Council is satisfied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects. On the the 30th December, 1903, the Home Secretary made an Order (No. 1157) directing that as regards underground bakehouses "five hundred cubic feet of space to every person" shall be allowed instead of the "two hundred and fifty" provided for workshops in section 3 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In accordance with these provisions, minimum requirements for underground bakehouses were framed on general lines, and applied to each individual bakehouse as the circumstances of the case demanded. UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSES. Minimum Requirements. (1) Cubic capacity.—At least a thousand cubic feet. (2) Square space.—At least one hundred and fifty square feet of floor space. (3) Height.—At least seven feet from floor to ceiling or roof. (4) Level of ceiling or roof.—Not more than one foot below the level of the street. (5) Open space or area on one of 1he sides of the bakehouse or an open roof. (6) Floor of hard, even, smooth, impervious material, and in good condition. (7) Walls of hard, even, smooth, impervious material, and in good condition. (8) Ceiling impervious to dust and dirt and in good condition. Any opening in the ceiling for the purpose of passing up bread, &c., to be closed by a tightfitting trap door and protected by a cabin hood and door or similar form of protection. (9) Admission of fresh air. — One or more windows or skylights opening directly into the external air of at least twelve square feet in area, an I so made as to be entirely opened with facility. Removal of the partition between a front and back basement room so as to open up the bakehouse to the-remaining window or windows, and to any open area or other open space. 71 (10) Exclusion of foul air.—Any coal or other cellar shut off and ventilated into the open air independently of the bakehouse. (11) Exclusion of external dust and dirt.—Every opening so situated and so devised as to be protected from dust and dirt blown or falling from the street. No direct pavement, stallboard, or dwarf area ventilation into the bakehouse, and any window, fanlight, or door in a front area, to be protected either by hooded or winged sashes, or by a horizontal covering, or by a lean-to glass roof, so placed as not to obstruct the entrance of light and air, but to intercept any fallen or blown dust and dirt from the street, and any door to be automatically self closing. (12) Extraction of fumes, effluvia, &c.—By outlet ventilators into any disused flues, a valve or door into the oven flue, and an extraction or upcast shaft in the bulkhead or space over the oven, terminating at least eight feet above the street level if situated in front of the premises. (13) Generalty.—Compliance with the statutory requirements applicable to all bakehouses. At the end of the year 1903 there were 136 underground bakehouses in use. During 1904 certificates were granted to 93 of these, refused to 8, and still under consideration in regard to 35. Of these bakehouses, 8 having ceased to be used at the end of the year 1904, there were 128 still in use. During the first quarter of 1905, in regard to the 35 remaining underground bakehouses, 25 certificates were granted and 10 refused. Of these 10 bakehouses, 6 are upon the estates of the Foundling Hospital and the Skinners' Company, who intend to cause the houses to be rebuilt at the end of the leases, which will soon expire. In the Appendix is a complete list of the bakehouses, showing which are underground, what is baked in them, which have been certified, and which refused certificates, or otherwise disused. Plans of all the underground bakehouses were made as the first step in dealing with them, and this caused some delay, but the delay was worth incurring, as now that the plans have had shown upon them the alterations that have been made, a complete account and plan is on record of every underground bakehouse in St. Pancras at the time the certificate was granted. It is interesting to note that six bakehouses in St. Pancras had two ovens in different baking rooms forming part of the same premises. Premises. Two Baking Rooms. 4, South Grove 1 Under ground—Certificate refused. 1 Level. 7, Willow Walk 1 Underground—Certificate refused. 1 Level. 24, Gower Place 1 Underground in Gower Street—Certificate refused. 1 Underground in Gower Place—Certificate granted. 72 Premises. Two Baking Rooms. 117, Tottenham Court Road 1 Underground in Tottenham Court Road— Certificate refused. 1 Underground in Grafton Street—Certificate refused. 125, High Street 1 Level at East end of covered yard at rear. 1 „ at West „ „ 135, Judd Street 1 Underground in Judd Street—Certificate refused. 1 Underground in Bidborough Street—Certificate refused. There may also be two ovens in one baking room, either on the same level, or one over the other, the latter being known as two-decker ovens. It is also interesting to observe that there were five bakehouses, the baking rooms of which were under the public way, as follows:— Premises. Alterations. 84, Cromer Street Oven removed to another part of the bakehouse; partition removed, and baking room thrown open to back area. 31, Princess Road Recessed open area made at rear. 72, Stanhope Street Open area sunk and formed at side of baking room. 48, Chalk Farm Road Front cellar converted into partly open recessed area. 83, Gray's Inn Road Oven removed to another part of the bakehouse; partition removed and baking room thrown open to front area.

Detailed reports dealing with this subject have already been submitted to you. 76 The reduction in the number of inspections made is explained by the pressure of this special work which has involved not only numerous visits, but also a considerable mass of clerical and statistical work. I do not anticipate any inquiry to the interests of our working women from this temporary relaxation of inspection of their work premises; but I think it would be unwise to allow this intermission of inspection to continue too long, and so, while continuing to work upon the inquiry as opportunity permits, I am endeavouring also to resume the industrial work. I append the collection of statistics required by the Secretary of State. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, M. E. Bibby. Sanitary Inspector of Workshops (Women.) APPENDIX.

WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICE. The condition of the water supplied in the New River Water District and the West Middlesex Water District, has been reported in the quarterly reports as extracted from the Reports of the Analyst of the Local Government Board. Regulations of Writer Companies, now the Water Board.—The Borough Council exercise within the Borough, conjointly with the County Council, the powers under Sections 17 to 25 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1871. These Sections provide that every Company shall make Regulations for preventing undue consumption or contamination of water, and, under Section 26 of the Metropolis Water Act of 1852, for preventing the waste or misuse of water, and amongst other things to prescribe the size, nature and strength of the pipes, cocks, cisterns, and other apparatus to be used, and to interdict any arrangements and the use of any pipes, cocks, cisterns, or other apparatus which may tend to such waste or misuse. Any Company may repeal or alter any Regulation or make new Regulations instead. The Metropolitan Authority, the London County Council, now also the Borough Council, or any ten consumers may be requested in writing to repeal or alter any Regulation or make new instead, and upon refusal the Local Government Board may hold Inquiry and make such Regulation, repeal, or alteration, as they think fit. Penalties of a sum not exceeding £5 may be imposed for any offence against the Regulations. Within four days after making repeal or alteration of a Regulation notice must be served upon the Borough Council by the Company. No Regulation, repeal or alteration is valid until confirmed by the Local Government Board, who may institute Inquiry if they think fit, and must hear the County Council, the Borough Council, and the Company, and the Board may then confirm or disallow any Regulation, repeal or alteration, one month's notice in writing and by advertisement having been given of the Public Inquiry. A printed copy of the Regidations must be kept at the office of the County Council, the Borough Council, and the Company for public perusal. By the Metropolis Water Act, 1902, the undertakings, liabilities, and obligations of the Metropolitan Water Companies were transferred to the Water Board. 78 § 7.—DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. Drainage Register.—The following is an analysis of the Drainage Register during 1904:— Total number of Applications and Plans 898 Number of Applications without Plans 215 Number of Plans 683 898 Plans—Old Buildings, under Notice 454 Plans—Old Buildings, Voluntary 213 683 Plans—New Buildings and additions 16 Revised form for Drain Plans.—In consequence of the By-laws made by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, the Metropolis Management Acts Amendment (By-laws) Act, 1899, requiring persons about to construct, reconstruct, or alter pipes, drains, or other means of communicating with a sewer or traps or apparatus connected therewith, to deposit with the sanitary authority, in duplicate, the plans, sections and particulars of the proposed construction, etc., being confirmed, a revised form for the making of drain plans was approved by the Borough Council. Unstopping of Private Drains.—It frequently happens that an owner or occupier complains not that the drain but that the sewer is choked, and so the complaint goes to the Works Department, but it is often found that the drain is stopped, and so the drain is unstopped by the Council's officers and servants at the expense of the rates. This practice penalises the owner who does his own work. It was decided that in all cases where the drain is unstopped by the Works Department, the owner should pay a fee for the work done, and that where application is made to the Works Department to unstop a drain and the work is to be done by the Council's officers and servants the owner be required to pay the cost. Combined Drainage.—The position with regard to combined drainage appears to be as follows:—If a tube, pipe, or conduit carry the drainage of more than one premises it is de facto a sewer and becomes vested in the local authority, and thej' cannot divest themselves of the responsibility for its perpetual maintenance as there is no provision in law to effect this. On the other hand, if the drainage of one premises be newly discharged into the drain of a second premises the second drain becomes a sewer, and unless the local authority take action against the person converting the drain into a sewer within six months of the offence there is no remedy. So that the ultimate position appears to be that a sewer cannot be converted into a drain, as once a sewer always a sewer, whereas a drain may be converted into a sewer at any moment and at the end of six months after conversion becomes a sewer in perpetuity. Proposed Legislation as to Combined Drainage.—Attention was directed to the fact that when premises within one curtilage are sub-divided into premises within two or more curtilages the existing drain takes the drainage of more than one premises. This sub division takes place without the knowledge or sanction of the Borough Council and subsequently the drain becomes a sewer. 79 There is only one method of preventing a liability for private premises of this kind being thrown upon the public rates, namely, by making it compulsory for the owner to provide and deposit with the Sanitary Authority plans of the whole of the sub-divided premises, and of the whole of the drainage, and that if not so deposited within three months of the sub-division taking place and sanctioned by the Sanitary Authority, the Sanitary Authority to have the power, if considered necessary, to compel the owner to put in separate drains to the sewer. A communication was addressed to the London County Council asking them to promote legislation to effect the object in view, and a communication was addressed to the Metropolitan Borough Councils directing their attention to the matter and asking them to support the action of the St. Pancras Borough Council.

The Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 44.—Power to Sanitary Authority to provide public conveniences.— (1) Every sanitary authority may provide and maintain public lavatories and ash-pits, and public sanitary conveniences other than privies, in situations where they deem the same to be required, and may supply such lavatories and sanitary conveniences with water, and may defray the expense of providing such lavatories, ash-pits, and sanitary conveniences, and of any damage occasioned to any person by the erection or construction thereof, and the expense of keeping the same in good order, as if they were expenses of sewerage. (2) For the purpose of such provision the subsoil of any road, exclusive of the footway adjoining any building or the curtilage of a building, shall be vested in the Sanitary Authority. 45.—Regulations as to public sanitary conveniences.—(1) Where a Sanitary Authority provide and maintain eny public lavatories, ash-pits, or sanitary conveniences such Authority may— (a) Make regulations with respect to the management thereof, and bylaws as to the decent conduct of persons using the same; and (b) Let the same for any term not exceeding three years at such rent and subject to such conditions as they may think fit; and (c) Charge such fees for the use of any lavatories or water-closets provided by them as they may think proper. (2) No public lavatory, ash-pit, or sanitary convenience shall be erected in or accessible from any street without the consent in writing of the Sanitary Authority, who may give their consent upon such terms as to the use thereof or the removal thereof at any time, if required by the Sanitary Authority, as they may think fit. (3) If any person erects a lavatory, ash-pit, or sanitary convenience in contravention of this Section, and after notice to that effect served by the Sanitary Authority does not remove the same, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five' pounds, and to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings for every day during which the offence continues after a conviction for the offence. (4) Nothing in this Section shall extend to any lavatory or sanitary convenience now or hereafter erected by any Railway Company within their railway station, yard, or the approaches thereto. Note.—Sub-sections 3 and 4 of this Section control also the erection of new public sanitary conveniences by private owners. The London County Council General Powers Act, 1904. 22.—If any sanitary convenience now or hereafter erected in or accessible from any street in any Sanitary District shall be so placed or constructed as 81 to be (1) a nuisance or (2) offensive to public decency, the Sanitary Authority of that district, by notice in writing, may require the owner to remove such convenience or otherwise to re-construct the same in such a manner and with such materials as may be required to abate the nuisance and remove the offence against public decency. Any owner who fails within a reasonable time to comply with a notice under this Section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of five pounds, and to a further fine not exceeding twenty shillings for every day during which he makes default in complying with the requirements of such notice after such conviction. § 8 REFUSE REMOVAL Cleansing of Stable Yank.—When a stable yard is in one occupation there is no difficulty in causing the yard to be properly cleansed and maintained, but when there are several occupiers, and the yard is used in common, it becomes nobody's business to cleanse and repair it. Section 120 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, enables an authority to institute proceedings against any one or more persons who have jointly or in common failed to abate a nuisance, and they may be prohibited from any continuing default in abating such a nuisance. The difficulty of carrying out this section is to prove who is or are the person or persons causing the nuisances by their acts or defaults; for instance, it is not an uncommon thing for a costermonger to get rid of his garbage by throwing it into a stable yard, and if the occupier opposite whose stable it is deposited neglects to remove it, and can prove that he did not deposit it there, no conviction can be obtained. In order to enforce the cleansing and repair of stable yards where there are several occupiers, it requires a clause defining the liability similar to the clause in the By-laws for Houses let in Lodgings to separate families. That where one person is entitled to the exclusive use of a stable yard the occupier shall cause the cleansing and repairing to be done, and when two or more occupiers are entitled to the use in common, the landlord shall cause them to be done, the landlord being defined as the person (whatever may be the nature or the extent of his interest in the premises) by whom or on whose behalf the stable or stables arc let out to the actual occupiers thereof, and who for the time being receives or is entitled to receive the profits arising from such letting. It follows, therefore, that there may be several landlords, and if so, a further provision must be made that it shall be the duty of each landlord to ascertain the area and extent of his liability, and to agree upon this with the authority and the other landlords in order that the officers of the authority may be able to call upon the proper person to do the necessary works, and failing to give information upon which an agreement could be come to, he should be made liable, and to a continuing penalty for a continuing default. § 9.—NUISANCES. Urgent Dangerous Nuisances.—As to the Service of Intimations and Statutory Notices.—If after the service of an Intimation by the Inspector for the abatement of a nuisance the nuisance remains unabated, it was necessary to wait often several weeks for the instruction of the Committee to serve a Statutory Notice and to enforce abatement by the Order of the Court. This caused 82 serious delay in the abatement of urgent dangerous nuisances, such as "cut off or stopped water supply," and "choked or stopped water closets and drains." The Sanitary Authority have no power to enter and forthwith abate an urgent dangerous nuisance, and it has been decided that if the Authority enter they do so at their own risk and cannot recover any expenses for the abatement of the nuisance until alter the Order of the Court has been made. If the Authority made it a practice to enter before the Order of the Court owners would leave urgent dangerous nuisances to be abated at public expense, an item that would progressively increase. Under the circumstances, and in order to reduce the delay of weeks to days, and if possible to hours, it was recommended and approved that in cases of urgent dangerous nuisances Intimations be served to abate such nuisances forthwith, and that, in default, it be an instruction to the Chief Clerk to sign and cause to bo servel Statutory Notices for abatement forthwith, and in default of compliance to obtain such Order of the Court as may be necessary for the immediate abatement of the nuisance. Regent's Canal Water.—Eight specimens of water, taken from various parts of the Regent's Canal within the Borough, were sent for analysis to Sir Thomas Stevenson, M.D. The general tenor of his reports upon these specimens of water was that though the water was sewage polluted, the contamination was not such as to cause a nuisance, and so was not injurious to health. § 10.—SUMMONSES. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (except in respect of Food), the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and the Metropolis Local Management Acts. Situation of Property. Offence.

V.-FOOD. §1.—FOOD PREMISES. The dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops, the slaughterhouses, the places where raw foods are prepared, and the marketing places have been regularly visited and inspected. The markets and marketing streets have also been regularly visited on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the summer months. Bakehouses, restaurant kitchens, and similar workplaces fall under the Factory and Workshop Acts, and have been dealt with under Part IV. of this Report. 84 § 2.—UNWHOLESOME FOOD. Conditions of sale of food at wholesale markets.—In the early part of the year, enquiries were made by letters to certain wholesale markets as to the sale of food substances in London. It was ascertained that the usual procedure is for the food substances to be brought to the markets by companies or owners in greater or less bulk, for the bulk to be broken by Brokers or Salesmen, and for these to sell again to the retailers. It was further ascertained that the sales take place at the risk of the purchasers, that the sellers do not give any guarantee as to weight or quality, and that it would be impossible to carry on business in these markets if every package bad to be re-sorted before selling, but buyers are given every opportunity for examination. Furthermore, it is the custom of the markets that persons purchasing damaged goods do so with a full knowledge that they are buying and paying for the good portions only. UNWHOLESOME MILK. Food may be unhealthy on two main grounds—firstly, that it may be injurious to health by reason of the addition of preservatives, colouring, or other matters, and secondly, that it may be unfit for human consumption and unwholesome by reason of disease, unsoundness, or contamination. The words "injurious to health" and "unwholesome" appear to be merely different expressions meaning the same thing. Those in the first category are controlled by the Food and Drugs Acts, and those in the second by the Public Health Acts. Now, the procedure under these two Acts is totally different. Under the former, samples of food are purchased or taken by an Inspector, and if upon analysis or examination a sample is found to contain some harmful addition, the vendor or consignor is liable to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds. Under the latter, an Inspector may inspect and examine any food sold, or exposed, or deposited for sale, or for preparation for sale, and in his brief inspection and examination he must determine whether, in his opinion, the food is diseased, unsound, or contaminated. These unwholesome conditions may be visible or invisible; if visible the Inspector may seize the food and obtain its condemnation and destruction by order of a Justice; if invisible or unascertainable by immediate inspection and examination upon the spot, the law provides no protection for the public. This position is borne out by the opinion given by Mr. Courthope Munroe to the Public Health Committee in February, 1900, when he explained that a sample of milk having been purchased and found by bacteriological examination unwholesome, no action could be taken under the Food and Drugs Acts, because there was no adulteration by addition or by abstraction, and no action could be taken under the Public Health Act because no seizure and condemnation had taken place, and these steps are essential in order to ground an offence. This opinion was given after the microscopical and bacteriological examination of certain samples of milk taken in St. Pancras, in 1899 and 1900, showing that they were dirty, contained an excessive number of microbes, excessive number of leucocytes, pus in smaller or greater amounts, tubercle bacilli, blood, or that coagulation had begun. 85 In many other parts of London and England, samples have also been taken and similarly examined with similar results. I.—With regard to tubercle bacilli and the streptococci of pus, the former is taken as evidence of tuberculous affection, and the latter of inflammatory condition of the udder of the cow, and these can be almost eliminated by the careful veterinary examination of cows. The London County Council, since 1899, has caused the cows in London cowsheds to be periodically examined by their Veterinary Inspectors under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts with good results, and if all other Local Authorities outside London could have sufficient pressure brought to bear upon them to cause similar periodical and careful examination to be made by Veterinary Inspectors, these two sources of unwholesomeness would almost disappear. II.—With regard to the dirtiness of milk and to the presence of an excessive number of micro-organisms, these conditions may be due to a variety of causes during the numerous different stages through which milk passes in its journeyings from the udder of the cow in a distant country farm to the consumer in a city. The only kind of control that appears practically exercisable over the cleanliness of milk is the enforcement of some standard of the maximum amount of dirt permissible. The total exclusion of microbes is impossible, and even the partial exclusion is a difficult matter to deal with in a direct way, but in an indirect manner the excessive number of organisms now commonly present may be reduced. These organisms are introduced from without in company with dust and dirt, and they multiply themselves in direct ratio with the rise of temperature in milk exposed to air and sun, and with the length of time that the milk remains unconsumed. Therefore the factors to be dealt with are temperature, freshness, and cleanliness The effects of temperature require to be mitigated mainly in warm weather by protection from the direct rays of the sun during summer, supplemented by additional cooling during the dog-days. The stateness of milk is brought about by excessive delays and distances of transit; curtailment of these will ensure greater freshness, or special means of cooling in special receptacles or conveyances will effect the same object. But unfortunately, instead of protecting milk against heat and delay, preservatives more or less injurious to health are added to milk, substituting an invisible injury for the visible or appreciable injuries of sourness or decomposition, by which the purchaser can judge for himself. This is deception, as if it were totally prohibited to add preservatives to milk, as recommended by the Departmental Committee of the Local Government Board in its Report of January, 1901, in the absence of preservatives milk improperly cared for would become recognisably unfit for consumption much sooner than milk properly cared for. If then some standard of the extraneous solid contents permissible in milk sold to the public were adopted, it would be possible for Sanitary Authorities to exercise control over the cleanliness of milk. Such control would cause retailers to more carefully protect their milk, and the influence of this impulse to greater cleanliness would be carried backwards through the numerous stages far away to the cow whence the milk is originally derived. 86 But this control must commence at the last stage, namely, that at which it is sold to the public. To commence at the other end, that is, at the cow, and to officially supervise all the numerous details in the manipulation of milk until it reaches the consumer would require an immense number of Inspectors and be a most costly task, and would also require public authorities to prescribe so many complicated regulations as to the conduct of the business and the provision of plant, implements, &c., as to become intolerable. If one could conceive a system bv which milk could be drawn in a cleanly manner from a healthlv cow's udder directly into a clean bottle, immediately stoppering and remaining stoppered until it reached the consumer, the matter would be very simple; such an ideal does not exist, and we have to deal with conditions as we find them. The only practical remedy is a limit to the amount of extraneous matter found, at the point of ultimate sale, upon analysis. III.—The infections of typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and epidemic sore throat, have from time to time been conveyed in milk from country farms and dairies, and caused epidemics. With a view to rapidly discovering the source of these and promptly arresting them, inquiry was made in 1902 as to the sources of supply of every milk retailer in St. Pancras, and almost without exception the information was freely given when it was explained that the object was not only to protect the public, but also the milk retailers in St. Pancras against the importation of infection into the Borough, by tracing it rapidly to its source and stopping it there should the occasion arise. This information is tabulated and is available for reference at a moments notice, and will be kept corrected as nearly as possible up to date. The law to prevent the spread of dangerous infectious disease by milk is cumbersome to enforce in its present form, but it could be greatly simplified. Tn all cases of dangerous infectious diseases that are notified, inquiry is made, amongst other matters, into the milk supply of the patient. It is only in this manner that the milk of a particular vendor may become suspected, and further inquiry in this direction will negative or reasonably confirm the suspicion. If the evidence is sufficiently strong to justify the suspicion of the milk of a particular vendor, it is then usual to forthwith inform him, to ascertain the state of health of his staff and condition of his premises, and to at once trace out the implicated milk and advise him to cease distributing it—advice that he is only too anxious to follow to protect his own business. If the inquiry prove that there is no suspicion attached to his staff or premises, he will in his own defence cease to receive the implicated milk, and so far as the particular area is concerned the spread of infection will be stayed. There is also a cumbersome legal procedure by which the Sanitary Authority may officially exclude the implicated milk from its own area, but this does not prevent the middleman or farmer from sending it elsewhere. What is required is the power to very heavily mulct a farmer, middleman, or other vendor of milk who can be proved to have spread infectious disease through milk within a certain time after having been informed in writing by a Medical Officer of Health that his milk has been ascertained to have spread infectious disease. 87 As, under the General Order of the Local Government Board, it is the duty of a Medical Officer of Health to give immediate information to the Local Government Board and to the County Council of any outbreak of dangerous infectious disease, it follows that at the same time as he informs the vendor, middleman, or farmer that he has evidence that his milk is spreading dangerous infectious disease, that he must also inform the County Council and the Local Government Board. If, therefore, the infected milk be sent to another part of the same county and cause a fresh outbreak, the County Council would possess the necessary evidence to prosecute; if sent into a different county the Local Government Board would possess the evidence necessary for prosecution. Legislation is therefore necessary to provide that where a vendor, purveyor, or producer of milk has been informed in writing by a Medical Officer of Health that there is evidence to show that his milk has been the means of spreading dangerous infectious disease, and has been advised to discontinue its distribution and he does not forthwith cease to distribute such milk, and it be proved that he has continued to distribute such milk either in the same or in another district or county, or other counties, and there to further spread dangerous infectious disease, he shall be liable to prosecution at the instance of the District, Borough, or County Council, or Local Government Board, according to whether the said distribution has taken place in one or more districts, boroughs, or counties. The following resolutions were passed by the Borough Council on the 21st September, 1904:— 1.—That the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture be urged to take such steps as will ensure the better enforcement of the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders, and the Regulations made thereunder, outside the Metropolis. 2.—That, in respect of the Metropolis, the Local Government Board be urged to carry out their statutory powers as laid down in Section 28 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 3.—That the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture be requested to obtain legislative powers to make regidations for the more sanitary means and methods of transit and storage of milk. 4.—That the Local Government Board be written to suggesting that all milkshops and milkstores be required, under penalty, to be licensed annually, as is the case at present with all cowsheds, and that no person or persons be allowed to sell milk unless the premises at which such milk is sold and stored have been previously certified as "suitable" by the Sanitary Authority for the District. 5.—That to secure united action amongst the Metropolitan Borough and City Councils a communication be sent to each of them stating the above recommendations made by the Lambeth Borough Council. 88 Food destroyed.—The following food, unfit for human consumption, was destroyed during the year:— Date.

Adulterated Milk.—Wholesomeness is a question of health, and adulteration and substitution mainly a question of fraud. Foreign Milk.—It appeared that during 1901 some 8 cwts. of foreign fresh milk were sent from Norway to the port of Newcastle, some 11 cwts. from Holland, and 4 cwts. from Victoria, Australia, to the port of London, and some 14,500 cwts. from France to the port of Southampton. These appeared to be experimental attempts to import fresh milk into England, and the milk that passed through Southampton in 100-gallon drums was sent to London and to a St. Pancras firm in a frozen state. In 1903 some hundreds of cwts. of milk were in addition sent from France to Newliaven, but as during that year the total quantity imported into England was considerably less, the experiments did not appear to be very successful. Questions asked in the House of Commons in March and April, 1903, by Sir Edward Stracliey, elicited similar information with additional details. The Customs Officials take samples of these milks so that their quality is under control, and unless some harmless mode of preservation is successful there is little probability of any great increase of importation at present. Country Milk.—In 1902 inquiries were made into the milk passing through the railway stations and depots in St. Pancras, and the quantities consigned respectively by each of the numerous consignors in the country to each of the numerous consignees in London. In the same year inquiry was also made of every milk retailer in St. Pancras as to the sources of his supply. Thus from both ends a practically complete record was obtained of the milk supply of St. Pancras. In 1903 inquiry was made of the Medical Officers of Health 90 of the Metropolitan Boroughs as to the railway stations at which milk is delivered in their districts and the amount delivered daily. From the replies kindly made by them the table appended hereto was compiled. In 6 of the London Boroughs no milk was delivered by rail, in 3 the quantity was unknown, and in 20 the quantity was approximately known. The known quantity delivered was about 157,000 imperial gallons, and if 3000 be allowed for the unknown quantity, it is probable that about 160,000 imperial gallons of milk were delivered by rail in London daily. In 1891 Mr. R. Henry Rew estimated the total London milk supply at 133,000 gallons per day (Trans. Roy. Stat. Soc., April, 1892). In 1885 Messrs. A. Wynter Blyth and Alfred Spencer estimated the average daily supplv of London at 110,000 gallons, including in round numbers about 84,000 gallons by rail, 1000 by road, 23,000 from London cowsheds, and 2,000 miscellaneous (Trans. Soc. Med. Offs. Health, February, 1886). From this it would appear that the quantity of rail-borne milk will have doubled in twenty years, and the quantity of town produced milk have diminished to one fourth of its former amount. Town A!ilk.—The London cowsheds are licensed for over 6000 cows, and probably occupied by, at the most, 4000. If each cow yields at least a gallon and a half a day this represents 6000 imperial gallons of town produced milk daily. London is now completely surrounded by suburban towns which probably consume the greater part of the milk they produce, and it is probable that the road-borne milk coming into London is small in quantity, and that some of this is compensated for by the milk sent from London cowsheds on the borders into localities just beyond the London area. Milk-dealers.—In the London Directory there are some two dozen wholesale dairymen; some of these firms are solely wholesale dealers and others are both wholesale and retail dealers. Not 20 per cent. of retailers, and none of the smallest retailers, are served directly by farmers, and probably over 80 per cent. of retailers are served by intermediate dealers through first hand, second hand, and even third hand re-sale, according to the quantity sold by the retailer. Of 468 dairymen in St. Pancras distributing milk by retail, about 309 appear to sell less than a gallon or two a day, about 76 a churn or two a day, about 54 several churns a day, and about 29 a van load of churns or more a day. In other words, two-thirds of the dairymen sell small quantities of milk, mostly from counter-pans in small general shops, and never receive a churn. Sampling Milk for Analysis. — For the purpose of analysis, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, about three-fourths of the samples that are taken are usually of dairy produce, about one-fourth being samples of butter and twofourths samples of milk. Milk is by far the most important article controlled as to adulteration, and about one half of the samples taken under the Acts consist of fresh cow's milk. The Food and Drugs Acts provide for the sampling of milk in transit when sold wholesale, and for the purchase of samples of milk when sold retail. When sold wholesale, in transit samples may be taken at railway stations upon delivery from the farmer or producer to the wholesale dealer, or on delivery from one wholesale dealer to another or to the retailer, but if found adulterated 91 no prosecution can ensue unless a warranty of the consignor is produced by the consignee, because the law does not assume that the milk is intended for human consumption, or that it should necessarily be pure whole milk that has been purchased unless explicitly shown. When sold retail, samples may be purchased over the counter or from the cart, barrow, or can, and then the law does not question whether the milk is sold for human consumption, but assumes that it must be pure whole milk. Sampling Milk sold by Fanners or Producers.—As far back as the commencement of 1891, experience was gained of the genuineness of milk delivered at the railway stations in St. Pancras. In addition to the samples taken from specified churns at the request of the milk dealers, other samples were taken promiscuously from amongst the churns sent up by farmers from the country. The result was that, of 100 consecative samples taken, prosecutions followed in live cases. Of the 100 consecutive samples, 83 were taken promiscuously, and 17 specially at the request of wholesale dealers; from the 83 promiscuous samples there followed only one prosecution, equal to 1.2 per cent.; amongst the 17 wholesale dealers' special samples there were four prosecutions, equal to 23*5 per cent. During the whole of 1891 there were altogether 35 samples taken upon the requests of wholesale dealers at railway stations, and these resulted in 10 prosecutions, equal to 28.6 per cent. It must be remembered that wholesale dealers only request, samples to be taken when they have already ascertained in rougu and ready tests or by analysis that they are receiving adulterated milk, and that doubt was thrown only upon 35 of the many thousands upon thousands of churns passing through the railway stations in St. Pancras in the course of a year showed that farmers' milk was seldom adulterated. Daring the whole of the same year 48 samples of milk were purchased from retail vendors, and were followed by 11 prosecutions, equal to 22.9 per cent. Therefore it was evident at that date that whereas the milk delivered by farmers at the railway stations only yielded 1.2 per cent. of prosecutions, the milk sold by retailers yielded 2.29 per cent., and that sampling milk at railway stations was no protection to the public. Dr. Harris, of Islington, carried the inquiry at railway stations further, and in his annual report for 1902 showed that whereas only 2 per cent of the samples of milk taken at railway stations were adulterated, 12 per cent of those taken elsewhere were found adulterated in 1902, and he said "it is clearly evident that the adulteration of our milk takes place not at the hands of the farmer, but at those of the wholesale and retail vendors." He further added, "milk purveyors in Islington, as elsewhere, are not satisfied with the Official Standard when contracting for their milk with the farmers. They require whole pure milk with all its fat, not 3 per cent., and woe betide the farmers who send such a low percentage of fat., Why, the former would at once break the contract, for they know full well that this percentage does not represent a farmer's genuine milk." It may be added, that it is usually only when the farmer finds his contract unprofitable that he adulterates his milk so as to diminish his loss, or induce the wholesale milk dealer to break his contract; but the latter has the power 92 in his hands cither to break the contract or to enrich the milk to the Official Standard, if he wishes to continue to the end of the half-yearly contract, whichever course will pay him best at the moment. It is, therefore, evident that milk purveyors can take care of themselves in their own defence, and it is inadvisable to spend the ratepayers' money in protecting trade interests, and not those of the small traders but only those of the great dealers. In fact 98 per cent. of the expenditure upon the promiscuous sampling and analysis of milk at railway stations produces no result, and the remaining 2 per cent. protects special trade interests and not the public. The conclusion St. Pancras came to in 1901, which is confirmed by the results in Islington in 1902, was that by purchasing samples of milk of retail vendors, the adulteration of milk can most effectually be controlled. Sampling Milk sold by Wholesale Dealers.—Wholesale dealers include all dealers who sell milk to other dealers and to retailers, and also those dealers who sell milk both by wholesale and in retail. Those who carry on the wholesale and the double system of trading no doubt are sufficiently strong commercially to demand warranties, but the smaller dealers who are retailers only are not, and do not obtain warranties. Consequently to sample milk upon delivery to a retailer is futile, unless he has a warranty and can produce it. No retailer has ever done so in my experience, because retailers are under the impression that it is not their business to ascertain what kind of milk they purchase, inasmuch as they are empowered by law to take it upon trust or "belief" (see Sec. 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875), and because wholesale dealers will not give retailers warranties, for good reasons that will be subsequently shown, and that without the production of a warranty no prosecution can proceed, and consequently retailers knowing this do not ask for samples of wholesale dealers' milk to be taken upon delivery to them (the retailers). Sampling Milk sold by Retail Vendors.—Although no actual figures are available to show the percentage of adulterated samples obtained from different classes of dealers in milk, except the farmer or producer and the retailer or ultimate vendor to the public, nevertheless the impression left upon the mind is that the smaller amount of milk sold the greater the probability of adulteration, so that, if milk dealers are roughly classified as those selling—(1) a gallon or two a day, (2) a churn or two a day, (3) several churns a day, and (4) a van load or more churns daily—it would appear that amongst the firstmentioned class adulteration is most frequent, whereas amongst the lastmentioned it is least seldom found. This distinctly indicates that attention should be directed in the first place towards controlling the milk distribution of the smallest retailers, and working backwards to the large dealers and the producers. Sec. 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, provides that if a defendant—for instance, a retailer who has been proved by a public analyst's certificate to have sold milk to an inspector or his agent not of the nature, substance and quality demanded of him,—proves (1) that he sold the milk in the same state as when he purchased it, (2) that he had no reason to believe that at the time when he sold it the milk was not of the nature, substance, and quality demanded of him, and (3) that he has a written warranty of the nature,, substance, and quality of the milk,—then he shall be discharged from the prosecution. 93 (1) The proof that the retailer sold the milk in the same state as when he purchased it is usually the evidence tendered by himself, or by his own agents, or by members of his own family, or by persons in his own employ, who received the milk on delivery and handled it, and who describe in detail under oath how and when the milk was handled from the time of delivery at the premises to the time of selling to the Inspector. Rebutting evidence to this cannot be produced by the Inspector. The usual course of events is that the milk is delivered at the premises in a metal receptacle, that this receptacle containing the milk is carried to some particular part of the premises and deposited there, that after being stirred to mix the cream the milk is usually transferred in part or in whole from the receptacle in which it was delivered to the receptacle in which it is intended to be sold, that this latter receptacle is usually stood upon the counter of the milk shop, and that that the milk is removed therefrom for sale by a dipper after stirring to mix the cream. The milk may be sold immediately after delivery or some hours may elapse, and the milk after delivery may only pass through one person's hands or may be handled by several persons. Whether or not a strict watch is kept to see that no person add water to it or takes cream from it is a matter of statement upon oath, which is practically impossible to refute. (2) The proof that the retailer had no reason to believe that at the time when he sold it the milk was not of the nature, substance and quality demanded of him is usually his statement upon oath. "Milk," when sold by retail to the public, is interpreted to mean pure whole milk. It the retailer, in addition to proving by the previous-mentioned evidence, (a) that he sold the milk in the same state as when it was delivered at his premises, also gives evidence upon oath (b) that he had no reason to believe that what he sold was not pure whole milk, he apparently is held to have discharged his responsibility for the quality of the milk that he sold to the public. The purchaser, that is, the Inspector representing the public, is bound to ascertain and prove the quality of the milk before he can take proceedings against the retail vendor, but the retail vendor is not bound to ascertain the quality of the milk ho buys or sells, he has merely to prove his belief that it is pure whole milk. This is the crux of the question. Surely the seller of an article ought to be held responsible for knowing what he is buying to sell to the public. So far as the watering and skimming of milk are concerned, there are rough and ready tests available, and sufficient to indicate these forms of sophistication, although not acceptable as exact evidence, but then, as soon as his suspicions are aroused, the retailer can call upon the Inspector to sample the milk upon delivery, at his premises, or to him (the retailor). The fact that such a request is never made by a retailer is sufficient to show how the anomalous condition of the law has relieved him of all sense of responsibility. The Board of Agriculture might with advantage be urged to inquire into the rapid and simple methods available for testing the quality of milk, especially as to the quantity of water and of butter fat, with the view to making a retailer responsible within limits under sec. 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, for the quality of the milk he purchases to sell to the public, and for not calling in the Inspector to sample the milk upon delivery from the wholesale dealer when the suspicion of the retailer ought to have been aroused, and for not having a written warranty. 94 Then, as the rough and ready tests available would reveal to the retailer the addition of water or abstraction of cream, or both, when above the limits below which Authorities do not usually prosecute and Magistrates do not usually convict, the present one-sided evidence of the milk being sold as it is purchased could be met by counter evidence, and the public be better protected against fraudulent retailers, and honest retailers against the secret practices of those about them. (3) The proof that a retailer has a written warranty of the nature, substance, and quality of the milk may be in the form of a contract, an invoice, or a label. If the retailer produce a written warranty, and also prove that he sold the milk as he received it (an extremely difficult thing to disprove), he is discharged from prosecution. The wholesale dealer can then be prosecuted, and, if the place of delivery be at the premises of the retailer, the wholesale dealer cannot escape from liability, even if his warranty be guarded by the words "without accepting any responsibility after delivery" (Wilson x. Playle, K.B.D., April 3, 1903, Knight's L.G.R., 1903, p. 870). Furthermore, the wholesale dealer cannot rely upon the warranty he has received from thefarmer who supplied him with this very milk, as the Acts do not provide for successive warranties for the same sample of milk (Manners v. Tyler, K.B.D., May 3rd, 1902, L R., p. 901). It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that wholesale dealers do not give warranties to retailers.

On the 21st September the Borough Council passed the following resolution— That communications be addressed to the Presidents of the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture requesting them to introduce a Bill into Parliament next Session to repeal the Warranty Sections of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875—1899. 96 Consecutive sampling.—Pending the repeal of the Warranty Sections of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, instructions were given to the Food Inspectors when sampling to always inquire whether a warranty in any form is held by the vendor, and, if there be a warranty, and the sample prove to be adulterated, to take a sample of the milk of the guarantor upon delivery at the vendor's premises. Unfortunately the second sample is not a sample of the inculpated milk, but it may in some measure be evidence of the bona or male fides of the guarantor.

The following are the Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors of Food and Food premises:— To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report on my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended 31st December, 1904. Milkshops.—I made 397 visits to milkshops, and with seven exceptions found the milk vessels generally satisfactory. During these visits I found 29 persons selling milk without being registered in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders; this is a decrease on the number of last year. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—I obtained 375 samples of milk, butter, and other articles for analysis by the Public Analyst, of which 65 articles were adulterated, and proceedings taken in 22 cases. This is an increase of 125 samples of previous years. Licensed Slaughter-houses.—I made 211 inspections of the eight private slaughter-houses in the divisions and saw 589 sheep, 78 pigs, 122 bullocks, 4 calves, and 27 lambs killed; and such organs as on examination were found to be diseased I had removed by consent of the owners under Sub-Sec. 8 of Sec. 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The following table shows the number of animals found to be diseased, nature of disease, &c.:— No. Description of Carcase. Disease. Where Affected. How disposed of. 1 Ox Tuberculosis Liver & Spleen Destroyed at the Dust Destructor 8 Oxen Flukes Livers „ „ 3 Oxen Abscess Livers „ „ 2 Oxen Echinococcus Veterinorum Lungs „ „ 1 Ox Echinococcus Veterinorum Liver „ „ 1 Ox Cirrhosis Liver „ „ 1 Sheep Abscess Lungs „ „ 1 Sheep Echinococcus Veterinorum Liver „ „ On several occasions I had to call the attention of the Licensee to breaches of the By-laws. Licensed Cowsheds.—There are now only five licensed cowsheds in the divisions, three having been closed during the year; the renewals of the licenses having been objected to by me, also by the London County Council Inspector. I paid 112 visits to the cowsheds and found them fairly satisfactory. 99 Marketing Places.—I made 1530 inspections of the various market places, including butchers, pork butchers, poulterers, fishmongers, greengrocers' shops, &c., and when necessary made applications to the Magistrates sitting at the Police Courts to condemn and order the destruction of certain unsound food. Food Makers.—There are 150 makers of sausages, ice cream, extract of meat, tripe, &c. I have made 162 visits, and have, with few exceptions, found the premises satisfactory, and the food sound. During the year I have attended the Police Courts 74 times in the discharge of my duties. I am, &c., H. R. Child, Inspector of Meat and other Foods. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for the year ending December 31st, 1904. Markets. The market streets, food shops, greengrocers, costers' barrows, stalls and fish shops have been inspected daily; 2,256 inspections of the market streets have been made, and the following articles have been destroyed, the same being unfit for human food:— Mackerel 125 Skate 135 Haddocks 120 Oysters 500 Lobsters 5224 tins Butchers Meat 138 lbs. Bacon 1344 „ Hams 336 ,, Livers 14 Rabbit 1 Bananas 25 Food Makers. I have made 334 inspections of places where food is manufactured, such aa sausages, &c., and have found the meat and other ingredients used sweet and sound, free from disease and the premises kept in a fairly clean condition. Slaughter-houses. During the year, 287 inspections of the slaughter-houses have been made by me. I have seen a number of animals slaughtered, all of which have been found free from disease and of good quality. Cow-sheds. There are five registered cow-sheds licensed to keep 102 cows. One hundred inspections have been made of these premises, and they have been found in a cleanly condition, the regulations complied with, and the animals in a healthy condition. 100 Milk Shops and Dairies. I have made 498 inspections during the year, and have not had occasion to report any infringement of the regulations, but I am of opinion there are many of the places where milk is sold that are unsuitable for the storage and sale of milk. Food and Drugs Acts. I have taken 375 samples of articles of food and submitted the same to the Public Analyst for analysis, for result see his report. Legal Proceedings. I have attended 51 times at the Police Courts in connection with my duties as Food Inspector, an increase of eight attendances over the year 1903. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, J. Osborne, Meat and Food Inspector. Canal Boats Act. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I have inspected 77 registered dwelling boats during the year, and reported one case of infringement of the bye-laws. A notice was served on the owner of the boat, and was complied with. There has also been one case of infectious disease, viz., Typhoid Fever. The patient was removed to the Asylums' Board Hospital, all the clothes and bedding removed to the Borough Council's Disinfecting Station, and the cabin fumigated before the boat was allowed to leave on its voyage up country. The majority of the boats are kept clean, in good sanitary condition, and in good repair. Yours obediently, J. Osborne, Inspector of Canal Boats. 101 VI.—LEGISLATION. § 1—GENERAL ACTS. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1904. (4 Edw. TIL, Ch. 16.) An Act to enable regulations to be made for carrying into effect conventions with respect to the prevention of danger arising to public health from vessels, and the prevention of the conveyance of infection by means of vessels. The essential part of this Act is Section 1 (1), as follows:— 1.—(1) The power of making regulations under the Public Health Act, 1896, and the enactments mentioned in that Act, shall include the power of making regulations authorising measures to be taken for the prevention of danger arising to public health from vessels arriving at any port, and for the prevention of the conveyance of infection by means of any vessel sailing from any port, so far as may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of carrying out any treaty, convention, arrangement, or engagement with any foreign country, and the regulations may in particular provide for the recovery of any expenses incurred in disinfection and of any charges authorised to be made by the regulations for the purpose of those regulations or any service performed thereunder, and also for any powers and duties under the regulations being executed and performed by local authorities: Provided that the regulations shall not be made except after consultation with the Board of Trade. § 2.—LOCAL ACTS. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Part IV—Sanitary. 19. (1) Where on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health of any Sanitary District it appears to the Sanitary Authority of that District that any articles in any house or part thereof in that district are in such a filthy dangerous or unwholesome condition that health is affected or endangered thereby, or that the cleansing or purifying or destroying of any such article is requisite to prevent risk of or to check infectious disease, the Sanitary Authority may cause such articles to be at their own expense cleansed or purified or they may destroy the same. (2) If any owner suffer any unnecessary damage the Sanitary Authority shall compensate him for the same, and the Sanitary Authority shall also compensate the owner for any article destroyed. 20. (I) Where on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health of any Sanitary District it appears to the Sanitary Authority of that district that any house or part thereof in that district is infested with vermin, such Sanitary Authority shall give notice in writing to the owner or occupier of such house or part thereof requiring him within a period to be specified in 102 such notice to cleanse such house or the portion thereof specified in the notice, and if so required in the notice to remove the wall paper from the walls of such house or the part thereof specified in the notice, and to take such other steps for the purpose of destroying and removing vermin as the case may require. (2) If the person to whom such notice is given fails to comply therewith within the time therein specified he shall be liable on summary com iction to a fine not exceeding, ten shillings for every day during which he makes default in complying with the requirements of such notice, and the Sanitary Authority may, if they think fit, at any time after the expiration of the period specified in the notice, themselves do any work required by the notice to be done, and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Sanitary Authority in so doing shall (subject as hereinafter provided) be recoverable summarily as a civil debt from the person making the default. (3) Upon any proceedings under this section the Court may inquire as to whether any requirement contained in any notice given or any work done by the Sanitary Authority was reasonable, and as to whether any costs and expenses incurred by the Sanitary Authority in doing such work or any part thereof ought to be borne wholly or in part by the person to whom the notice was given, and the Court may make such Order concerning such costs and expenses or their apportionment as appears to the Court to be just and equitable under the circumstances of the case. 21. Section 59 of "The Public Health (London) Act, 1891," shall, for the purposes of the two last preceding sections of this Act, extend and be applicable to the provision of means for cleansing, purifying and destroying filthy, dangerous or unwholesome articles, and for the removal thereof, and for the cleansing of houses infested with vermin, as if the said Section 59 were re-enacted herein and in terms made applicable thereto. 22. If any sanitary convenience now or hereafter erected in or accessible from any street in any Sanitary District shall be so placed or constructed as to be a nuisance or offensive to public decency the Sanitary Authority of that district, by notice in writing, may require the owner to remove such convenience or otherwise to reconstruct the same in such a manner and with such materials as may be required to abate the nuisance and remove the offence against public decency. Any owner who fails within a reasonable time to comply with a notice under this Section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of five pounds, and to a further fine not exceeding twenty shillings for every day during which he makes default in complying with the requirements of such notice after each conviction. 23. Where any person shall have provided in connection with any building in any Sanitary District a movable ashpit conforming with the requirements of any by-law or order made under any statutory power or authority in that behalf it shall be lawful for the Sanitary Authority of that district, by notice in writing, to require the owner of such building to remove or fill up any fixed ashpit in or about such building, and restore to a good and sanitary condition the site of such ashpit within a reasonable period to be prescribed in such notice, and if such owner fails to comply therewith within the period so prescribed, he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 103 twenty shillings, and to a further fine not exceeding ten shillings for every day during which he makes default in complying with such notice after such conviction. Provided that the Sanitary Authority may, if in tli9 circumstances of any particular case they think fit, bear any reasonable costs and expenses or part thereof incurred in executing work under this Section. 24. (1) If the Sanitary Authority of any Sanitary District have reasonable cause to suppose— (a) That any articles in any house or part thereof in that District are in such a condition as is described in the Section of this Act of which the marginal note is "Filthy, dangerous or unwholesome articles to "be purified"; or (b) That any house or part thereof in that District is infested with vermin such Sanitary Authority may enter on such house or part thereof and may inspect and examine the same and any articles therein for the purposes of the Sections of this Act of which the marginal notes are respectively" Filthy "dangerous or unwholesome articles to be purified," and "Houses infested "with vermin to be cleansed." (2) The Sanitary Authority of any Sanitary District shall have a right to enter at all reasonable times any house, building or premises or part thereof, in that District for the purpose of examining whether there is any contravention of the provisions of this Part of this Act or any non-compliance with the requirements of any notice given thereunder respectively. 25.

By-laws made by the London County Council under Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to water closets, earth closets, privies and receptacles for dung. (1) The occupier of any premises shall cause every water closet belonging to such premises to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as may be necessary for the purpose of keeping such water closets in a cleanly condition. The occupier of any premises shall once at least in every week cause every receptacle for dung belonging to such premises to be emptied and thoroughly cleansed.

Regulations for guidance in the construction of public urinals are under consideration. § 6.—LEGAL DECISIONS. (Before Wills and Kennedy, J.J., 19th January, 1904). Oliver v. Camberwell Borough Council. Metropolis—Public health—Nuisance—Intimation notice threatening proceedings—"Sewer" described therein as a "drain"—Recipient executing repairs to sewer—Right to recover cost of work from Sanitary Authority —Whether work done voluntarily or under compulsion—Builder fraudulently laying a sewer instead of authorised drain—Effect of—Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (54 & 55 Vict., cap. 76), ss 3, 4. An owner, who is served with an intimation of a nuisance under sec. 3 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requiring him to repair a "drain," and who thereupon complies, must be held to have done the work voluntarily, and not under compulsion, although the notice contains a threat that the authority will commence proceedings against him by the service of a statutory notice, if the repairs are not done within a week. Therefore, if the so-called "drain" proves to be a "sewer," he cannot recover from the authority the cost of the repairs. Query, what may be the respective rights and duties of an owner and an authority where a builder, authorised to lay a " drain " from a house, has, in fraud of the authority, joined it to the drain from another house, so as to constitute it a "sewer." J.P.R., 16.4, 1904. (Before Channell, J., without a Jury, March 18th, 19th, 1904.) Heaver and Others v. Mayor, etc., of Fulham. Local Government—Metropolis Management Act, 1855 (18 & 19 Vict., c. 120), ss. 76, 83, 101, 250—Drain or Sewer—Drainage of two houses by combined operation—Transfer of title otherwise than by purchase—Estoppel. A metropolitan vestry had approved a plan for the drainage of a number of houses which did not show the particular drainage of each house, but authorised the drainage of the houses in pairs by a series of combined operations. In a pair of such houses, the drainage was carried off by two pipes, laid one under each house; these pipes joined into one pipe before they reached the sewer. The pipe under house A took the whole of the drainage of A, together with that from a sink in the back part of house B; the pipe under B took the rest of the drainage of B. The connection between the sink in B and the pipe under A had been made at the time when the houses and the drains were constructed. The trustees of a settlement were owners of both houses; they derived their title, without any purchase for value, from the original owner, by whom the houses and drains were constructed. The Court inferred as a fact that the connection of the sink in house B with the pipe under A was made by the authority of the surveyor to the vestry. 108 Held, that the connection did not make the pipe under house A a sewer within the meaning of ss. 101 and 250 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. Held, further, that, even if the connection had been made without authority the present plaintiffs, not being purchasers for value, could get no higher rights than the original owner had as against the public; and the pipe would still remain a drain. A notice under ss. 83 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, had been served upon the plaintiffs by the defendants. Held, that it had been wrongly served (assuming that the connection had been wrongfully made), because the plaintiffs were not the persons who had made the connection originally. Silles v.
