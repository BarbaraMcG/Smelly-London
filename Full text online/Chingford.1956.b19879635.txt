ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1956 To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Chingford Corporation. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Report for the year 1956 upon the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough. The estimated population for the year was 46,840. Vital Statistics: The following vital statistics are worthy of record: the birth rate improved to 10.5 per thousand from the record low figure of 9.9 in 1955. The death rate was 8.3 per thousand, (7.2 in 1955). Of the total deaths, 392, cancer caused 78, and heart disease and associated vascular conditions caused 199, these two conditions amounting to more than 2 deaths out of every 3. The infant mortality rate, 10.1 per thousand live births, was the lowest yet recorded: the rate for England and Wales was 23.8. Infectious Diseases: Again I am glad to be able to report the absence of diphtheria. This is the sixth successive year without a single case. Apart from whooping cough, scarlet fever and dysentery, infectious fevers showed a marked decline. A single case of poliomyelitis occurred which was non-paralytic. Vaccination against this disease commenced in May. The vaccination of school children, in their 14th year, against tuberculosis, continued. A further step forward in the long campaign to improve the standard of food hygiene was the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, and the Pood Hygiene Regulations, 1955 and 1956. The Act came into force on 1st January, 1956. The Health Department undertook the administrative work involved in providing a Chiropody Service for Chingford residents of pensionable age under arrangements made through the Chingford Old People's Welfare Committee 2. Dr. F.G. Brown, Area Medical Officer, has kindly supplied the statistical matter on pages 6 and 7. Finally I express ray appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support, and to the staff of the Health Department for their excellent work during the year. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. H. CROSBY Medical Officer of Health. August, 1957. 3.

(h) Day Nurseries There is one Day Nursery in the district, situated at 136/138, Chingford Mount Road. Regular medical inspection of the children attending this Nursery was carried out during the year. (i) Home and Domestic Help Scheme There is a Home and Domestic Help Scheme in the Chingford district, under the auspices of the Essex County Council. Application for these facilities should be made to the Area Medical Officer, Municipal Offices, High Road, Woodford, E.18. (j) Chiropody Facilities A chiropody clinic for persons of pensionable age only is held on Thursday afternoons at the Essex County Health Services Clinic, Marmion Avenue, South Chingford. Appointments to attend this clinic must be made through the Area Medical Officer, Municipal Offices, High Road, Woodford, E.18. The Health Department undertook the administration of the scheme to provide chiropody for Chingford residents of pensionable age, sponsored by the Chingford Old People's Welfare Committee. This scheme commenced in September 1956 and the response has been overwhelming. At present two chiropodists practising in the borough provide treatment under the scheme. The waiting time between the date of application for treatment and the date treatment can be commenced is approximately sixteen weeks. 8. In addition to the foregoing facilities, five persons hold licences from the Essex County Council to carry on private practice as chiropodists within the borough. These premises are inspected annually. LOCAL CLINICS AND TREATMEMT CENTRES, 1957 Clinic Where held When held Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics Primary Hall, Buxton Road, North Chingford.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supplies. A hard, pure and constant piped water supply is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board; the supply has been satisfactory in both quality and quantity. Rivers and Streams. Forty seven visits were made during the year in connection with the pollution of water courses. Informal action secured the abatement of minor instances of pollution. Fly Nuisance. The emergence of flies from the waters of the Metropolitan Water Board Reservoirs was again experienced and for the year under review was a spring emergence in the vicinity of the William Girling Reservoir. Prompt action by the Water Board was again effective in providing at least temporary relief from the nuisance. Public Cleansing. A weekly collection of refuse and salvage was maintained and the total weight of refuse disposed of at the Works was 12,044 tons as compared with 11,797 tons for the previous year. The Registrar General's estimate of population at the mid-year 1956 indicated a further decline, being 46,840 as against the estimate for mid-year 1955 of 47,310. The number of premises from which refuse was collected showed an increase, being 14,378 as against 14,337 for the previous year. The analysis of income on page 14 reveals a total figure of £12,164 as against £11,908 for the previous year. Whilst the sale of waste paper made a major contribution to this figure, notable sums were also received from the sale of metals, both ferrous and nonferrous, cullet, bottles, jars and textiles. The net cost per ton for the collection of refuse was 30/-d as against 27/ld for the year ended March, 1956 and 25/3d for the year ended March, 1955. The increase in the unit cost per ton was due to Wage Awards, no additional men being employed during the year. Five refuse collection vehicles were in daily use, two vehicles maintained as spares. No new vehicles were acquired during the year. 11. The net cost per ton for the disposal of refuse was 6/l0d as compared with 4/8d in the previous year and 2/l0d for the year ended March, 1955. Although this cost is slightly higher then in the previous year, it is still reasonable in relation to the averages for the whole of the country. The net expenditure for the collection and disposal of refuse and salvage, including loan charges, was £22,193 or 36/l0d per ton as against £18,759 or 31/9d per ton for the previous year. The three 24-cell Morrison Electric Trucks used in connection with street cleansing, continue to function satisfactorily. They have been in continuous use now for four year and new batteries of 238 ampere/hours capacity each will be provided during the year 1957. The cost of these batteries is £192.14.0d. each and, like the ones previously installed, will be guaranteed for four years Item 1956/57 (Actual) 1957/58 (Estimated) Electricity £38 £45 Water and Oil 4 6 Cleaning Materials and Equipment 5 9 Repairs 50 60 Tyres 43 55 Maintenance Contract 17 30 Insurance and Licences 81 81 £238 £286 Road gullies were cleansed by contract as in the previous year, those gullies in main roads being cleansed four times per year and those in district roads twice per year. The public sanitary conveniences were maintained in good condition throughout the year, but wilful damage continued at the three conveniences which have not full-time attendants. 12. collection and disposal of house and trade refuse cost statement 1956/57 Item Particulars 1 Collection 2 Disposal 3 Totals 4 Percentage of total gross expenditure 5 REVENUE ACCOUNT £ £ £ % 1 Gross expenditure: (i) Labour 9991 8531 18522 54 (ii) Transport 7509 — 7509 22 (iii) Plant, equipment, land and buildings 38 4115 4153 12 (iv) Other items 963 3210 4173 12 (v) Total gross expenditure 18501 15856 34357 100 2 gross income 43 5 11729 12164 - 3 NET COST 18066 4127 22193 - 4 Capital expenditure met from revenue (included above) a _ 1017 1017 UNIT COSTS s. d. s. d. s. d. 5 Gross cost per ton, labour only 16. 7. 14. 2. 30. 9. 6 Gross cost per ton, transport only 12. 6. - - 12. 6. 7 Net cost (all expenditure) per ton 30. 0. 6. 10. 36. 10. £ £ £ 8 Net cost per 1,000 population 386 88 474 9 Net cost per 1,000 premises 1257 287 1544 13.

The Pool was opened on the 13th May and closed on the 9th September, 1956. The total attendance throughout the season was 87,598, the highest attendance being on the 26th July, 1956 when 5,689 persons were present. Samples of water were taken from the Pool during the months of June, July and August and the results in all cases were to the 22. effect that the water was of a high standard of bacterial purity, suitable for bathing purposes. Schools The general condition and supply of water to schools has been satisfactory during the year. Co-operation continued with the School Medical Officer and reports were forwarded to that Officer following quarterly visits paid to the canteens attached to all Schools, During the year continued progress was made in the execution of works of repair and maintenance. Offensive Trades. Within the meaning of the Public Health Act there are no offensive trade premises in the district but there are eight fish fryers. The number of visits made to fish shops was 104. Bakehouses. Forty visits were paid to the eight bakehouses in the district and generally they were maintained in a satisfactory condition. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. A full time Rodent Operative is employed for rodent infestation work and whilst there was no evidence of major infestations in the town, 1199 visits were paid to deal with minor infestations at private and business premises and in connection with sewer maintenance. The fifteenth and sixteenth maintenance treatments were carried out in March and September respectively. In March 206 manholes were baited and of these 55 showed complete or partial takes; 290 manholes were baited in September, 39 of which showed complete or partial takes. 23.

SECTION D. HOUSING HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954. Certificates of Disrepair. One application for a Certificate was received and was granted. One Certificate was revoked. Improvement Grants. Eight applications for Improvement Grants were received and four were granted. Sub-Standard Properties. In the previous report for the year 1955, mention was made of the two reports prepared by the Chief Public Health Inspector on these properties and in connection with one block of property in the northern area, arrangements were made with the owners for the carrying out of a considerable amount of work without recourse to the service of formal notices. Unfortunately the owners were not able to consider the provision of improvements in relation to bathrooms, hot water systems, etc. Five-Year Programme. The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 required Local Authorities to submit proposals for dealing with unfit houses and the number of such houses to be dealt with in this area within the five-year period was fifteen. Of that number, seven were demolished during the period under review and, where necessary, the tenants rehoused by the Corporation, and in two instances Closing Orders were made. HOUSING STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1956. 1. Number of Houses Erected during the year:- (1) By the L.A. (permanent) Traditional (including flats) 59 (2) By private enterprise (including flats) 53 112 2.

SECTION E. INSPECTION AMD SUPERVISION OF FOOD Milk Supply The milk supply is from several large firms with dairy premises outside the Borough boundaries and mainly pasteurised. Thirteen samples of milk were analysed during the year and all were certified to be genuine. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949. Graded Milks- The following table shows the licences granted during the year for the sale of milk under the special designations, as provided by the above Regulations 5 dealers' licences to sell milk as Pasteurised. 12 " " " " " " Sterilised. 3 supplementary licences to sell milk as Pasteurised, 3 " " " " " " Sterilised. 5 dealers' licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested. 2 supplementary licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested. 1 " " " " " " " (Pasteurised). Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Food and Drugs Authority. The Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district and during the year samples approximating in number to two per thousand of the population were taken and submitted to the joint Public Analysts. Public Analyst. Mr. George Taylor, F.R.I.C., 20 Eastcheap, London. E.C.3. and Dr. J.H. Hamence , F.R.I.C., 20 Eastcheap, London, E.C.3. continued as Joint Public Analysts for the area. Samples submitted for Analysis. 104 samples of food and drugs were submitted for analysis, 54 formal and 50 informal and it will be seen by the following table that a reasonably wide field was covered. The table shows that nine samples were reported upon adversely. 27. Of the nine samples referred to in the previous paragraph, six related to bread rolls or bread slices and in one instance (3 samples) proceedings were instituted against the manufacturers for selling food with a label which was calculated to mislead as to the quality of the food. Proceedings were not instituted in the second instance (3 samples) where it was deemed that the label was not misleading, although there was a difference between the analysis stated thereon and that disclosed by the Public Analyst,, The continued introduction of foods which are claimed to have a dietetic value require close observation. Not infrequently the manufacturers go to the trouble of printing on the label a precise analysis (although there would appear to be no obligation to do this) but experience has shown that this analysis is not strictly adhered to in the product. Two samples of Siam Patna Rice were submitted for analysis from a school canteen on account of taint. The analysts were unable to find any reason for this and bacteriological examination for organisms, such as would be associated with faecal matter, yielded negative results. The stock of rice was returned to the suppliers. A sample of Dried Milk Powder was also submitted for analysis from a school canteen because of the presence of burnt specks in the substance thereof. These were identified as burnt or charred milk powder. 28. Samples taken during the year 1956.

SECTION F PREVENTION AMD CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Diphtheria For six years in succession no case of diphtheria has been notified to the Health Department. The following is a statement of the number of children immunised during the year:- Primary immunisations -under 5 years- 402 " " -5 to 15 years- 7 Total- 409 Number receiving secondary or reinforcing injections- 150 Scarlet Fever Although the total of 66 cases of scarlet fever was double that for 1955, all of them were of a mild character and responded rapidly to treatment. The following table indicates the cases notified during the past five years and the percentage of cases removed to hospital:- l952 1953 1954 1955 1956 Confirmed cases 181 168 64 33 65 Percent-age removed to hospital 47 37 17 27 26 Measles The incidence of measles in the borough was very slight, only 59 cases being notified. None of them needed admission to hospital. Convalescent serum was available from the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale for the treatment of cases and the protection of contacts. Whooping Cough This disease was the most prevalent of the infectious diseases, with a total of 249 notifications. One child, aged 3 months, died from this cause, the first death that has occurred from whooping cough in the borough for several years. 386 children received a full course of immunisation against this condition during the year. 36. Acute Poliomyelitis Chingford was most fortunate in not having more than one case of poliomyelitis, this being non-paralytic. Vaccination against this disease commenced in May 1956. Tuberculosis Twenty crises of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified to the Health Department in 1956, a figure similar to that for 1955, but well below the average, 36, notified for the years 1950-54. The scheme for vaccination of school children in their fourteenth year, with B.C.G. vaccine, against tuberculosis was continued, a total of 325 children being vaccinated out of 584 who were eligible. The Walthamstow and Chingford Association of Tuberculosis Care Helpers gave material assistance in the way of milk, groceries, clothing, etc. to the families of tuberculous persons who were in need of such support. Dysentery A total of 23 persons were notified to the department as suffering from dysentery. In addition to the individual cases notified, an outbreak of dysentery occurred in a school in the borough. Prompt measures were instituted to limit the infection: in all about 50 children were involved. The prevalence of this disease indicates that there has been a serious lapse on somebody's part in the matter of personal hygiene: it cannot be too strongly stressed that this condition would be brought under control if hands were washed after every visit to the lavatory and before preparing or eating food. Food Poisoning The four cases of food poisoning which occurred were all investigated, but in only two of them was the causal agent identified. Food Hygiene A close liaison was maintained between the Health Department and all food premises in the borough. Vaccination During the year 309 persons received primary vaccination and 178 persons were re-vaccinated. 37. National Assistance Act, 1948. (a) Section 47: Care of Aged and Chronic Sick. For the first time since the Act came into force, statutory action was taken to detain in suitable accommodation a person who was aged and living in very insanitary conditions. Following the initial court order for detention up to a period of three months, no further court proceedings became necessary as the person concerned agreed voluntarily to remain permanently in the accommodation provided. Hospital accommodation, or accommodation in hostels for the aged, was arranged for several aged and infirm persons. In a few other instances the provision of a home help obviated the need for hospital care. (b) Section 50: In one case action was required under this section, which requires the local authority to arrange for the burial of persons for whom no arrangements have or are being made. Medical Examinations During the year 130 examinations were carried out by me in respect of Chingford Council staff and 55 in respect of staff of the Essex County Council.
