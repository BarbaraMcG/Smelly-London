Q 274 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH OF THE PARISH OF HAMMERSMITH. For the year 1896. Public Health Department, Temporary Offices, 57, Fulham Palace Road. 25th March, 1897. Gentlemen,—I beg to present to you my Annual Report for last year. The Report will deal with the vital statistics, and with the Sanitary work carried out under the direction of your Vestry during the 53 weeks ending on January 2nd, 1897. BIRTHS. During last year 3,007 births were registered in this Parish, against 2,909 in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, the number of births registered last year was 116 below the average number registered during the last 10 years. On the population estimated up to the middle of the year, i.e., 104,547 inhabitants, the number of births registered during the year was equal to the annual rate of 28.8 per 1,000 persons living. The birth-rate in London during the last year on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year i.e., 4,421,955 inhabitants was equal to an annual rate of 30.2 births per 1,000 persons living. DEATHS. During last year, 1,556 deaths were registered in this Parish, against 1,611 deaths in the previous year. Making due allowance for the increase of the population, 275 the number of deaths registered in this Parish last year was 185 below the average number registered during the last 10 years. Adding 331 deaths of parishioners of this Parish which took place in the general hospitals and other public institutions in other parishes of London, in London County Lunatic Asylums and Metropolitan Imbecile Asylums, and deducting 129 deaths of non-parishioners which occurred 87 at the West London Hospital, 24 at Nazareth House, 6 at the Convent of the Good Shepherd, 1 at St. Joseph's Schools, 9 at H.M. Prison, Wormwood Scrubs, and 2 which otherwise occurred in the Parish, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners which were registered last year was 1,758. On the before mentioned estimated population, the corrected number of deaths of parishioners registered last year was equal to an annual rate of 16.8 deaths per 1,000 persons living; the death rate in London on the estimated population of London up to the middle of the year was equal to an annual rate of 18.6 per 1,000 persons living. DEATHS OF INFANTS. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners under one year of age registered during last year was 517, against 469 in the previous year. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered last year was equal to 29.3 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and was equal to 17.2 per cent. of the total registered births. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age in London last year was equal to 26.2 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and to 16.1 per cent. of the total registered births. The mortality rate of infants under one year of age was therefore, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered, 3.1 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London, and, as compared with the total births registered, 1.1 per cent. more in this Parish than in London. DEATHS OF AGED PERSONS. The corrected number of deaths of parishioners at 60 years of age and upwards that were registered during last year was 426, against 477 in the previous year. The 276 number of deaths last year was equal to 0.41 per cent. of the total persons living, and to 24.2 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered. The percentage of deaths of persons registered at 60 years of age and upwards in London last year was equal to 0.42 per cent. of the total persons living, and 22.0 per cent. of the total deaths in London registered. This death rate was, therefore, 0.01 per cent. less in this Parish than in London as compared with the total inhabitants living, and 2.2 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London as compared with the total deaths. These figures indicate a favourable condition of Public Health in this Parish. TABLE I.

Note 1. Medical Officers of Health of "Combined Districts" must make a separate Return for the District of each Sanitary Authority. 2. Medical Officers of Health acting for a portion only of the District of a Sanitary Authority should write, in, the heading of the Table, the designation of the Division for which they act. 3. The words "Urban," "Rural," or "Metropolitan" must be inserted in appropriate space in the heading, according as the Sanitary Authority for the District is Urban or Rural, or is within the Metropolitan Area. 4. The "Localities" adopted for the purpose of these statistics should be areas of known population; such as parishes, groups of parishes, townships, or wards. As stated at the head of the first column in each table, Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the deaths in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses, Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 5. The deaths which have to be classified in this Table (A) and summed up in the horizontal line of "Totals," are the whole of those registered as having actually occurred in the several localities comprised within the Division or District. But the registered number of deaths frequently requires correction before it can give an exact view of the mortality of a Division or District; and the two lowest horizontal lines are provided for the purpose of enabling Medical Officers of Health to indicate, to the best of their ability, what the extent of such corrections should be. Details concerning the corrective figures, e.g., the institutions that have been considered, or the particular localities to which the corrections apply, may appear in the text of the report or in supplementary tables.

COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. March 25th, 1897. 279 DEATHS FROM THE 9 PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths of parishioners that were registered from the nine principal zymotic diseases last year was 331 against 250 in the previous year. The deaths of parishioners last year from these diseases were equal to 18.8 per cent. of the total deaths of parishioners registered, and were at the rate of 0.32 deaths per 100 persons living. The deaths from the 9 principal zymotic diseases in the whole of London were equal to 16.9 per cent. of the total deaths registered, and were at the rate of 0.32 deaths per 100 persons living. These deaths were, therefore, as compared with the total deaths of parishioners registered 1.9 per cent. greater in this Parish than in London, but as compared with the population the same in this Parish as in London. TABLE III. The following table shows the deaths of parishioners registered from the 9 principal zymotic diseases which occurred in the years 1887 to 1896. Year. Smallpox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. Whooping Cough. Typhus Fever. Enteric Fever. Simple Continued Fever. Diarrhœa and Cholera.

There were 933 cases of illness reported as due to notifiable infectious diseases in this Parish during last year, against 745 in the previous year. There were also 140 cases of illness that were not notifiable under the Act, 280 reported as due to infectious diseases, against 74 in the previous year. SMALL-POX. One case was reported as due to small-pox last year, against 7 cases in the previous year. The case reported last year was removed by the Highgate Hospital authorities to the Highgate Hospital at the request of the relatives of the patient, and the patient subsequently recovered. He had been vaccinated in infancy but had not been re-vaccinated. A special report dealing minutely with the particulars of the case was prepared by myself and presented to your Public Health Committee, and a copy of the same was forwarded to the Local Government Board and the London County Council. CHICKEN-POX. Five cases of chicken-pox was reported last year, against 2 cases in the previous year. One of the cases reported last year, notified as small-pox, was removed to a small pox hospital, but was returned the same day, as the diagnosis was not confirmed. The other 4 cases were treated at the homes of the patients. No death occurred MEASLES. Seventy-four cases were reported as due to measles, against 30 cases in the previous year. Fifty-eight cases were not reported until after death. Ten cases were not reported until after recovery; and in 6 cases at the time when the disease was reported the patients were still suffering from the complaint. Sixty-eight cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients, and 6 at the Fulham Union Infirmary. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as, no doubt, a very small proportion of the cases which occurred were reported to me. 281 SCARLET FEVER. Five hundred and twenty-eight cases were reported as due to scarlet fever, against 382 cases in the previous year. Two hundred and eighty-five cases reported last year were isolated at Isolation Hospitals, 274 at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Western Fever Hospital, 10 at the London Fever Hospital at Islington, 242 at the homes of the patients, and 2 at St. George's Hospital. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 3.78 per cent. DIPHTHERIA AND DIPHTHERITIC MEMBRANOUS CROUP. Two hundred and seventeen cases were reported as due to diphtheria and diphtheritic membranous croup, against 202 cases in the previous year. Seventy-six cases reported last year were treated in the Isolation Hospitals, 73 at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Western Fever Hospital, and 3 at the London Fever Hospital. Ten cases were treated at the West London Hospital, 2 at the Hospital for Sick Children, 1 at St. George's Hospital, and 128 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the total cases reported in the parish was 23.51 per cent. WHOOPING COUGH. Sixty-one cases were reported last year as due to whooping cough, against 42 cases in the previous year. Sixty of the cases reported last year were treated at home, and were not reported until after death, and 1 case was not reported until after recovery. As this is not a notifiable disease it is of no use my giving the mortality rate on the cases reported, as, doubtless, a very large number of cases occurred which recovered and were not known of in your Public Health Department. ENTERIC FEVER. Fifty-three cases were reported last year as due to enteric fever, against 57 in the previous year. Ten of the cases reported last year were treated at the Western Fever 282 Isolation Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, 4 at the West London Hospital, 1 at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 1 at the Children's Hospital, 1 at King's College Hospital, 1 at the Fulham Union Infirmary, and 35 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported in the parish was 26.42 per cent. TYPHUS FEVER. One case was reported as due to typhus fever last year, against no case in the previous year. The case reported as typhus fever last year was not reported till after death. SIMPLE CONTINUED FEVER. Four cases were reported last year as due to simple continued fever, against 5 cases in the previous year. All of the cases reported last year were treated at the homes of the patients. One death occurred. The mortality on. the cases reported was 25.0 per cent. RELAPSING FEVER. No case was reported as due to relapsing fever last year, against no case in the previous year. PUERPERAL FEVER. Eight cases were reported as due to puerperal fever last year, against 3 cases in the previous year. One of the cases reported last year was treated at the West London Hospital, and 7 at the homes of the patients. The mortality on the cases reported was 37.50 per cent. CHOLERA. No case was reported as due to cholera last year against no case in the previous year. ERYSIPELAS. One hundred and twenty-one cases were reported last year as due to erysipelas, against 89 cases in the previous year. Of the 121 cases reported last year 11 were treated at the Fulham Union Infirmary, 1 at the West London Hospital, 1 at the Lock Hospital, and 108 at the homes of the patients. The mortality rate on the cases reported was 2.48 per cent. 283 TABLE IV. The following shows the number of cases that were reported as due to the undermentioned 13 zymotic diseases during the years 1888 to 1896. Year. Smallpox. Scarlet Fever.

TABLE V. The following Table marked (B) has been prepared by me under an instruction of the Local Government Board. NOTES ON TABLE B. (See also Notes on back of Table A.) Note 1. The present Table B is concerned with population, births, and sickness (not with mortality) in the Sanitary district or division to which the table relates. 1. As stated in the heading of Col. (a), Public Institutions should be regarded as separate localities, and the new cases of sickness in them should be separately recorded. Workhouses. Hospitals, Infirmaries, Asylums, and other establishments into which numbers of people, and especially of sick people, are received, are Public Institutions for the purpose of these statistics. 3. Comments on any unequal incidence of notifiable disease upon the several localities, and considerations as to the local incidence of consumption and other prevalent diseases, should be made in the text of the Report.

During last year 5 deaths were registered as due to influenza, against 52 deaths in the previous year. No official action was taken in reference to this complaint. LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The whole of the 16 licensed slaughter houses in the Parish were under regular fortnightly inspection by the four District Inspectors during last year. At the annual inspection of slaughter houses in October, 1895, I found that 16 licenses were to be applied for, and that they were all in a satisfactory condition. At the Special Sessions at the London County Council, held on 23rd October, the whole of the 16 licenses were granted without opposition by your Vestry.

The two licensed cow-houses in the Parish were under regular fortnightly inspection by the several Sanitary Inspectors during last year. At the annual inspection in October, the premises were found in a satisfactory condition, and at the Special Sessions of the London County Council, held on 2nd October, they were both renewed without opposition by your Vestry.

The whole of the bakehouses (61) in the Parish were under a regular quarterly inspection by the 4 district Sanitary Inspectors or by the Factory inspector during last year, In 6 instances it was reported that the premises were not in a proper sanitary condition. Notices were at once served upon the bakers calling upon them to comply with the regulations of your Vestry. In each instance the notice was complied with.

SEIZURE OF UNWHOLESOME FOOD. No articles of food were found to be in such a state as to be unfit for the food of man so as to justify seizure under 54 & 55 Vic., chap. 76, sec. 47. The heavy 289 ties obtained some years ago have no doubt had a salutary effect in preventing food being offered for sale in such a state as to justify seizure. SANITARY NOTICES AND ADMINISTRATION. During last year 3,119 notices were reported as having been served by your Sanitary Inspectors, having for their object the removal or prevention of nuisances or insanitary conditions, against 3,229 in the previous year, and during last year 3,216 notices were reported as having been complied with, against 3,630 in the previous year. The wise course adopted by your Vestry in appointing a House-to-House Inspector has been continued during the year. This Inspector reports that during the year he has inspected 4,092 houses and other premises in the parish. Altogether, since his appointment on January 20th, 1893, he reports that he has inspected 13,934 out of a total of about 16,500 inhabited houses in the parish. The defects in premises discovered as the result of his inspection are dealt with by the four District Sanitary Inspectors. During last year your Vestry in consequence of the extra duties imposed upon your Public Health Department under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1894, decided to appoint a special Inspector for the supervision of Factories and Workshops, and since his appointment on the 24th June, 1896, 196 notices have been served by this Inspector. I felt it my duty to advise you to appoint a special officer for these duties, as I was clearly of opinion that without a special officer the duties under the Acts could not be efficiently carried out. SUMMONSES ORDERED. During last year your Vestry and the Public Health Committee gave authority for 21 summonses to be taken out against persons for having failed to comply with the requirements of your Vestry or the Public Health Committee. Before any summonses were taken out a letter R 290 was written to the person in default, informing him that the Vestry or Public Health Committee had ordered the summons, and asking him if he were willing to give an undertaking in writing that he would forthwith comply with the notice which had been served. In most instances the undertaking was at once given, and it was not found to be necessary to apply for a summons. It has been the object of the Department to take out as few summonses as possible, but at the same time in no single instance to allow anyone to defy the authority of your Vestry. SUMMONSES TAKEN OUT. During last year only 7 summonses were taken out through the Public Health Department. The following is a list of the premises in reference to which summonses were issued, with a statement as to the nature of the complaint and the result of the proceedings. TABLE VI.

During last year your Vestry removed 6 dead bodies of persons who had died from infectious diseases, and 2 bodies of persons for whom no proper accommodation could be found at the late residences of the deceased, to the mortuary at the Wharf, Chancellors, There were 135 bodies brought to the mortuary by order of the Coroner or the Police, 30 of these were taken from the West London Hospital, and included 10 parishioners and 20 non-parishioners. PUBLIC NUISANCES. During last year I brought before your Public Health Committee complaints received by me in reference to the following alleged public nuisances:— I. Nuisance from fumes from a shaft at the Brook Green Carpet Cleaning Works. II. Offensive odour from brickfield at the end of Ormiston Road, Shepherd's Bush. III. Nuisance from gullies in the neighbourhood of Raynham Road. IV. Offensive effluvia from roof of the retort house of the Great Western Gas Works, College Park. V. Offensive odour caused by a product of the compression of a mineral oil discharge into the main sewer at, near to College Park. The whole of these complaints were reported upon by me, and had the careful consideration of your Committee. PROSECUTION OF BRICKMAKERS IN WOOD LANE. The process of brickmaking has been extensively carried on at Mr. A. Bird's brickfield, Wood Lane, and no nuisance has been ascertained to exist nor has any complaint been received through the year, 292 METEOROLOGY. The average mean temperature registered in London during last year was 50°.1 Fahrenheit. The highest temperature registered was 9l°.l in July. The lowest temperature was 24°.3 in February. Rain fell on 161 days. The total amount of rainfall was 2272 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. The Vestry of the parish of Hammersmith.
