WAN 76 Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1939, by F. G. CALEY, M.A., M.B, B.C., D.P.H., together with the Report of the Public Analysts. Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1939, by F. G. CALEY, M.A., M.B., B.C., D.P.H., together with the Report of the Public Analysts. REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1939. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present a short Annual Report on the Health and Health Services of the Borough for the year 1939 with a summary of the Report of the Public Analysts. These are drawn up in accordance with the instructions of the Minister of Health, contained in Circular 2067, dated 19th July, 1940, to the effect that, for the year 1939, Annual Reports should be interim ones only and should be confined to essential and urgent matters, including any changes in administration which have become necessary as a result of the war. The complete statistics for the year have been compiled so that the continuity of the annual records relating to the health of the Borough and the Health Services will be preserved. They are available for reference and publication when required. The health of the Borough during the year has been good. There has been a fall in the incidence of the common infectious diseases, probably due to the evacuation of a large number of children and the closure of the elementary schools on the outbreak of war. At the end of August a large Civil Defence personnel over 1,000 strong had to be quickly absorbed into the Department and organised into units, and to enable this to be carried out successfully many members of the staff of the Department were called upon to give their assistance in coping with the new problems 4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1939. which arose. It was inevitable, until the new services became organised on a proper basis, that for a short period there was some interruption in the ordinary peace-time duties of the officers concerned. Much of this, however, was offset by the effects of the outbreak of war on the routine health services of the Borough. The calls for the services of the Sanitary Inspectors fell away at once, as there was an immediate and material reduction in the number of complaints received from householders and much of the work in connection with housing ceased at once. Owing to evacuation and the closure of the schools the services of the Health Visitors were required less frequently for home visiting and for attending clinics. Although these adjustments were made, due to the circumstances mentioned, all the routine Health Services of the Department were in operation throughout the year, in spite of the war, and everything that had to be done was done. The Civil Defence duties for which the Health Department became responsible on the outbreak of war up to the end of 1939 were as follows:— 1. The continuation of the individual training of all persons who had enrolled for service in any of the Civil Defence Services administered by the Borough Council. The Department had been responsible for the training of all personnel since early in 1938, but many untrained members requiring training were enrolled on mobilisation. 2. The formation and detailed organisation of five Stretcher Party Stations, having an establishment of 1,130 men and arranging for the individual and team training of the men as they were engaged. 3. The formation and detailed organisation of eight First Aid Posts and five Mobile Units and training the personnel of over 300 persons. 4. The detailed arrangements for controlling the First Aid Services and the collection and transport of the dead during air raids for which I am responsible For this purpose a duty rota consisting of either myself or one of the other Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1939. 5 three Medical Officers of the Council and other responsible officers of the Department has been arranged, so that one medical and two other officers of the Department are available for duty in the Borough Control Room, throughout the 24 hours, to take charge of these services. 5. The collection of Civilian War Dead and the arrangements for transporting them to the temporary mortuaries. 6. The organisation and administration of the Gas Identification Service. 7. The training in first aid and anti-gas of the personnel of business firms. 8. The supervision of the food supplies, under war time conditions, by the Food Inspectors. 9. The local arrangements for the evacuation of children and expectant mothers in co-operation with the London County Council. 10. The medical inspection of war refugees. Even before September, 1939, certain members of the staff of the Department, especially those engaged in the training of persons who had enrolled for duty in the Civil Defence Services, had done much valuable work, much of it in their own time, towards helping with the organisation of these Services. When war broke out the whole of the staff were called upon to shoulder additional duties and responsibilities. The establishment of the First Aid Services, the setting up of duty rotas and the continuance of a large amount of training for untrained members of the new Services have necessitated additional work for all members of the staff, under conditions which are new, unfamiliar, even uncomfortable, and often involving considerable periods of overtime. I cannot speak too highly of the unselfish manner in which the whole of the staff have shouldered these additional and unfamiliar duties, with a devotion to duty which has been a credit to all concerned. F. G. CALEY, Medical Officer of Health. 6 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE BOROUGH.

The Registrar-General's estimated population for 1939 is 339,000 and it is on this rate that the birth-rates are calculated. The census population in 1931 was 353,110. Allowing for adjustments due to the war the average population for the year on which death rates are calculated is 321,000. The birth-rate for the year was 11.99 as against 11.92 in 1938. The standardised death rate was 10.92, compared with 10.38 for 1938. The infantile mortality was 47, one point higher than last year, which is the lowest mortality rate recorded. 8 STAFF—alterations during the year. On the outbreak of war Dr. Trott, Assistant Medical Officer of Health and Assistant Tuberculosis Officer, was seconded as First Aid Commandant and Dr. Dodd was appointed to perform Dr. Trott's duties under the Tuberculosis Scheme, on a sessional basis. Mr. E. J. Newton took up duty as a Sanitary Inspector in August following the resignation of Mr. H. F. Leacock. In order to cope with the additional duties devolving on the Department, mainly in connection with Civil Defence, it has been necessary to appoint additional temporary staff. At the end of the year the temporary staff consisted of 21 clerks, one Assistant to the Food Inspectors and an Assistant Store-keeper. Messrs. Rees, Hollis and Webb, Grade "A" Clerks, and Mr. Coomber, the Assistant to the Food Inspectors, have joined the Forces. The Training of Civil Defence Personnel. The duty of training all Civil Defence volunteers had been carried out by the Department for over a year before the outbreak of war and has been continued since. The personnel engaged in training duties were nine officers of the Council who have qualified as Government Instructors, and 18 locally trained Instructors. A large number of volunteers have undergone training and up to the end of the year 437 courses of lectures in Anti-gas and 144 courses of instruction in First Aid had been given. 9 INFECTIOUS DISEASES. There has been a reduction in the incidence and fatality of some of the infectious diseases. The number of cases of diphtheria has fallen from 479 in 1938 to 249 and the deaths from 15 to two. There were no deaths from measles, but the number of cases of whooping cough has increased from 508 in 1938 to 1,599 in 1939, and the deaths from three to 12 The number of cases of dysentery has fallen from 179 to seven; puerperal infections from 57 to 38 and tuberculosis from 621 to 535. The number of notifications of ophthalmia neonatorum has risen from 21 to 32. The deaths from cancer during the year were 575 as against 604 in 1938. Immunisation against Diphtheria. The two Immunisation Clinics have been open continuously throughout the year, and 693 persons have attended. The solution now used for routine immunisation is Alum Precipitated Toxoid (A.P.T.), two injections being given. For persons over 15 two injections of Toxoid Anti-toxin Floccules (T.A.F.) are given. The Clinics have been open for 12 years and during that time 6,723 persons have been protected as shown by a negative reaction to the re-Schick Test. The addresses, days and times of the Clinics are:— Municipal Buildings, Fairfield Street, Wandsworth. Wednesdays, 2 to 3.30 p.m. 91, Bedford Hill, Balham. Fridays, 2 to 3.30 p.m. 10 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1939.

The District Nurses made 8,548 visits on behalf of the Council to 231 cases of infectious disease and 543 children suffering from minor ailments. Special Treatment. Five persons are receiving insulin treatment for diabetes at the Council's expense and one person suffering from pernicious anaemia is being supplied with Neo hepatex. The cost of this service during the year was £13 15s. 2d. Inquests. Inquests were held during the year on 325 persons who died in the Borough and 187 Borough residents who died elsewhere— a total of 512 inquests. In 310 of these a verdict of death from natural causes was returned; in 140 death was accidental; 35 were suicides; 15 resulted from war wounds; six were returned as "found drowned"; there were five executions and one case of murder. 11 TUBERCULOSIS. 535 new cases of Tuberculosis were reported and 221 deaths were certified as due to this disease. The number of new cases is the lowest recorded since notification became general and the number of deaths is the lowest ever recorded. Twenty of the deaths had not been notified prior to death. The number of cases remaining on the Notification Register at the end of the year was 2,195. Tuberculosis Dispensaries. The days and times of the sessions held at the two Tuberculosis Dispensaries are as under:— (a) At the Main Dispensary, Municipal Buildings, Fairfield Street, Wandsworth, which serves the areas Putney, Southfield, Fairfield, Springfield and North Clapham:— Monday: Morning and afternoon.

Of the 1,377 new cases 304 were examined as contacts and 16 of these were found to be suffering from the disease. There were 1,395 cases of Tuberculosis and 96 suspected cases remaining on the Dispensary Register at the end of the year. 12 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1939. The total attendances at the Dispensaries was 4,463, the number of consultations with Medical Practitioners was 2,309 and the number of attendances at hospital for special treatment was 2,798.

This service has been maintained throughout the year although certain adjustments had to be made on the outbreak of war when many mothers and children were evacuated out of London. For about the first three months of the war the Health Visitors were called upon to assist with the details of the organisation of the First Aid Posts and Mobile Units and did valuable work in this connection. They were able, however, to continue their Maternity and Child Welfare duties, as there were fewer mothers and children needing supervision owing to evacuation. Of the 4,066 births which occurred during the year, 3,318 or 81.6 per cent. were visited and over 16,000 re-visits were made to children under five years of age. 3,882 visits were made to ante-natal cases and the total number of home visits and re-visits made by the 14 Health Visitors was 35,667. In addition to the home visiting, these officers made 2,241 attendances at clinics. Infant Welfare and Ante-natal Clinics.

Putney Park Centre was closed Maternity and Child Welfare. 15 in August, as it was felt that, owing to a continuing falling off in the attendances, a centre in this neighbourhood was no longer required. Children from this district now attend the Centre at Putney. The Centres at Blegborough Road in Streatham and Fairlight Hall in Tooting were closed on the outbreak of war as they were no longer required owing to the evacuation of many children out of London. Fairlight Hall was taken over as a First Aid Post. 915 sessions were held at the Centres during the year and 3,317 new cases were examined. The total attendances were 61,649, the number of doctors' consultations being 17,970. Ante-natal Clinics. 373 sessions were held at the nine clinics and 1,473 new cases attended, the total attendances being 5,198. 283 post-natal cases were examined at these clinics and at the post-natal clinic at the Maternity Home.

They were open for the first eight months of the year and during this period the number of attendances was 9,623. Borough of Wandsworth Babies' Hospital (Streatham). This Hospital was closed on the outbreak of war. Grants totalling £47 7s. 1d. were paid to the Southwark Diocesan Association towards the maintenance of nine unmarried mothers who were Borough residents in the institutions of the Association. Child Life Protection. There were 172 foster-mothers registered at the end of the year, compared with 198 at the end of 1938, but the number of foster-children was only 40, compared with 301. Convalescent Treatment. Seven mothers and 37 children were granted assistance with convalescent treatment at a cost of £125 10s. 0d. Wandsworth and Tooting Children's Clinic. This clinic was closed on the outbreak of war. Supply of Milk. 124 nursing and expectant mothers and 482 children were supplied with milk at a cost to the Council of £2,646 15s. 3d. Dental Treatment. In 1938 the Council decided to open a Dental Clinic at the Municipal Buildings for the treatment of expectant and nursing mothers, children under five years of age and persons suffering from Tuberculosis. Maternity and Child Welfare. 17 Mr. G. Tester Thompson, L.D.S., was appointed as dental surgeon to the Clinic and it was decided to hold one weekly session to commence with. The first session was held on the 6th March, 1939, and during the year 193 patients have attended. Patients are required to pay one shilling for each attendance made at the Clinic. This charge includes all treatment found to be necessary, with the exception of the cost of dentures, for which an assessment is made based on the family income, in accordance with a scale approved by the Council. 26 children requiring dental treatment were treated at the London County Council School Treatment Centres at a cost to the Borough Council of £9 10s. 8d. Minor Ailments. 52 children under school age were referred for treatment to the London County Council at a cost to the Borough Council of £16 0s. 4d. SANITARY SUPERVISION OF THE BOROUGH. Although the Sanitary Inspectors were called upon to assist at the outbreak of war in the initial organisation of units of the First Aid Services of the Civil Defence Scheme and one of them has joined the Army, it has still been possible to maintain the peace time standard of sanitary operations in the Borough. A total of 44,032 inspections were made compared with 48,962 in the previous year and a large number of sanitary operations were carried out at the instigation and under the supervision of the inspectors who served 4,144 preliminary notices. 1,304 nuisance notices were served. 125 houses, found to be verminous, were disinfested. The furniture of 260 families was disinfested by hydrogen cyanide gas prior to the removal of these families to the Council's houses or flats. 18 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1939. 729 rat complaints were received and the rat-catcher made 1,749 visits. A large number of rat baits were laid in the sewers, special steps being taken in this direction during Rat Week. 682 inspections of shops were made under the Shops Act, 1934. Mortuaries—Crematorium. 86 bodies were removed to Wandsworth Mortuary during the year, but none were taken to the mortuaries in Clapham and Streatham. As Medical Referee I authorised 146 cremations to take place at the Crematorium at Putney Vale Cemetery. HOUSING. 44 new cases of overcrowding came under notice during the year. 784 cases are known to have been relieved. Many of these families were transferred to the Henry Prince Estate which was designed for the relief of overcrowding and was completed during the year. The number of dwellings recorded as overcrowded at the end of the year was 374, but as it is several years since a survey of overcrowding was made this figure cannot give a true picture of the extent of overcrowding in the Borough at the present time. 1,679 house-to-house inspections were carried out, as compared with 1,720 in 1938. 27 applications for certificates under the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts, 1919 to 1923, were received and 23 certificates were granted, the other four applications being withdrawn. HOUSING ACT, 1936. The Clearance of Insanitary Houses. The redevelopment by the Council of the sites of the two following insanitary areas has been completed during the year:— Housing 19 Wandsworth Plain Area:— 91 "Red" and 7 "Grey" houses—149 flats erected on the site. White Square:— Group of five areas—100 "Red" and 66 "Grey" houses. The last 10 of these were demolished during the year. 181 flats and six shops have been erected on the site. The following areas have been cleared and the sites left with the owners:— Salvador No. 1 Area—23 insanitary houses. Blackfords Cottages Area—8 insanitary houses. Carpenter's Place Area.

The 16 houses in this Area have been demolished during the year. Point Pleasant Nos. 1 and 2 Areas Wandsworth. These Areas, containing seven and five insanitary houses respectively, were declared on 18th January, 1938, when Clearance Orders were made. The houses have not yet been demolished. Point Pleasant, No. 3 Area, Wandsworth. This Area contained 19 insanitary houses. A Clearance Order was made in repect of it on the same date as for the two previous Areas. Seven of the houses have been demolished. The clearance of the following Areas is in abeyance on account of the war:— Weimar Street Area.—Contains 21 insanitary houses and was represented on 1st October, 1937. When the London County Council were approached with regard to it they expressed the desire to deal with the Area themselves and it was declared a Clearance Area by that Council on 20th December, 1938. 20 Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1939. Cubitt's Cottages Area.—21 insanitary houses. Compulsory Purchase Order in 1938, confirmed by the Minister of Health. Houses still occupied. Saxby Street Area.—93 "Red" and 12 "Grey" houses.

Representations on the following Areas were made during the year prior to the outbreak of the war:— North Passage Area 26 houses. Putney Bridge Road/Frogmore Area 6 „ Putney Bridge Road Area 12 „ Demolition Orders. The following eight houses on which Demolition Orders were made in 1937 or 1938 have been demolished during the year:— 9-12, Calders Row, Streatham 4 houses. 14 and 15, Cowpers Row, Streatham 2 „ 5 and 6, Merton Cottages, Wandsworth 2 „ Nos. 1, 2 and 3, King's Arms Yard, Wandsworth, in respect of which the Council accepted an undertaking from the owners, in 1935, that the houses would be rendered incapable of being Housing. 21 used for human habitation, have now been demolished by the owners. Two insanitary houses—502 and 502a, Streatham High Road—have been demolished by the owners, no action under the Housing Act being required. Closing Orders and Underground Rooms. Three Mews-flats known as Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Lovetts Place, Wandsworth, on which Closing Orders were made in December, 1937, are now closed. The Closing Order made in December, 1938, on the ground floor flat of 41, Temperley Road, Balham, has been complied with. This Order was made by the Magistrate of the South Western Police Court following a summons taken out by the Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. During the year Closing Orders have been made and enforced on five rooms at 26, Hereward Road, Tooting, and three rooms at 31, Streatham Place. Four underground rooms which were unfit for habitation were closed by the owners after they had been notified that the rooms were unfit for habitation, and did not comply with the Underground Rooms Regulations. 16 underground rooms, where the conditions were similar, have been altered by the owners, and have now been passed as fit for occupation. Abatement of Overcrowding. Henry Prince Estate. This estate, 9.88 acres in extent, has been developed by the Council for the re housing of families in the Borough living under overcrowded conditions. Accommodation for over 1,700 persons has been provided in 21 blocks of flats, four storeys in height. All the flats have now been completed. There are 272 dwellings, comprising four one-room flats, 36 with three rooms, 88 with four rooms, 132 with five rooms and 12 with six rooms. 22 THE SUPERVISION OF FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES. The four Food Inspectors have been on duty continuously throughout the year and have carried out a large number of inspections of premises where trade in foodstuffs is carried on. Since the outbreak of war the Inspectors have co-operated with the Food Controller in dealing with the problems connected with rationing and the control of foodstuffs in war time. The number of inspections of food premises made during the year was 34,843, an increase of over 11,000 over the number made during the previous year. 22,297 visits were made to markets and stalls of which there are 182 in the Borough. Many of their visits were made at the week-ends, at times when much business is done. Milk and the Milk Supply. There are 167 registered dairies in the Borough and 509 dairymen, about two-thirds of the latter being registered for the sale of milk in bottles and cartons. Most of the milk sold by retail is sent out in bottles filled in properly constructed dairies. The quality of the milk is good. 1,032 samples were submitted for analysis and only four of these were reported against. The 1,028 genuine samples gave an average fat content of 3.62. Of the four samples reported against, two were formal and two informal. The two formal samples were 14 and 27 per cent. deficient in fat respectively. The vendors were prosecuted. One of the two informal samples contained 3 per cent. extraneous water; the other was 2 per cent. deficient in fat. 38 licences for the sale of tuberculin tested milk and 30 for the sale of pasteurised milk were granted. 44 samples of pasteurised milk were submitted for bacteriological examination and were found to be up to standard. Meat. There are now four private slaughterhouses in the Borough, and since the outbreak of war a Wholesale Meat Depot has been established at 666, Garratt Lane. The Inspectors made 1,354 Food and Food Premises 23 visits to the slaughterhouses and were present on most occasions when slaughtering took place. 2,703 animals were inspected before slaughter and 7,919 carcases after slaughter. The Wholesale Meat Depot was kept under constant supervision from the date it was opened. A number of organs, etc., found to be unsound or diseased were surrendered at the slaughterhouses and at the Meat Depot for destruction. 23 persons were granted licences to act as slaughtermen. 882 samples of other foodstuffs were analysed and only one was found to be below standard, viz., a sample of tinned spinach which contained zinc. 86 samples of drugs were analysed; three were found to be adulterated. Considerable quantities of unsound foodstuffs were destroyed on the request of the owners and the usual certificates granted. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. 324 applications were received for registration as sellers of poisons included in Part II. of the Poisons List. Factories and Workshops. The number of factories, workshops, workplaces and homeworkers premises in the Borough is given in the following statement, with the number of inspections made:— No. on Register at end of 1939. No. of inspections in 1939. Factories 627 389 Workshops 738 379 Work places 91 44 Total 1,456 812 Home-workers premises 583 212 24 SUMMARY OF THE REPORT OF Messrs. A. H. MUTER, F.I.C., F.C.S., and C. H. HACKMAN, F.I.C., Public Analysts. 2,000 samples were submitted by the Food and Drugs Inspector for analysis, 1,000 having been taken with the necessary legal formalities and 1,000 being informal samples. Only eight samples were found to be adulterated—two formal and six informal. The adulteration amounted to .2 per cent. of the formal, .6 per cent. of the informal samples and .4 per cent. of all samples, figures on which the Borough can be congratulated.
