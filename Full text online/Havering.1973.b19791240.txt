During August - September a large number of food complaints concerning various foodstuffs were received, all of the complainants stating the food contained an unaccountable taste which appeared to be a taint tasting of T.C.P. No obvious picture was formed at first due to the variety of the foods affected and the general distribution of the shops. After deep investigation it was discovered that the complaints were originating mainly from supermarkets and enquiries were made to the Ministry from whom it was ascertained that the problem was nationally spread; further enquiries made resulted in the discovery that a particular brand of dustbin powder had been released on the market with an improved and strengthened formula and that the container was not of sufficient body to retain the odour which was pervading all foodstuffs in the vicinity and causing the taint. The managers of the affected shops were immediately advised to withdraw the stocks of dustbin powder from sale and the complaints soon receeded.

Pasteurised Milk 61 (one sample failed the methylene blue test but passed the phosphatase test). Sterilised Milk 20 (all satisfied the turbidity test).

There is a further reduction in the number of samples of pasteurised milk submitted for bacteriological examination due to the removal of one of the remaining three milk vending machines - only two now remain operating within the Borough. Brucella Abortis No samples have been examined for Brucella Abortis as all milk sold within the Borough is heat treated.
