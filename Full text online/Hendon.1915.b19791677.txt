M.S.I.A ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1915. TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF HENDON. Ladies and Gentlemen,— I have the honour of presenting to you my 26th Annual Report, upon the healthiness and sanitary condition of the District for the year ending 1915. The sanitary tables and vital statistics included therein, and the matters specially reported upon, are in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, etc. Owing to the depletion of staffs in Public Health Departments, and with a view to economising the cost of printing, etc., the Local Government Board has permitted Annual Reports to be condensed into as few pages as possible. This I have endeavoured to do, but have carefully retained all the tables, and tabulated statistics, in order that these important continuous records be maintained. I have based, as in previous years, my estimated popular tion to the middle of June, upon the number of new houses erected and occupied, taking the average number of persons per house, as shewn at the last Census. 4 This method gives a population of 49,54 3 persons, not including those in Public Institutions. I also checked these figures by the Logarithm method, which gives 48,968 persons. Upon the former population the Birth and other Mortality rates aire based in the substance of my Report. Although a marked decrease in building operations occurred during the year. 501 new houses were erected and occupied, giving an increase in the population of 2,180 persons. The greater portion of the new houses were erected in the neighbourhoods of Golders Green and Child's Hill. From a perusal of the Vital Statistics it will be seen that the health of the residents has been satisfactorily maintained. The average Birth Rate for the past six years is 23.43 per 1,000 as against a Birth Rate of 21.23 per 1,000 this year. This falling off in the Birth Rate was naturally expected under the existing abnormal conditions. The corrected general Death Rate 10.44 per 1,000 compares favourably with previous years. The Infantile Mortality Rate, 73 per 1,000, is low and satisfactory. There was a considerable falling off of Infectious Diseases notified during the year, and no disease assumed epidemic form. The occurrence of other non-notifiable diseases, notably measles, was somewhat prevalent. The Isolation Hospital afforded the necessary accommodation for Isolation of Scarlet Fever .patients, and very little outside accommodation was required for other diseases. Fifty Artizan dwellings in the Child's Hill district are completed and occupied. The question of insufficient housing accommodation in Central and West Hendon, together with that of "Maternity and Child Welfare," and other projected improvements, owing 5 to the present unsettled conditions affecting labour, and financial problems, will cause delay in immediate advancement in these directions. Since compiling my Report, statistics and tables, the Registrar-General has forwarded me his official Estimate of the Civil population of the district, which he estimates at 53,184 persons. In his communication to me he states "That the war has made it impossible to adhere to the methods of estimation of local and national populations hitherto in use. Men of military age have been largely drafted to military training centres, or sent abroad with the Army, and the remainder of the male adult population, as well as, to a lesser extent, the female population, has migrated on an unprecedented scale into areas other than those in which it was enumerated at the last census." He has therefore arrived at his figure from information gathered from the National Register, etc., which he considers forms a more reliable basis of estimation. The Registrar states: "The question of the population to be used for the calculation of birth rates has also required attention. The births registered are not only those of the children of civilians, and the estimates of Civil population therefore form an unsuitable basis for the calculation of birth rates. It is impossible to frame any estimate that would give reliable birth rates, and it is suggested therefore that the birth rate for 1915 be based upon the existing estimated population for 1914." The Death and Birth Rates, based upon the RegistrarGeneral's estimated population, would therefore be:—Gross Death Rate, 10.86 per 1,000 ; Recorded Death Rate, 9.88 per 1,000; Corrected Death Rate, 9.75 per 1,000. The Birth Rate, 21.86 per 1,000. In March of this year I have information from a reliable source that between three and four thousand men are now serving in the Army from this district, and are mostly stationed or billeted in other parts of the country. 6 ACREAGE. The District covers an area of 8,382 acres, and the density cf the population is equal to about 5.9 persons per acre. Mill Hill equals 1.8 persons per acre; Hendon Ward 5.6 persons per acre; and Child's Hill Ward 12.7 persons per acre. 7 TABLE OF ACREAGE.—Number of Houses and Population. Localities. Acreage.

Last year the rateable value was £460,039, and this year it is £468,880. In 1894, when the first Council was elected, the rateable value was only £118,381. POPULATION. Population 49,947 Population, excluding Institutions 49,543 The estimated population given is to the middle of June, 1915. The population, excluding Institutions, is derived after deducting persons in the Workhouse and Central London Sick Asylum admitted into these institutions from outside districts. In estimating the population of the district to June, 1916, I find there has been a large increase in its growth. Five hundred and one new houses have become occupied during this 12 months' period, giving an increase of 2,180 persons. The majority of the new houses were erected in Golderr Green and Child's Hill. Taking the average number of persons per house for each separate district, as shewn in the population table, my estimated population of 49,54 3 persons is derived. VITAL STATISTICS. Births. Number of births registered 1041 Births registered but not belonging to district 13 1028 Births registered in other districts and belonging to Hendon 24 Net number of births belonging to district 1052 Birth-rate 21.23 per 1000 Birth-rate, England and Wales 21.8 per 1000 9 Of the 1052 births belonging to Hendon, 528 were boys and 524 girls, producing a birth-rate of 21.23 per 1,000 of the population. Last year the births numbered 1,143, giving a birth-rate of 24.12 per 1,000. There has been a decrease of 91 births, as compared with last year. The excess of births over deaths is 562. The decline in the birth-rats must be cxpected owing to the altered conditions during the war. The Births occurred in the following districts:— Mill Hill 95 Golders Green and Burnt Oak 33 Temple Fortune 203 Central Hendon 156 Child's Hill and West Hendon 277 Cricklewood 264 Registered outside 24. Thirty-seven illegitimate children were bom, viz.:— Mill Hill 3 Golders Green and Burnt Oak 1 Temple Fortune 4 Central Hendon 3 Child's Hill and West Hendon 9 Cricklewood 9 Outside the district, 8. 11-12 Vital Statistics of Separate Localities in 1913 and previous years, exclusive of non-residents in the City of Westminster Union and Hendon Union.

In Table III. the deaths are classified in districts, and under the various causes of death. The 155 deaths of nonparishioners occurred in the Hendon Union, City of Westminster Union, and at various private residences. Last year the deaths of parishioners numbered 402, shewing an increase this year of 88 deaths. The corrected death-rate 10.44 per 1,000 signifies the death-rate which would obtain in Hendon if the local age and sex distribution were the same as that of the country generally. The following shews the actual number of deaths which have occurred in each locality Mill Hill 39 Golders Green and Burnt Oak 18 Temple Fortune 98 Central Hendon 75 Child's Hill and West Hendon 107 Cricklewood 153 15 CAUSES OF DEATH. On reference to Table III. it will be seen that a complete list of all the deaths of parishioners is set out. The Zymotic Death-Rate for the year equals .78 per 1,000. La6t year this rate was .59 per 1,000. The deaths from diseases upon which the Zymotic DeathRate is calculated are as follows:— Small Pox Nil. Scarlet Fever Nil.

During the year 49 inquests were held in the district. Last year 47 were held. SENILE MORTALITY. Of the 490 deaths of residents in Hendon 94 were persons over 70 years of age. The. proportion of deaths occurring amongst those over 70 years of age to the total deaths was therefore .19 per cent. The following is a return of the number of persons dying ov?r 70 years of age in the different localities:— Mill Hill 10 Golders Green and Burnt Oak 4 Temple Fortune 17 Central Hendon 23 Child's Hill and West Hendon 17 Cricklewood 23 INFANTILE MORTALITY. Deaths registered under 1 year of age, 77. Infantile Mortality Rate, 73 per 1,000. Infantile Mortality, England and Wales, 114 per 1,000. Seventy-seven deaths were registered, as compared with 64 last year. Last year this rate was exceptionally low. On Table IV. will be found classified the causes of death. The fol'owing table shews the actual number of death. which have occurred in each locality:— INFANTILE MORTALITY TABLE.

Up to the 31st of August the Act was of an adoptive character, but was made a compulsory measure on the 1st September by the Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915. Miss E. Brice was appointed Health Visitor and School Nurse, and commenced her duties on the 1st February, 1915. The School work occupied a good deal of her time, so that the desired amount of health visiting and work under the Births Act could not be done. The number of births registered during the year was 1041. The number of notifications received by me under the Act, from medical practitioners, midwives and parents, was 806. With few exceptions the visits of the Health Visitor were well received, and endeavours in many cases were made to carry out the instructions given. Many of the mothers were induced to attend Maternity Centres. Generally ''boat-shaped" or medicine bottles were used, but it is satisfactory to know that the "long tube," except in two cases, was conspicuous by its absence. In all oases in which a separate cot for sleeping was not used, the parents' attention was specially called to the matter, and many of them improvised a separate cot. With regard to cleanliness there is still much to be desired, but generally speaking the condition in most eases was satisfactory. The babies generally appeared healthy at birth, and many were fed on condensed milk, the parent stating that cow's milk was too expensive to procure. The majority of the babies were fed naturally, and patent foods were very infrequently used. All cases of Ophthalmia, Rickets and other cases required many subsequent visits being paid until the children were well or on the way to recovery. The parents generally appeared to appreciate the advice which was given. 22 HAMPSTEAD GARDEN SUBURB. VITAL STATISTICS.

SCARLET FEVER. 116 casts notified. 87 cases removed into Isolation Hospital. 29 cases isolated at home. The incidence, of this disease has been very low indeed as compared with previous years. The disease was not prevalent in any particular part of the district, but the cases were more or less equally distributed over the separate localities except in Burnt Oak, where only one case occurred The 116 cases represent infection in 98 houscG. DIPHTHERIA. 63 cases notified. 32 cases removed into Hendon Isolation Hospital. 9 cases removed into London and other hospitals. 22 cases isolated at home. Sevetnty-one cases were notified last year, as compared with 63 this year, shewing a decrease in the incidcnce of this disease. Eight cases proved fatal. Tracheotomy being performed in several instances. TYPHOID FEVER. 6 cases notified. 2 cases removed into London hospitals. 4 cases isolated at home. Six ca;es have been notified this year, as compared with 26 cases last year, when an outbreak occurred in Child's Hill district. Two of the patients were soldiers, one of whom had been invalided home from France recovering from the disease, but both were evidently infected outside the district. 26 CEREBROSPINAL MENINGITIS. 5 cases notified. Five cases of this disease were notified during the year, all five cases proving fatal. The first case, that of a lady typist, was notified on the 30th March, and died a few days afterwards. Every precaution was taken. Two trained nurses were in attendance, and swabs were taken from all contacts, with negative results. The second case was notified on April the 5th, the patient being a young soldier 23 years of age, from a camp in Surrey, who returned home for the week-end. He was taken ill on the 3rd. On visiting the house I saw the patient with his medical attendant, and it was evident that he would die. I had him removed to the Willesden Infectious Hospital, where he died on April the 7th. All the contacts in this house, and the adjoining house, were "swabbed," with negative results. The third case was that of a baby, 9 months of age, who I saw with its medical attendant, and which certainly had every symptom of "Spotted Fever." The result, however, of the examination of the "Lumbar Puncture" did not support the diagnosis, but the case was treated as "Spotted Fever." The fourth case wa3 notified on the 20th of April, that of a lady, and the date of the onset of illness was the 15th of April. The case was removed into a Nursing Home and the patient died on 1st May. Swabs were taken of all contacts, with negative results. The fifth case, a lad of 15 years of age, was notified on the 27th of April, the date of the onset of the illness being the 24th of April. A "Lumbar Puncture" was taken, but 27 the diagnosis was not bacteriologically confirmed. Swabs of all contacts were taken, with negative results. The patient died on 28th April. In all cases thorough disinfection of bedding and infected rooms was carried out, and in no instance did a second case occur in the same family. PHTHISIS AND OTHER TUBERCULOUS DISEASES. 172 cases notifed. 93 primary notifications. 79 secondary notifications. 172 The primary notifications are notifiable on Form A., and secondary notifications on Forms C and D. Secondary notifications are those caaes already notified cm Form A, which are sent to me when a patient enters or is discharged from a Sanatorium, Hospital, or Public Institution. School cases are notified on Form B. The deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis numbered 39, producing a mortality rate of .78 per 1,000. The deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis and other Tuberculous Diseases numbered 46, producing a mortality rate of .92 per 1,000. During the year I received 93 Primary Notifications and 79 Secondary Notifications. Of the 93 primary cases notified, 81 were Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and 12 were other Tuberculous Diseases; 49 were males and 44 were females. From enquiries made it was ascertained that 46 patients had been received into Institutions for treatment, and many had received outdoor treatment during the year. Disinfection of bedding and rooms was performed in all cases where a death occurred, or where the sleeping room occupied by the patient was vacated for any other cause. Sputum jars were provided in necessitous cases, and disinfectants. 28 MEASLES. During the year 899 cases of Measles were notified to me by the Head Teachers of Schools, the majority of the notifications being received by me in the months of May. June and July. The disease was very prevalent in Central and West hendon and the Garden Suburb, although cases occurred in all parts of the district. Sixteen deaths occurred from the disease. At every house in which Measles occurred coming to my notice, a printed leaflet was sent or delivered containing important advice to parents and guardians explaining the nature of the disease, and the complications which may result from neglectful nursing, together with instructions as to isolation and disinfection, and how to protect as far as possible other children from contracting the complaint. A special notice with regard to the exclusion of School children is added to the instructions. ERYSIPELAS. 23 cases notified. Twenty-three casts of Erysipelas have been notified this year, compared with 33 last year. Necessary disinfection was performed in all cases. PUERPERAL FEVER. 2 cases notified. The cases were nursed at home, and both proved fatal. A midwife was in attendance in each instance, whose clothing and surgical instruments were disinfected. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS. 1 case notified. One case of this disease was notified from a family in the West Hendon district. 29 OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Seven cases of this disease were notified as compared with 6 cases last year. The School Nurse attended and gave assistance in several of these cases. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. The Isolation Hospital is a temporary building, and was erected in 1899, but many enlargements and additions have been made from time to time. A full description of the building and the accommodation it affords will be found in my annual report of last and previous years. The following shews the number of patients which have been treated in the Hospital each year since it was first opened:— Brought forward 659 patients. 1890 4 patients. 1903 80 1891 23 „ 1904 83 1892 23 „ 1905 74 1893 70 „ 1906 92 1894 66 „ 1907 53 1895 51 „ 1908 83 1896 60 „ 1909 175 1897 23 „ 1910 125 1898 86 „ 1911 100 1899 74 „ 1912 129 1900 41 „ 1913 102 1901 83 „ 1914 219 1902 55 „ 1915 118 ,, Total 2092 patients. The diseases treated were:— 1942 Scarlet Fever; 132 Diphtheria, 10 Small Pox, and 8 Typhoid Fever. During the year 86 cases of Scarlet Fever were removed into the Infectious Hospital, and 32 cases of Diphtheria, 30 SMALL POX. Arrangements are now completed under which the Council become one of the constitute authorities under the Middlesex District Joint Small Pox Hospital Board. The Provisional Order relating to the matter has now been confirmed by Parliament under the title of "The Local Government Board's Provisional Orders Confirmation (No. 2) Act, 1916." Adequate provision has therefore been made for the treatment of Small Pox in this district for many years to come. VACCINATION. I am indebted to Mr. Taylor, the Registrar, for my annual returns with regard to Vaccination for the year. The newly included figures in the Vaccination Table are for the year ended 31st December, 1915. Of the 1125 births on the Registrar's list, 628 were, successfully vaccinated, 374 conscientious objection certificates were obtained, and 48 died unvaccinated; 46 removed to other districts, and 3 were postponed by medical certificates. As in previous years, the number unvaccinated continues to increase, forming an unprotected population in the event of an epidemic of Smallpox. The continuous freedom from any epidemic form of this disease has strengthened the prevailing idea that protective measures are unnecessary, which is a matter for much regret. 31 Table giving Vaccination Returns since the Year 1901. Year ending 31st December No of Births registered during preceding twelve months. No of these Births duly entered in Register. No. of these Births remaining unentered in Register.

There is at present no Dust Destructor in the District. My Council undertakes a weekly collection of house refuse with their own plant, excepting in the Mill Hill district, where the work is done by my Council's contractor. Throughout the year 170 complaints were received at the Sanitary Office with respect to the non-removal of dust on the day for collection. Shortage of labour at the latter end of the year accounted for many complaints being received. The dust collected was, as far as possible, delivered at the Railway Stations, and deposited on railway trucks for conveyance to a suitable shoot down the line. Until a Dust Destructor is established nuisances from Dust Shoots will from time to time arise. HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, Etc., ACT, 1909, AND HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. I record the following particulars required by Article 5 of the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1911, to be included in my Report:— Number of dwelling houses inspected 63 Number of houses considered on inspection to be in such a condition as to be unfit for human habitation 2 Number of houses closed and demolished without ordersNil.

The greatest rainfall, 1.65 inches. The wettest month was July, 6.38 inches. The driest month was June, .71 inches. Total number of days on which rain fell, 166. Total number of dry days, 199. MORTUARY. The Mortuary is a recently erected permanent building, which affords ample accommodation for the needs of the district, and the building conforms with the requirements of the Local Government Board. Fifty-one bodies were received into the Mortuary during the year. CESSPOOLS, WATER CLOSETS AND PRIVIES. During the year 45 applications have been received at the Sanitary Department for cesspools to be emptied at 29 houses which cannot be drained into the main sewer. The work of emptying the cesspools has been carried out by my Council's contractor, under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspector. In the, process of emptying these cesspools when full about 115,303 gallons of liquid and solid matter have been removed. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. There are 9 slaughterhouses on the Register, 8 being registeTed and 1 licensed under the Public Health Amendment Act. The licensed slaughterhouse is at present disused. The slaughterhouses have beiem inspected frequently, and as often as possible at times of slaughtering. 39 The Central Meat Market being so near at hand, has the effect of reducing to a comparatively small number the head of cattle and sheep killed in the district. The carcases inspected at the time of slaughter were found free from any disease rendering them unfit for food. The slaughterhouses have been kept clean and in good condition. Special limewashing has been performed on request. and worn out offal receptacles have been replaced. FOOD INSPECTION. The various butchers' shops and other places where food is sold, or in preparation for sale, for human consumption, have been inspected very frequently. One basket of cod fish and one leg of pork were surrendered to the Sanitary Inspector for destruction, being unfit for food. Generally, the fruit, fish and butchers' m<at examined throughout the year was found healthy and saleable. COWSHEDS, MILKSHOPS AND DAIRIES. Number of Registered Cowkeepers and Dairymen 21 Number of Registered Dairymen and Milksellers 32 There are about 347 milch cows in the cowsheds, but this number fluctuates at different periods of the year. The majority of the cows are habitually grazed. In the past few years many cowsheds have been disused, and the number of cows kept in the district has greatly decreased. The sheds, milkshops and dairies were found kept in a cleanly condition, and any contraventions cf the Byelaws were brought to the notice of the occupiers and rectified. 40 DISINFECTION. 1089 visits have been paid to infected premises, for purposes of disinfection, removal of patients into hospital, and in making enquiries and investigations into the possible source of the disease. One hundred and ten rooms were specially cleansed on my certificate under Section 5 of the Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Act, 1890, which necessitated the stripping and cleansing of the walls and ceilings of these rooms after the removal of patients into Hospital, or on recovery of home nursed cases. All bedding and infected articles were disinfected at every house where an infectious disease occurred, and also all rooms occupied by the patient. Ten thousand seven hundred and forty-eight articles were disinfected, viz.: 329 beds, 3319 blankets, and 7100 miscellaneous articles of clothing. This disinfection work comprised a large number of blankets disinfected for the Military Authorities. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. During the year 73 bacteriological examinations in suspected cases of Diphtheria were made, as against 79 last year. My Council undertake to pay for such examinations where the patients are not in a position to do so. Diphtheria Antitoxin is also supplied to all medical practitioners resident in the district, and can be obtained by them from specified chemists on application. NEW BUILDINGS. There has been a large decrease in the building operations during the past year, as compared with previous years. The greater proportion of the houses have been erected in Golders Green and Child's Hill Districts. 41 Four hundred and eighty six houses have been completed for occupation, and 200 are in course of erection. At the close of last year 615 dwellings were completed for occupation, and 478 were in course of erection. The houses we.ro distributed over the district as follows:— Child's Hill Ward (including the Garden Suburb) 432 Central Hendon Ward 33 Mill Hill Ward 21 Total 486 The total number of applications before the Council were 133, embracing the proposed erection of 231 dwelling houses, and 37 offices and shops. Three plans were submitted for laying out new roads. DRAINAGE WORK. One hundred and twenty-six tests have been applied to housi drains and 6oil pipes by smoke and water to ascertain their condition, or in connection with the testing of drains after being relaid or repaired. The ground was opened for the examination of drains under Section 41 of the Public Health Act. 1875, at 18 houses by the Council's workmen, and the owners on receipt of a preliminary notice caused the drains to be exposed for examination at 33 houses. In all cases where the ground was opened, and the drains exposed for examination, defects were found, and in many instances the pipes were found to be broken, improperly jointed, leaky, or otherwise defective, and the traps, junctions and connections in various ways unsatisfactory. 42 As a result of these' examinations the drains at 21 houses were entirely re-laid on a good bed of concrete, with proper means of access, and on an approved system, and in 11 instances the drains were partially relaid, amended or repaired and left sound. In connection with the drainage work described, 36 manholes were built and provided, 10 interceptors were fixed, and 32 roil pipes and ventilating shafts we're repaired or reconstructed, and in all cases the water closet basins, traps and stoneware gullies, together with other sanitary fittings, were renewed. Thirty one houses were drained by a single drain and 2 by a combined system. None of the drains passed under a house. Seven main drains were laid with iron pipes and all others, and the branch drains with stoneware glazed pipes. Four drains were connected up with the main sewer, permitting 4 cesspools to be abolished. INSPECTION WORK. By Article 20 (16) of the General Order of the Local Government Board, 1911, "The Inspector of Nuisances shall as soon as possible after the 31st day of December in each year, furnish the Medical Officer of Health with a tabular statement containing the following particulars:— (а) The number and nature of the inspections made by him during the year. (b) The number of notices served during the year, tinguishing Statutory from informal notices. (c) The result of the service of such notices." The following statistical returns have been compiled by your Chief Inspector, Mr. S. J. Chapman, and submitted to me, shewing the work done by the staff in the Public Health Department. 43 From a perusal of the annexed table it will be see n that a very large number of sanitary defects have been successfully dealt with during the year. The inspections and re-visits made to premises were 3,610 and the. number of defects dealt with 1,080. Two hundred and thirty complaints were received by letter or verbally, and wire investigated; 851 notices, letters or cautionary notices, were prepared and issued by the Sanitary Inspectors, including 153 Statutory notices under the direction of my Council. SUMMONSES. Two summonses under the Public Health Act, 1875, were granted with regard to the overcrowding of a cottage. An Abatement Order was obtained against the occupier and the owner was ordered to pay 12s. 6d. costs. One summons under the Public Health Act, 1875, was granted with regard to leaky roofs and dampness. An Abatement Order was obtained, and the owner ordered to pay 12s. 6d. costs.

As in past years the Sanitary Staff has throughout the year carried out their duties in a conscientious and thorough manner. Your Chief Inspector, Mr. S. J. Chapman, has been ever ready at all times to further my wishes, and zealous in the performance of his duties. The Staff at the Isolation Hospital have worked well, frequently under difficulties in the present temporary hospital. They have assisted my efforts very considerably in connection with the hospital work. In conclusion, I beg to be allowed to thank the Chairman and Members of the Council and Public Health Committee for the support they have accorded me at all times, which has so materially contributed to the efficient working of the Department. I have the honour to be, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, F. W. ANDREW, Medical Officer of Health and Medical Superintendent of the Isolation Hospital. 47 Education Committee, 1915.

EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT on the Medical Inspection of Children (Year ended 31st December, 1915). Ladies and Gentlemen,— The Annual Report which I now have the pleasure of submitting is at the suggestion of the. Board of Education drawn up in a less detailed form than that of previous years. It will be noticed that the numbers examined are less than last year, but a much greater amount of work with respect to the re-examination of children suffering from defects has been performed, and in my opinion this has resulted in much greater benefit to the children themselves. The following is the list of schools with the number cf children on the books on the 31st December, 1915, together with similar figures for the previous year:— 50 school. CHILDREN 1915. ON ROLLS 1914. 1 St. Paul's C.E. 196 221 2 St. Vincent's R.C. 124 140 3 Bell Lane Council 679 698 4 St. Mary's C.E. 384 387 5 St. Mary's R.C. 118 128 6 Algernon Road Council 881 905 7 St, John's C.E. 169 243 8 The Hyde Council 794 803 9 Burnt Oak Council 222 244 10 Garden Suburb Council 663 660 11 All Saints' C.E. 386 417 12 Child's Hill Council 994 987 13 St. Agnes' R.C. 122 116 14 St. Peter's C.E. 38 44 5770 5993 The number on the rolls shows a decrease of 223 on the previous year and this is mainly accounted for by two factors —the decision of the Committee not to admit children under five and the number of children (about 40) who were released (after careful enquiry into all the circumstances) from further attendance at school for the purpose of entering into bencficial employment. Wessex Gardens School was not quite ready for occupation owing to the delay of the contractor by reason of his not being able to obtain the necessary building materials, but it is not anticipated that this School will be opened for some considerable time. The enlargement of St. Mary's C. of E. School has been completed, and the school work there is now being carried on under the best conditions. With the approval of the Board of Education it was not thought desirable to proceed with the erection of the Hale 51 Grove Gardens School at the present time, so that the accommodation of the district now stands at 7,139, which is 1,369 more than the number on books. CONDITION OF SCHOOLS. The condition of the school buildings continues to be very satisfactory, and careful attention is paid to all the sanitary arrangements. ARRANGEMENTS FOR MEDICAL INSPECTION. Owing to new regulations laid down by the Board of Education the systematic examination of the children has been somewhat altered. During the year the following groups of children were examined :— (1) Children entering school for the first time, (2) Children whose seventh birthday occurred during 1915, and (3) Children whose twelfth birthday occurred during 1915. The object in examining children in their twelfth year instead of the year of leaving is that defects found may be followed up and the treatment successfully Carried out before leaving. Under the old system children often left before any opportunity could be had of seeing that any treatment had been carried out. A very considerable advantage has been obtained by the attendance at these examinations of the School Nurse. All advice given is noted on the "B" Cards. EXTENT, SCOPE AND GENERAL REMARKS OF INSPECTION. The number of children examined during the year was 2,223. Of this number 495 were considered sufficiently defective to place on "B" Cards so that the cases might be 52 followed up in order to see that the treatment recommended was carried out. In addition to these, special cases were referred to the School Medical Officers for observation and treatment at the Offices. These cases consisted mainly of ringworm, of which there was a considerable number during the year. The total number attending at the Offices was 116. These cases received treatment from the Doctors and the School Nurse. Many of them were of an obstinate nature, and had to be kept under observation for months. REMEDYING OF DEFECTS. In the previous paragraph the method adopted in the treatment of Ringworm, Impetigo and obstinate Ringworm has been shown. With regard to other defects a very considerable improvement has been noted. In the case of nose and ear defects cases are now referred to the local Cottage Hospital, where monthly a specialist from London attends, and in this way a large percentage of the cases has been dealt with. A good many cases also attend the London hospitals. The total attended to at the local hospital was 83. The difficulty hitherto experienced was that parents would net take the trouble to undergo the expense of journeying to London, which generally meant a whole day. HOME CIRCUMSTANCES, Etc. I should say that the circumstances during the year were as good at any rate as any previous year. There was scarcely any unemployment, but there did not appear to be much diminution in the way of mothers going out to work. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. I am afraid I cannot report much diminution in this respect. For the last three years the attendance at the Schools has been greatly affected by infectious disease, but from previous experience I have found that such bad years appear to occur in cycles. 53 PERSONAL HYGIENE. There is still improvement shown in this respect, and the School Nurse is, as far as possible, keeping suspicious cases under observation, and the results are gratifying. Tables are appended showing the results and statistics of the inspections during the year. I have the honour to be, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, F. W.
