To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my privilege to place before you my report on the health and environmental circumstances of our Borough for 1953. As in previous years the report is in a condensed form, in accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular 42/1951, dated 10th December. The population continues to decline and our birth-rate has fallen from 17-4 to 15-0. Our death-rate has also increased but this is more than accounted for by the alterations in the allocation of deaths by the Registrar General as recommended in circular G.R.O. (M.0.H.) No. 4/1952. As a consequence, New Cross General Hospital is now regarded as a residential institution. This hospital deals with aged and bedridden patients previously resident in Bermondsey and Southwark; deaths occurring there are now allocated to Deptford instead of being transferred to the Borough of their previous place of residence. We had to accept 139 deaths during the year, which raised our death-rate from 11 Itol3 0. It also meant that our total deaths in the higher age groups from malignant neoplasm, heart and circulatory diseases and pneumonia and bronchitis, increased by almost 100. This seems to me to be not only an unfair load for our Borough to bear, but to vitiate the value of statistical presentation and analysis. Fortunately, our infantile mortality rate has fallen to the more realistic figure of 26-5, which is still slightly above the general rate for the County and proves the need for continued efforts in child welfare and care. During the year there were no maternal deaths. Once again infectious diseases declined, from 1,193 to 827. The reduction was due mainly to fewer cases of scarlet fever, measles and whooping-cough. Nevertheless, food poisoning increased by 58 and we has 102 cases of dysentery, mostly of the Sonne type. In all these cases rigorous preventive measures were adopted and there was close liaison between the general practitioners and this department as regards treat- ment, contact tracing and bacteriological investigations. There was an increase of 13 in notifications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, but a slight reduction in deaths: this is not an isolated trend, it is general throughout the country. Although fewer people are dying from pulmonary tuberculosis, due to the great advance in treatment and clinic care, the reduction of incidence of the disease is not so significant. Is this due to the fact that by Mass Miniature Radiography and the excellent arrangements for follow-up of cases and contacts at Chest Clinics more pulmonary tuberculosis is being found; or that we are looking for it more diligently; or are the preventive services in some way lagging behind curative medicine? On the environmental side, although progress is steady but unspectacular, much has yet to be done about housing, and the supervision of the health of the factory worker, especially the adolescent, is uneven throughout the country. Many factories have excellent medical facilities; in others, little if anything is done to ensure that individuals are fit and remain fit for the job they are performing. The extension of B.C.G. vaccination to many vulnerable classes, which is already well under way in the County, may help, but all present indications are that the same spectacular results from it cannot be expected as in the diphtheria immunisation campaign. There seem to be other constitutional and environmental factors at work. For the third successive year it is pleasing to record the absence of diphtheria. Unfortunately, there was an increase in the incidence of poliomyelitis from 1 to 11 cases. A careful check of all patients revealed no definite connection between them, nor could a path of infection be traced with any certainty. The majority of cases were in the younger age groups and in no case was definite relationship between immunisation or trauma to paralysis established. Details of one doubtful case, however, were supplied to the Medical Research Council. During the year the Department have been called to assist old persons living alone and unable to obtain proper care and attention. In no instance were compulsory powers for removal used and I am glad to record the help and co-operation which I received from Dr. Mester, the Geriatrician at St. Alfege's Hospital; no urgent case requiring admission has been refused. Similarly, officers of local institutions have afforded us every facility and have admitted needy cases for us at short notice. The shortage of housing accommodation and the continued necessity to use sub-standard property in the Borough still presents a great problem. Strenuous efforts continue to be made by the Sanitary Inspectors to keep such properties in reasonable repair and to reduce to a minimum the hardships suffered by many residents, but, of course, the only permanent solution will be the eventual clearance of large sites. I am glad to acknowladge my indebtedness to the staff of the Health Department. Similarly, the Town Clerk and other chief officers and deputies have shown me much kindness and help. In conclusion, I would like to thank my Chairman and Vice-Chairman and members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement throughout the year. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. STAFF Medical Officer of Health J Kerr Brown, B.SC., M.B., ch.B., D.P.H. Public Analyst (part time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0-93 and for deaths 1.02 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 880, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 153. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table I. The deaths are classified under the 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough 1,564 acres Estimated mid-year home population 75,030 1952 1953 Deptford London Deptford London Birth rate (per 1,000 living) 17.4 17.6 15.0 17.5 Still births (ditto) 0.24 0.34 0.25 0.38 Death rate (ditto) : 11.9 12.6 *13.0 12.5 Infantile mortality rate (deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live births) 31.8 23.8 26.5 24.8 1952 1953 Live births registered Legitimate 1,256 1,069 (adjusted for inward and out- Illegitimate 64 60 ward transfers) Total 1,320 1,129 Still births registered Legitimate 18 18 Illegitimate — 1 Total 18 19 Infant deaths Legitimate 40 24 (under 1 year) Illegitimate 2 6 Total 42 30 Total deaths 909 976* *Of this number 139 occurred in the New Cross General Hospital. The death rate for Deptford if these deaths were excluded would be 11.1 instead of 13.0. Section " B " INFECTIOUS DISEASES INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of cases of notifiable infectious disease was again below that of the previous year. Scarlet Fever cases numbered 79 against 140, and Measles cases 429 against 849 in 1952. Food Poisoning and Sonne Dysentery (often closely allied) showed an increase particularly during the early summer months. Wherever a case was reported, contacts were tested and very often other cases were discovered. All positive cases were given letters to their medical advisors regarding treatment and specimens were taken until the patient was clear of infection. Arrangements were made for food handlers found to be positive to carry on non-food-handling duties until successfully treated. Infectious Diseases.

Tuberculosis All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Sanitary Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing conditions and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected. The deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1953 were 19 males and 6 females as compared with 20 and 7 respectively during the previous year. Of the 19 male deaths, 6 were persons residing at Carrington House, a common lodging house for men which is maintained by the London County Council. Of the deaths from respiratory tuberculosis 14 of the 19 male deaths and 4 of the 6 female deaths were of persons between the ages of 15 and 65 years, whereas of the deaths from all causes, only about 28% were within this age group.

Examination not yet completed 3 4 7 Section "C " SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES ETC., AND FACTORIES ACT 12 SANITARY INSPECTION The deficiency in the Sanitary Inspectors' establishment to which reference was made in my last Annual Report, was continued throughout 1953. Despite the revision in July, 1953, of the salary scales relating to Sanitary Inspectors in London, advertisements failed to attract suitable candidates. The system of priorities which was instituted last year was continued but whilst this deals with the matters arising from day-to-day, other matters of long term value, e.g., Factory Inspections etc., had to suffer owing to the necessity of the District Inspectors being required to undertake additional territory. It is difficult to know what can be done to counteract this shortage of staff, which apparently is likely to continue until new entrants can be found to enter the Sanitary Inspectors' profession, but some method will need to be adopted in order that routine matters of great importance to the community can receive adequate attention. The total number of primary inspections during 1953 was 5,104, a decline of 1,731 on the previous year when we were only short of establishment for two-thirds of the year. The number of complaints fell from 2,560 in 1952 to 2,188 this year and whilst this could be regarded with some satisfaction, the decline in other directions could be a serious matter. Defects which were found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, together with the London County Council Bye-Laws and General Powers Acts, and it was not found necessary to have recourse to the Housing Act, 1936. A summary of sanitary work carried out in the Borough appears in Tables II and 111 in the Appendix to this Report. Smoke Abatement Complaints were received regarding smoke emission from factory premises on the fringe of the Borough, but as a result of informal action by the Inspector and intelligent co-operation of the management of the factory concerned, it was not necessary to undertake legal proceedings. Offensive Trades The one factory in the Borough at which an offensive trade was carried on was kept under constant observation, and after various experiments had been carried out, the complaints regarding the emanation of effluvia subsided, but a long period of time will be necessary before the results of the efforts of the Inspector and the management can be regarded as wholly satisfactory. Air Pollution The Health Committee of the Association of Municipal Corporations selected Deptford as one of the London Boroughs from which it would 13 like to have information on this subject in order to assist the Association in its preparation of evidence to be submitted to the Committee set up by the Ministries of Housing and Local Government, and Fuel & Power, to examine this matter. A special meeting of the Public Health Committee was held on the 20th October when I presented a report on air pollution in the Borough generally. The report was adopted by the Council at a Meeting on the 28th October, and details are appended:— (1) Sources of Pollution Pollution of the atmosphere comes from two main sources, viz., (a) Industrial and (b) domestic. It is estimated that domestic fires are responsible for about 50 per cent, of the smoke production throughout the country. In this Borough the proportion of domestic smoke to industrial smoke emitted is probably higher than this figure. Contrary to popular belief, noxious smells however unpleasant, either from polluted rivers or from offensive trades, do not contribute materially to the production of fogs or " smog " and are a separate problem. (2) Smoke and Fog Conditions A fog or " smog " (a combination of smoke and fog) is produced when a high concentration of smoke and sulphur gases in the atmosphere is accompanied by high barometric pressure, high relative humidity, little or no wind and a low ground temperature. These are the conditions which prevailed during the fog period of 5th—9th December, 1952, when in Deptford deaths from cardiac and respiratory diseases were more than double for corresponding periods of previous years. The elderly and the very young were most severely affected and, indeed, many are still suffering from residual effects. Smoke is due to the imperfect combustion of coal, especially soft bituminous coal. Perfect combustion of coal in an open grate fire is almost impossible and every open grate fire contributes its quota of smoke to the atmosphere. Industrial smokes are emitted for a variety of reasons, e.g. : (1) the use of fuels unsuited to the type of furnace; (2) too much or too little draught in the furnace; (3) draught not passing through or over the fire; (4) careless or irregular stoking; (5) the forcing of the fire on account of insufficient boiler plant; (6) obsolete furnaces and appliances. Smoke from railway engines, although not contributing a high proportion to the overall pollution, does cause serious nuisance in the vicinity of large railway termini. (3) Industrial Smoke —Statutory Powers In regard to industrial smoke, the powers of Metropolitan Boroughs are mainly governed by the provisions of Section 147-154 of the Public 14 Health (London) Act, 1936, and a bye-law made under the Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926. Every furnace used in trade or industry has to be constructed so as to consume or burn as far as practicable the smoke arising from the furnace. There are penalties for negligent use of furnaces, e.g., careless stoking. However, it is a defence in any proceedings for sending forth smoke, other than black smoke, if the person shows that he has used the best practicable means for preventing the nuisance having regard to the cost of installing new plant and to local conditions and circumstances. Even with these powerful legal loopholes there are certain industries which can claim total exemption and which are indisputably among the worse offenders; e.g., smelting of ore, calcining, the puddling and rolling of iron, annealing, forging, the carburising of iron, etc. The discharge of hydrochloric acid and sulphur dioxide from chemical works is controlled by the Alkali, etc. Works Regulation Act, 1906, which lays down specific standards for hydrochloric acid and sulphur dioxide vapour discharge. The enforcement of the existing smoke abatement laws presents certain difficulties, as the detection of offences is usually regarded as a task which falls to be performed by the Sanitary Inspector. In the course of his daily work he takes smoke observations and makes official representations to flagrant offenders, but smoke abatement work cannot be done efficiently as an incidental duty of a Sanitary Inspector engaged in many other equally important functions. There can be no doubt, however, that in Deptford representations to the executives of factories have had a salutary effect, although it should be stressed that industrial smoke originating in the Borough is not a serious factor. Deptford suffers more from pollution from neighbouring Boroughs. (4) Greenwich and Deptford Power Stations In addition to the pollution from normal industrial processes, this Borough suffers from being in close proximity to the large Greenwich and Deptford Power Stations, from which quantities of grit are discharged and the incidence of the pollution arising from this source varies of course, according to the direction of the wind. As the result of representations, however, improvements in the firing methods have been and are being made; old boilers have been scrapped; new grit collecting plant installed; more efficient smoke-gauges are in use and secondary air modifications have been made in both Stations. Some of the chimney stacks have been also increased in height and the smaller ones blanked off. Whilst conditions are by no means satisfactory, it is fair to say that there has been gradual improvement and there is hope for further progress. (5) Suggestions for Improving Conditions In submitting our suggestions for improvement, we desire to emphasise that there is no easy or immediate solution of the problem. There will have to be a gradual but determined and well-planned effort. No schemes which can be devised in Deptford will be of any avail without these efforts being co-ordinated with the remainder of the Metropolis 15 and without the encouragement, the co-operation, and the instructions of the Central Government. These are our suggestions:— (a) Domestic (i) Nuisance from domestic smoke can be overcome by the eventual abolition of the open fire burning soft coal. (ii) The design of more efficient appliances is important and smokeless fuels such as anthracite, coke, coalite and oil should be employed where possible. These, however, must be made available to the public at prices which people can afford to pay. (iii) Subject to (ii) consideration should be given to the possibility of requiring that all new dwellings should be fitted either with smokeless fuel grates or be heated centrally or by electricity or gas. (iv) The possibilities of district heating should be explored. In Westminster, blocks of flats are being heated by hot water from the Battersea Power Station on the other side of the River Thames, and it may be possible that Greenwich and Deptford Power Stations could be utilised in this manner for providing district heating in the Deptford and Greenwich areas. (b) Industrial (i) We have referred earlier in this report (paragraph 2) to the causes of smoke emission from factories, and the lines along which improvements can be effected are self-evident. (ii) Conditions in Deptford do not, in our opinion, justify the employment of a full-time smoke inspector, but in areas where there is heavy industry the employment of full-time officers trained as Combustion experts would clearly be advantageous. In this way a close and almost continuous watch could be kept on industrial smoke, and technical advice given where necessary. (iii) More firms should be encouraged or required to allow their stokers and firemen to undergo instruction on correct firing methods and boilerhouse management. (iv) Smoke abatement law in regard to industry should be made more rigid. Precise standards should be laid down and those heavy industries which at present can claim total exemption should be brought within the scope of the law and therefore within local control. (c) General Smokeless zones within which it is an offence for industrial or domestic chimneys to emit smoke have been created in some large industrial cities, and we are of the opinion that consideration should be given to the establishment of a similar zone or zones in London. Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and two Operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Sanitary Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out: — 16 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for Year ended 31st December, 1953.

A high proportion of business premises in the borough have their own contracts with private service companies for the control and destruction of rats and mice. This largely accounts for the smallness of the figure relating to business premises. Disinfection and Cleansing The use of the disinfector at the New Cross General Hospital was continued as a temporary measure throughout the year, the Bathing Station also occupying part of the hospital premises. Neither of these are entirely satisfactory. It is also anticipated that the Regional Hospital 17 Board will require the premises to be vacated in the near future. The construction of the new Disinfection and Bathing Station was commenced in December, 1952, and opened in January, 1954. The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:- Premises disinfected (infectious disease) 153 Premises disinfected (requests) 39 Premises disinfected (verminous condition) 448 Premises disinfected (removals) 3 Total number of articles disinfected 24,459 Books disinfected 198 Number of articles destroyed at owner's request 111 In addition to the normal disinfection some work was done for firms engaged in exporting second-hand clothing and rags mainly to certain parts of Africa where the clothing is not allowed to be imported unless previously disinfected. The total dealt with during 1953 was 2,160 garments. The charges for this service amounted to £7 16s. 0d. Bathing Centre Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 795 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies 49 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 493 Scabies baths for adults 24 water supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and efficient water supply were issued in respect of 80 new premises. 18 THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following is an epitomised statement of the administration of the Act.

Section " D " FOOD AND DRUGS AND REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST 20 FOOD AND DRUGS A full-time Food Inspector is employed in the supervision of Food and Food Premises. Food Samples are sent for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and for bacteriological examination to County Hall. Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix Tables V, VI and VII and details from the Public Analyst's Report are included at the end of this section. Royal Victoria Yard Considerable quantities of food no longer considered fit for prolonged storage by the Admiralty, are examined in order to assess their fitness for sale to the general public. Ice-Cream Forty-one samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Grade I 23 Grade II 13 Grade III 3 Grade IV 2 41 Labelling of Food Orders, 1946/50 All pre-packed samples of food submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were considered also under the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946 and 1950. Fifty-one separate examinations were made under these Orders and two slight infringements were dealt with by correspondance. Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941 All pre-packed drugs submitted under the Food and Drugs Act were also considered under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. Food Standards Fifty-one samples were specially examined under the various Food Standard Orders. In three instances infringements were dealt with by informal action. Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations Wherever desirable Food and Drugs Act samples were examined for the presence of prohibited preservatives and colouring matters and for excessive amounts of the permitted preservatives. One infringement was dealt with informally. Mineral Oil in Food Order 1949 Sixty-eight samples were taken under the Order —no contraventions were found. 21 School Milks Eighteen samples were sent for chemical examination and fifteen were sent for bacteriological examination. Milk (Special Designations) Act Thirty-three samples were submitted. Foreign Bodies in Food Several instances were found of foreign bodies in food. In the main, insufficient evidence was available to ensure successful prosecution and the makers of the food in question were submitted. Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949-50 Dealers Licences issued: Tuberculin Tested Milk 20 Pasteurised Milk 59 Sterilised Milk 104 Supplementary Licences issued: Tuberculin Tested Milk 15 Pasteurised Milk 15 Sterilised Milk 18 FOOD AND DRUGS ANALYSIS Food and Drugs Analysis During the year, 485 samples were submitted for analysis under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, by your Sampling Officers. These samples were also examined wherever applicable under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, the Food Standards Orders, 1944-51, and the Labelling of Food Orders, 1946-51. Of the total number, 45 were taken formally, in accordance with the procedure prescribed under the Food and Drugs Act, the remaining 440 being undivided, or informal samples. The Public Analyst, Dr. H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., has submitted the following report on milk sampling:— " I have pleasure in furnishing the following particulars, summarising the composition of the milk samples submitted for analysis during the year 1953. 72 samples of milk were submitted for analysis during the year, of which 42 are understood to have been taken on Sundays and 30 on week-days. This is the lowest number of milk samples submitted in any year since I have been associated with the Borough (1934). One sample of milk was reported as " adulterated," being 5 per cent, deficient in fat, giving an " adulteration " percentage of 1.4. The average percentage composition of the samples is shown in the following Table, with the averages of the six preceding years for comparison: 22 AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF MILK, DEPTFORD Period Fat Solids-not-fat Total Solids 1947 3.51 8.68 12.19 1948 3.45 8.72 12.17 1949 3.47 8.74 12.21 1950 3.44 8.70 12.14 1951 3.52 8.63 12.15 1952 3.48 8.69 12.17 1953 3.44 8.69 1213 As will be seen, the analyses show very little variation from year to year since the end of the war, due no doubt to the greater part of the Metropolitan supply being bulked milk. No samples were submitted during February, but the 19 samples analysed during March and April again show the seasonal fall in quality noted in recent years. Period Fat Solids-not-fat Total Solids March-April, 1953 3.28 8.55 11.83 As will be commonly known, the seasonal fall in the late Winter months and the general downward trend in quality experienced during the past 50 years have been the subject of much discussion recently in Parliamentary circles, and although an amendment to the new Food and Drugs Bill, designed to arrest the fall by imposing a rigid legal standard in addition to the present presumptive one, failed to be adopted, assurances were given by Government spokesmen of their aim to raise the level of milk quality. A campaign among the farming community and the distributors was proposed as a means to this end, payment by quality being regarded as a cumbersome and impracticable system. In addition to the analyses under the Food and Drugs Act, 123 samples were examined under other Acts, Orders and Regulations. Particulars of these samples are furnished below:— Relevant Act or Order Number of Samples Number Failing to Comply Artical Nature of Irregularity Food Standards (Liquid Coffee Essences) Order, 1945 Coffee and Chicory Essence 4 0 Food Standards (Self-raising Flour) Order, 1946 Self-raising Flour 6 0 Jam I Food Standards (Preserves) Orders, 1944- 1953 3 0 Marmalade 5 0 Mincemeat 6 0 23 Relevant Act or Order Number of Samples Number Failing to Comply.

The requisitioned properties housed 2,042 units of tenancy. During 1953, 68 flats and 10 maisonettes were completed for the Council, and 3 houses and 34 flats were in the course of construction. During 1953, 4,583 improvements were carried out in 1,534 houses, somewhat less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 306. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1953:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 2,424 Number of Statutory Notices served 726 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 1,534 Overcrowing Number of individual dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 82 Number of families found to be living in overcrowded conditions during year 14 Number of families who have obtained alternative accommodation during year 5 There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts Certificates of Disrepair were granted in 5 cases during the year. Slum Clearance In connection with the Slum Clearance Programme for 1956-60, a survey was carried out in August and September, and a list of properties, to which were accorded either first or second stages of priority, was submitted with my recommendation for clearance. No doubt in due course definite allocations between Borough and County will be decided by mutual arrangement. Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 28 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The London County Council, as the Local Health Authority, became responsible for the health services set out in Part 111 of the National Health Service Act on sth July, 1948. These services are now commonly referred to as the " personal " health services as distinct from the environmental health services for which the Metropolitan Borough continue to be reponsible. The services which are provided at the various clinics are as follows :- Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.E. 14. Infant Welfare, Toddlers, and Ante-Natal clinics. Ante-Natal exercise clinic. Vaccination and Immunisation. Artificial sunlight. Rheumatism and nutrition clinics. Foot clinic. Mothercraft class. St. George's Hall, Shardeloes Road, S.E.4. Infant Welfare and Ante-natal clinics. St. Luke's Hall, Gosterwood Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare clinic. Princess Louise Institute, Hales Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare clinic. St. John's Nurses' Home, Watson Street, S.E.8. Ante-natal clinic. School Treatment Centre, Reginald Square. Dental clinic. Ophthalmic clinic. Minor Ailment clinic. Speech Therapy. Ear, Nose and Throat clinic. The County Council also maintains a Day Nursery. The headquarters of the Divisional Medical Officer are at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street. Section " G " MISCELLANEOUS 30 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection.. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service During the early part of the year we continued to use the bacteriological laboratory at Park Hospital. We were then invited to send our samples and specimens to the Medical Research laboratory at County Hall. We were reluctant to transfer in view of the excellent service and co-operation which we had received from Dr. Bailey at the Park Hospital and also because the laboratory was easily accessible from Deptford. However, the majority of our samples are now being sent to County Hall but the clinical items, such as faeces specimens, continue to go to the Park Hospital as a matter of convenience. The laboratory facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, continue to be available for the examination of swabs and other specimens sent by general practitioners. A week-end service is provided here and it is rather more convenient for the general practitioner to call for a consultation with the pathologist—a matter of some importance with the increasing complexity of bacteriological examinations. Mortuary and Coroner's Court Before the war both the Boroughs of Deptford and Greenwich maintained their own mortuaries and coroner's courts. By arrangement, and following war damage, the coroner's court at Deptford and the mortuary at Greenwich have been closed. The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this 31 arrangement, greatly increased. The number of bodies received during 1953 was 583. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. Nine persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1953. Removal of Aged and Infirm persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged but it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year as persuasive methods prevailed. Services for Old peoples The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five Darby and Joan Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the district. In addition, the Albany Institute Old People's Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. A Meals-on-Wheels service operates in the Borough. This supplies meals to aged and infirm people in their homes twice a week, to five of the Darby and Joan Clubs once a week, and to the Albany Institute daily from Monday to Friday. The meals are obtained from the London County Council's meals service and supplied to the old people at a charge of 10d. each. The vehicle was supplied and fitted by the Borough Council, which also provides the driver and maintains the vehicle. The remainder of the work is done by members of the W.V.S. During the year 4,676 meals were supplied. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Sanitary Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Slaughter Houses Two slaughter houses are licensed in this Borough but were not in use during the year. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of 32 filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at Ilderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Six applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 16 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Seventy-five examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon.
