April, 1954 To the Chairman and Members of the Ruislip-Sorthwood Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, This Annual Report for the year 1953 is the first 1 have had the privilege of submitting to you. Since it was as late in the year as October 1st when I took up my duties as Medical Officer of Health, the report is largely an account of the final year's working of the Public Health Department under the direction of my predecessor, Dr. L.D. Bailey, and I would like here to pay tribute to his kindness and thoughtfulness for the painstaking way in which he introduced me to the various problems of the office. The mid-year population of the district is now given as 72,130 and there are 20,312 inhabited dwellings. Although the population and the number of houses continue to increase, the vital statistics of the district may be said to remain satisfactory, as reference to the table of comparative statistics will show. The Infant Mortality rate is usually regarded as a test of the services in a district and, although subject to annual fluctuations owing to the smallness of the figures involved, over a period there has been a steady decline. I have introduced a graph to illustrate this, and to show the remarkable progress in the saving of infant life that has been made. There has been no case of diphtheria in the district - thanks to the continued co-operation of parents in having their children immunised, The stage has now been reached when people have forgotten, or have had no experience of, the tragedies which used to occur with such appalling frequency twenty years ago. This tends 2 to make the maintenance of a high level of immunity difficult immunity in children now must be wholly artificial, as the natural immunity caused by attacks of diphtheria is non-existent. It is not always easy to persuade parents to protect their children against a danger of which they have no personal knowledge. Similarly, the district has been fortunate in having had no case of smallpox. The nearness of London and Northolt Airports constantly reminds one of the ever present danger of the possible importation of a case, and of the consequences which could follow. The only protection against smallpox is efficient vaccination, and the most satisfactory time for vaccination to be done is in infancy. Then the reaction is least, and complications are almost unknown. Further, revaccination, if required because of contact with the disease, or for purposes of travel abroad, then becomes a simple procedure, whereas primary vaccination in an adolescent or an adult can be a much more painful and disturbing undertaking. The incidence of poliomyelitis declined during the year, and there were eight fewer cases than in the previous year. Much work is being done on the problems associated with the transmission of this disease, but there is still a great deal to be learnt, and in the present state of knowledge it is probable that scattered cases and even epidemics will occur from time to time. The routine work of the Department in connection with food premises has been steadily pursued during the year. Personal contact with the food trader and food handler is, I am convinced the correct method, and although not spectacular, is bound to bring results in time During the year the Mass X-Ray Unit visited the district, and the results of the survey are given in the Report. Finally, I would like to thank the Chief Sanitary Inspector and the other members of the Staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal support to me, and also the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their great interest and help in the working of the Department. I am, Your obedient Servant, O. C. DOBSON Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS ACREAGE OF THE DISTRICT Northwood Ward 2,088 acres Eastcote Ward 1,231 acres Ruislip Ward 1,757 acres South Ruislip Ward 1,507 acres 6,583 acres POPULATION The Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the mid-year:- 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 66,010 67,090 69,640 71,220 72,130 Population Census, 1951 68,288 Number of Inhabited Dwellings 20,312 BIRTH BATE (1953) No. of Births Birth Rate Basis M.
