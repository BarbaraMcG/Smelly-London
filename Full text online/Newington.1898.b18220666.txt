1898. NEW 4 Annual Report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the PARISH OF ST. MARY, NEWINGTON, LONDON. LONDON: Printed by Order of the Vestry, by R. TILLING, 106, Great Dover Street, S.E. 1899. 3 TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, NEWINGTON. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report for the year 1898. It will he seen on reference to the various tables that the health of Newington has materially improved during the last few years. The death-rate is still above London as a whole, but the difference which used to be so wide is gradually being lessened. Life in our parish is, and will be, more pleasurable than in the past, owing to the many useful and educational enterprises now in the care of the Yestry. Baths and Wash-houses, Libraries, and Electric Lighting have long since ceased to be considered the heritage alone of the rich. In disease just as in affairs of ordinary life the education of the people is all important. I mention this for fear that the Vestry, who are always most considerate to me, may have thought at times during the year the question of the increase of the Sanitary staff was a little too strongly urged. I have to thank the Vestry for their courtesy and support, and the various members of the staff for the active interest they have taken in the work. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. a 2 4 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS. Area of the parish of St. Mary, Newington, 632 acres.

The Health Statistics of the Parish of St. Mary, Newington, for the year 1898. The year has been marked by a steady and satisfactory progress in all sanitary matters. It will be seen on reference to table 14 that excellent work has been carried out by the sanitary staff in improving the sanitary condition of a large number of the houses in the district. The system of inspection, instituted four years ago, has largely contributed to the lowering of the death-rate, which now stands at a point, 3 or 4 per 1,000 less, than in 1895 and preceding years. Drain reconstruction or amendment is proceeding at the rate of 1,000 houses a year. Floor ventilation and permanent ventilation to the staircases of houses, together with better paving of forecourts and yards, have tended greatly to benefit the public health. Very few houses in the parish are without a supply of water taken directly from the main. The dust collection has much improved during the year, and but a very small number of houses are without a metal bin. Associated with this improvement in house drainage, it is only fair that I should mention the public-spirited policy of the Vestry in reconstructing, at a very large expense, considerable portions of defective sewers. I may mention, as an illustration, one district, viz.: the Surrey Gardens Estate which had a very bad reputation for Diphtheria and general unhealthiness, and which was a standing danger a few years ago to the better portions of the parish. Since the re-construction of its 6 sewers the Estate has vastly improved in health. Whilst acknowledging the important work done in reconstructing dilapidated sewers in the recent past, the Vestry I know is fully aware that much more has to be done in that direction before it can afford to stay its hand. In mentioning the work done in improving the sewers of the parish it is impossible to ignore one very highly disturbing condition which in my opinion is an important factor concerned in the propagation of Diphtheria, and probably many other diseases, that is the periodic flooding during severe storms of the subsoil of the parish. Whether this flooding arises from the main sewers of the London County Council not being large enough to speedily carry off this additional storm water, or whether it is due to some hindrance at the sewer outlets to the ready flow of the sewage, I am unable to offer an opinion. The fact however is beyond question that when these storms occur the sewers are not only full, but there is a pressure of a column of sewage many feet in height on our house drains and connections, and in the case of joints not being watertight the subsoil is fouled by sewage. The effect of this is that, after a storm, many of the houses in our parish are in such a foul smelling state as to render them unfit for habitation. Various important matters such as the Infant Mortality in the parish ; Improved Methods of Disinfection; Overcrowding in the more densely populated parts of the district, have been fully considered, and circulars have been distributed having for their object the amelioration of existing conditions. POPULATION. The population, the rateable value of our houses, and rents go on steadily increasing. Our residents number among them but very few of the well-to-do, leisured class, they are for the most part "toilers"—artizans and labourers—who leave the district for labour in the early morning and return to it at night. At least 80 per cent, of the houses are occupied by members of more than one family. Many of the young folk are engaged in service outside the parish, a very desirable state of things, but not one that benefits our death-rate, for as long as they remain in good health they live away, but when ill often come home to die, thus swelling our deaths 7 without adding to our population at Census times. The number of the population at each Census since 1841 was Population. Rateable Value. 1841 54,693 - 1851 64,816 - 1861 82,157 £203,059 1871 88,691 £304,736 1881 107,831 £405,396 1891 115,663 £461,723 1896 120,939 £494,695 The Registrar General's estimate of the population at the middle of 1898 was 123,183. The social condition of our people can be appreciated when the fact is mentioned that 29 per cent. of the population die away from home, in the Workhouse Infirmary and the various public hospitals.

The total number of births registered in the parish during 1898 was 4,165, of which 2,128 were males, and 2,037 females. This is 83 less than in 1897, and is the lowest number since 1892. The birth-rate is 33.8 per 1,000 inhabitants, against 34.7 for 1897, The birth-rate for London for 1898 was 29.5 per 1,000. 3 Birth Rate for the previous ten years. 1888 32.8 1893 36.9 1889 31.9 1894 35.4 1890 34.5 1895 35.4 1891 36.2 1896 35.2 1892 35.0 1897 34.7 The mean birth.rate for the ten years 1888-1897 was 34.8. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered in 1898 was 1800, of which 908 were males, and 892 females. This number was 94 less than that of 1897. Of the 1800 deaths registered as occurring within the parish boundaries, 62 died in the Newington Workhouse, Westmoreland Road. They comprised 30 belonging as parishioners to Newington, and 32 to other parishes of the St. Saviour's Union. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the parish, dying away from home, that is, outside our boundaries in the various Hospitals and Infirmaries, was the largest hitherto known, viz.: 752, or 29 per cent. of the "corrected" number of deaths of 2,520.

No case has been notified during the year. Deaths from Small Pox during the last ten years— 1889 — 1894 2 1890 — 1895 4 1891 — 1896 1 1892 — 1897 — 1893 6 1898 — SCARLET FEVER. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were 24, as against 33 in 1897. The total number of cases notified was 617 this year, and 769 last year. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0 20. Deaths from Scarlet Fever during the last ten years— 1889 43 1894 19 1890 37 1895 16 1891 17 1896 29 1892 45 1897 33 1893 51 1898 24 Of the 617 cases notified, 488 were removed to hospital with 19 deaths, a mortality of 3.9 per cent. 129 cases were treated at home with five deaths, a mortality of 3.9 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital was 79.0. The disease has been during the year generally of a mild type. In many of the cases the retention in hospital has extended to 10 or 12 weeks. It has been noticed that the cases so abnormally retained in hospital, when returned home, have exhibited a decided tendency to infect other children. This tendency has been seen in so many cases during the year, and when the possibility of other infection has been very remote, that I have come to look with some anxiety at children returning home after a lengthy stay in hospital. It would appear that many of these cases, although fairly well in 25 themselves, carry about with them, at least for the first week after their discharge, the power of infecting others. This power does not appear to leave them by any length of stay in hospital. It is a question to my mind whether it is a good thing to keep children so long in hospital as they appear to get the disease grafted on to them. The power of infecting seems to die off after they have been at home for a week or ten days. Such cases are a great danger to other children when they are brought into contact with them immediately on leaving the hospital. DIPHTHERIA. The deaths from this disease have increased in the year. The number being 72 this year, and 65 in 1897. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 459. The notified cases in 1897 were 331. The annual mortality rate was 0.59 per 1,000 living. Deaths from Diphtheria during the last ten years— 1889 55 1894 61 1890 32 1895 52 1891 44 1896 71 1892 38 1897 65 1893 93 1898 72 Of the 459 cases, 376 were removed to hospital with 57 deaths, a mortality of 1.5.1 per cent. 83 cases were treated at home with 15 deaths, a mortality of 18.0 per cent. The parish of Newington had the highest death-rate in Diphtheria of all the London parishes, with the exception of three East End ones, for the quarter ending 30th September. It had also a high death-rate from the same cause during the last quarter of the year. Of the schools, Victory Place School, Sayer Street, Crampton Street, Westmoreland Road Board Schools, and Sutherland Square Church School, were those whose pupils were most affected. I was able to prove after a full investigation of a large number of cases, that the school had certainly conduced to the spread of the complaint, notably so at Victory Place School, and at St. Paul's School, 26 Sutherland Square. In each case the infant department was the centre of infection. As will be seen by the large number of cases removed to hospital in 1898, much energy was displayed by the staff in combating the complaint. The removal in all the cases took place within a few hours of the notification certificate coming into our hands. Two spots, one at Lion Buildings and the other at Guinness's Buildings, Brandon Street, were much affected in August. In this epidemic of Diphtheria I was astonished to see how the disease cropped up in different parts of the parish, for although the particular house was thoroughly disinfected after the speedy removal of the patient to hospital, and no further case occurred in the family, yet the disease made its appearance at spots the most unlikely imaginable, and the patient affected was very often a child that had not been out of the house for weeks past, nor in contact with school children. I believe that this Diphtheria is in a large measure due to the fouling of the subsoil by sewage during severe rain storms, of which we have all complained for years past. In fact the commencement in the increase of Diphtheria appears to coincide with the time at which complaints were first made of the periodic flooding of different parts of the parish. I am sure that this matter of flooding calls for the serious attention of the London County Council, in regard to the capacity of their sewers. TYPHOID FEVER. The number of cases notified during 1898 was 90, as against 79 last year. The deaths from the complaint were ten this year, and nine last year. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.08. Deaths from Typhoid Fever during the last ten years— 1889 22 1894 14 1890 18 1895 15 1891 12 1896 18 1892 10 1897 9 1893 13 1898 10 27 Of the 90 cases notified, 60 were removed to hospital with six deaths a mortality of 10.0 per cent. 30 cases were treated at home with four deaths, a mortality of 13.3 per cent. WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease during the year were 45, as against 82 for 1897. The annual rate per 1,000 living was 0.37. Deaths from Whooping Cough during the last ten years— 1889 72 1894 75 1890 87 1895 72 1891 115 1896 66 1892 93 1897 82 1893 109 1898 45 TYPHUS FEVER. No death occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles numbered 55, against 85 last year. The annual mortality rate per 1,000 living was 0.45. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years— 1889 114 1894 103 1890 103 1895 132 1891 31 1896 98 1892 182 1897 85 1893 34 1898 55 28 TABLE 10.

The Vestry had under its consideration the high rate of mortality among children in the parish and the various means by which an amelioration of this serious condition could be effected. The Medical Officer of Health was directed to report upon the matter, and on his doing so, the following circular was ordered to be printed and circulated throughout the parish. Nestry-St-Mary-Mewington. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. GENERAL DIRECTIONS—How to Feed and bring up Infants (When a medical man is called in his advice alone must be followed). CLOTHING, AIR AND CLEANLINESS. 1. Infants must be kept warm. The clothing should be flannel or woollen, fitting loosely to the body. They should wear highnecked frocks with long sleeves, and when old enough stockings coming well up above the knees. Infants, well wrapped up, should be taken out into the open air whenever the weather is fine. They should be washed all over, at least once a day, with soap and warm water. The air of the room, especially the one in which the Infant sleeps, should be kept as pure and sweet as possible by opening the window several times during the day, and by leaving the window slightly open at night. Air breathed over and over again is very injurious to young and tender children. No one but the father and mother should ever be allowed to sleep in the room with the Infant and, if possible, the child should sleep in a cot by itself. Do not make the bedroom the receptacle for lumber that should find a place elsewhere, but keep the room as free of furniture and other articles as possible. Scrupulous cleanliness in all matters of child management is absolutely necessary if good health is to be maintained. c 2 36 FOOD. 2. The mother, if she is fairly healthy, is the proper person to bring up the child, and if she has plenty of breast milk the Infant should not have any other food whatever until it is seven months old. If this rule were more often followed many Infant lives would be saved yearly in this parish, and the mothers themselves would be in better health. The Infant should be suckled every two hours during the first month, and gradually less frequently until at the end of the third month it is suckled every three hours. At night the Infant, if sleeping, need not be suckled so often. It often happens that, although the mother is healthy, she has only a little breast milk, in that case the infant should have what milk is there, and in addition cow's milk and water in the proportions recommended for infants brought up on cow's milk alone. A superstition still exists that the two milks do not agree. It is a pure fallacy. When the mother has little milk it is as well for her to drink a cupful of milk half an hour before suckling the Infant. When a child is overfed it is sick, when underfed it is crying with hunger. Do not, however, feed it every time it cries, but keep as much as possible to the regular feeding periods. As a rule the Infant should be gradually weaned at the eighth or ninth month. Do not on any account give the child baked flour, arrowroot, cornflour, biscuits, or any so-called "Infants' food" before it is seven months old, as a young infant has no power to digest such foods, and Diarrhoea and other troubles are sure to arise. A mother should be careful what she herself takes during the suckling period. She simply requires plenty of plain and wholesome food. Stimulants are not necessary, and spirits are distinctly condemned. 3. When an Infant has to be brought up by hand, it should be fed out of a bottle, with cow's milk and water warmed. Fresh cow's milk should be used. The milk should always be boiled immediately it is received into the house, not only to make it keep longer, but in order to kill any germs that may be present in the milk and which may lower the health of the child. The water with which the milk is mixed must also be boiled. 37 4. Diet or Infant during the First Month. —Mix half-a-pint of boiled fresh milk and one pint of boiled water, to which add a teaspoonful of powdered white sugar. Of this mixture three tablespoonfuls should be given every two hours during the day, and every four hours during the night. Diet during the Second Month.—Mix three-quarters of a pint of boiled milk and one pint of boiled water with a teaspoonful sugar. Of this mixture five tablespoonfuls should be given every two hours. Diet during the Third Month.—Mix one pint of boiled milk and one pint of boiled water to which add the sugar. Of this mixture eight tablespoonfuls should be given every three hours. Diet from Three to Seven Months.—The strength of the mixture may be increased until two pints of boiled milk are added to one pint of boiled water. About eight tablespoonfuls should be given at each meal. Three tablespoonfuls of cream added to the daily quantity of milk and water before it is boiled for each period before stated would make the food much more nutritious. The quantities above recommended for mixing are for a twentyfour hours' supply, but it would be better to make half the quantity every twelve hours in order to ensure its freshness. 5. Condensed milk may be given for a time if cow's milk disagrees, but even the best kinds of condensed milk are unsuitable as regular foods for Infants. Cow's milk if discontinued for a time should be resumed again as soon as it can be borne. The kind known as "Condensed Separated" Milk, or "Condensed Skim" Milk should never be used as food for Infants. Children when fed upon it quickly waste away. 6. The best feeding bottle to use is the old fashioned boat shaped kind, with simply an India rubber teat and without any tube. After each meal the bottle should be rinsed and placed in cold water in which a little soda has been dissolved. On no account must the milk that remains in the feeding bottle after the child has been fed be used again. 38 No other food, except under the advice of a medical man, should be given until the child is seven months old. 7. When the child has reached the age of seven months it may have one or two meals of milk thickened with some " Infants' food." The other meals should be of milk only. The amount of the foods used may be increased as the child grows older. At the age of eight months the child may have broth, or beef tea, in addition to milk. At twelve months the yolk of an egg lightly boiled, or a little milk pudding may be given. At eighteen months give every day a little meat pounded to a pulp, or a little potato and gravy. 8. Do not give an infant, cheese, or beer, tea, or "just what the parents have." Do not suckle the child longer than nine months. Do not give infants teething powders and soothing syrups. Do not use feeding bottles with tubes, nor fail to well cleanse the bottle each time it is used. Do not fail to search for and remove the cause of all foul smells in the house, and if the assistance of the Sanitary Inspector is needed take care and send for him. GEORGE MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. 39 PHTHISIS. This disease has been one of the most deservedly popular health subjects under discussion during the year. Public meetings have been held in almost every important town throughout the country, under, in many cases, the most distinguished patronage. The importance of the subject cannot be over-estimated when it is considered that some 70,000 persons die every year from the disease in this country, and that considerably more than a quarter of a million persons are affected with it. It is however some comfort to know that within the last 50 years the mortality from this disease has diminished by one half, due, it is only fair to assume, to improved methods in relation to public and private health, the better feeding of the people attainable by higher wages, and let us hope to the improvement in the habits, exercise, and cleanliness of the community generally. Although this improvement has been observed in the country as a whole, London has not progressed in anything like the same satisfactory manner. Our overgrown city, with its marked contrasts in density of population, has in many of its parts remained more or less stationary. Our parish with a fifth of its population on the side of " overcrowdedness " has a death rate from Phthisis which places it very near to the worst areas. The disease is due to the introduction into the lungs of the tubercle bacillus, a microscopic vegetable parasite, through the medium of the expectoration from an infected person which has become dry, and, as dust floating in the air, is inhaled into the lungs. The disease is infectious, but practically so only to a limited extent, and to persons in a lowered state of health. It is not transmitted from parent to child as some diseases are, yet in certain individuals there is a distinct hereditary susceptibility which favours the growth of the bacillus in the lungs of persons suitably prepared to receive it. The chief causes of the disease are— 1. Poor food of a vegetable kind. 2. Dark and ill-ventilated dwellings whore sunlight and fresh air cannot enter. 40 3. The breathing of air over and over again in crowded rooms. 4. House dampness. 5. Dust. 6. Absence of proper exercise. 7. Chronic spirit drinking. There is a form of consumption affecting the abdominal glands of young children, called ''consumption of the bowels" which is thought to be due to the taking of cow's milk infected with the tubercle bacillus, and which can be prevented by boiling the milk when it is received into the house. It has been our practice for more than three years past to visit every house in which a person has died from Phthisis. To make a complete examination of the premises, and to disinfect when required. Directions for the Prevention of Consumption. Consumption is an infectious disease, though of limited extent in its infective power. It attacks weakly, ill-fed persons who take but little exercise in the open air and who live in dark and illventilated houses. The lungs are the organs mostly affected. The disease is spread through the expectoration of an infected person which is loaded with the tubercle bacilli, or small bodies which are the active agents in the complaint. Persons suffering from the disease should be careful to burn the expectoration, or sputum The expectoration should be spat into a. paper bag or piece of paper which should be thrown into the fire. It is not advisable to spit into the pockethandkerchief, but if, at any time, that is unavoidable, the handkerchief must be washed in boiling water as soon as possible. Glass vessels, or spittoons, half full of some fluid disinfectant, such as dilute carbolic acid (a wine-glassful of commercial carbolic acid to a pint of water) should be used when no fire exists to burn the paper bags. 41 On no account should persons affected with consumption expectorate about a room, or ou the pavement, or in vehicles, as the expectoration when it has become dry and powdered will float about in the air and infect susceptible persons. The small bodies (bacilli) are very tenacious of life and will live among the dust of rooms for a long time. A consumptive patient should occupy a separate bedroom which should be well ventilated by the window being constantly open. The apartments occupied by the patient should be periodically disinfected. In the early stage of the disease it is absolutely necessary that the patient should have abundance of nutritious food, plenty of fresh air, and exercise in the open air for a certain time in the day. When a person has died of Phthisis notice should be given at the Public Health Office at the Vestry so that the room can be disinfected. DISINFECTION. The disinfection of rooms and bedding has been carried out according to the directions which I submit. Various complaints have been made during the year of articles, such as sheets and blankets, being scorched and stained. I was able to show to a subcommittee appointed to consider this matter that it was impossible to scorch clothing with the machine we employ (Manlove & Alliott's). It was found that stains on sheets and counterpanes, which could readily be removed by washing before being put through the machine, were indelibly fixed by the disinfecting process. The remedy for this staining is of course the washing of the sheets before they are put through the machine, and this would have to be done by a steam washer. All infected rooms are thoroughly dismantled and bedding removed before the process of disinfection is commenced. 42 DISINFECTING STATION, DUTIES OF THE ENGINEER. (1) The hours of work shall be from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., one hour from 1 to 2 o'clock, being allowed for dinner. (2) From 8 o'clock to 9.30 he shall be engaged in getting up steam, the cleaning of his apparatus and station and in preparing for disinfection. (3) At 9.30 he shall commence disinfection, and the process shall be as follows, viz:—Steam is to be admitted into the chamber to a pressure of 10 lbs., after which a vacuum is to be drawn to at least 18 inches. Steam is then to be introduced into the chamber until a pressure of 20 lbs. is registered. This pressure is to be maintained for 7½ minutes with light goods, and for 10 minutes with heavy ones. A vacuum is then to be again drawn to 18 inches, which is to be gradually destroyed by the admission of air, the process thus being completed. Should any of the goods be found to be still damp, they must be returned to the chamber to be sufficiently dried. (4) He shall be held to be responsible for the safety and proper working of the machinery, and will be expected to keep the boiler, chamber, cocks, incinerator, and all apparatus in a good state of repair, and his station in a neat and cleanly state. (5) He shall wear a linen cap, coat and overalls, during working hours, which he must remove at all times on leaving the station. They must be washed once a week, care being taken that they are passed through the chamber and disinfected before being sent to the laundress. (6) No stranger is to be admitted to the interior of the station without an order, nor must there be any communication, 43 personal or otherwise, between the two sides of the station, after the infected bedding and clothing have been brought in and all infected coats and overalls given up, except by the external window made for that purpose. (7) The infected goods when brought into the station shall be delivered with an inventory, and care must be taken to keep the various articles from each house separate. Any verminous bedding or clothing must be disinfected by itself. On no account are articles to be introduced into the chamber in bundles, or in too large quantities, but all articles are to be so arranged as to admit of being easily penetrated by the steam. (8) He shall remove, as far as possible by washing, all stains on the articles likely to be made permanent by passing through the chamber, and shall also remove the leather buttons on mattresses and palliasses. (9) He shall keep a register of the articles disinfected in the manner prescribed. (10) He shall wash down the internal surface of the walls of the station once at least in each week and the floor of the station every night. Approved, by the Public Health Committee. GEORGE MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. DISINFECTION OF ROOMS. DUTIES OF THE MEN. (1) The hours of work shall be from 8 a.m. to 5'30 p.m., one hour, from 1 to 2 o'clock, being allowed for dinner. They shall, before commencing work in the morning, attend at the Depot to have their time booked. 44 (2) After their time has been booked at the Depot office, they shall proceed to the houses at which disinfection is to be carried out, in the order of the list delivered to them at 5.30 o'clock on the previous evening. They shall attend at the office of the Public Health Department to receive this list. (3) The process of disinfection, unless written instructions are given for any other mode, shall be as follows, viz.:— (1) The whole of the surface of the walls, ceiling, floor and the interior of all cupboards shall be well sprayed over with a 1 in 60 of a 40 per cent. solution of Formalin (3 ozs. to 1 gallon). (2) The floor, paint-work and ceiling shall be well cleansed. The paper shall be stripped off the walls, great care being taken to do as little damage as possible. The fluid used in cleansing and stripping shall be a 3 per cent. solution of carbolic acid, that is a pint of carbolic acid to a pail (large size) of warm water. (3) Roll Sulphur, in the proportion of 2 lbs. to 1,000 cubic feet of air space, shall be burned in an apparatus provided for that purpose. The room shall remain closed and under the influence of the fumigation for at least eight hours. The method of sealing up a room for fumigation shall be by closing the chimney aperture, windows, ventilators and doors, and by closing all cracks and small openings, either by pasting over them brown paper or otherwise plugging them, in order that no interchange between the air outside and the air inside the room can take place. No stopping of walls after stripping, and no re-papering or whitewashing of the ceiling shall be done. After the work has been carried out, a report shall be made to me on a form supplied for that purpose. GEORGE MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. 45 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The number on the register is 2. During the year various houses have been recommended by me for registration but the Sub-Committee having this matter in hand thought after an inspection that they were in too good a state to be placed on the register. Of course when my representation was made I held the opinion that these houses were suitable ones to be placed upon the register. It speaks much, however, for the condition of the pariah when no houses can be found debased enough for registration. BAKEHOUSES The total number of existing Bakehouses is 70. Many inspections have been made during the year. Notices have been served upon all those Bakehouses where such conditions do not exist to provide (1.) An impervious floor, either, 6 inches in thickness of concrete, flagging, or blue bricks. Casters on all troughs. (3.) Rendering of the Bakehouse walls to a height of 4 ft. 6 in. from the floor, with neat Portland cement half-an-inch in thickness floated smooth on the surface. Much of the work prescribed has been completed. I consider the Bakehouses in this parish are in a highly creditable condition. SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND COWHOUSES. Five Cowhouses, and nine Slaughterhouses were inspected and found to be in a good state of repair and in a clean condition. Slaughterhouses. Name. Address.

The total number of samples taken during the year was 799. The samples principally comprised Milk and Butter, which show a rather higher per centage of adulteration than last year. In my opinion the method adopted in this parish of each Sanitary Inspector taking samples in his own "Ward is far from satisfactory. I am disposed to think that, owing to the care and attention needed for this special work, the ordinary Ward Inspector, with his multifarious duties, is unable for want of time to discover the traders who find it profitable to systematically adulterate. We prosecute as a rule the little shopkeeper in the back street who is simply found with the adulterated article in his possession, and who is in many cases, I believe, utterly guiltless of any fraudulent intent. We have it on the best authority that a large amount of adulteration is carried on in this parish by some large shopkeepers, which, with the present system of taking samples we do not appear to be able to prevent. I have held for long time past that the only satisfactory way of working these Acts is to appoint an Inspector specially for the purpose. 57 TABLE 16. PERCENTAGE OF ADULTERATION. Article.
