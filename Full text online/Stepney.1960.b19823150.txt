TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY. Your Worship, Ladies & Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Report for the year I960 on the state of the public health in Stepney. I have now been your Medical Officer of Health since 1936 - 25 years, a sufficiently long period to have given me experience of pre-war and post-war Stepney. I have seen social and economic changes and witnessed their effects and, because of the drastic intervention of war, I have seen the face of the Borough changed and improved more in 25 years than it might have done in a century. It would be interesting, at least to me, to record in detail the progress made and the successes achieved since 1936 and to try and trace them to their proper source, but this exercise, fascinating though it would be, might also be somewhat disappointing. Much that 25 years ago appeared to be easy of achievement has proved to be difficult and has remained undone. It would be necessary to record both failures and successes - but fortunately there are plenty of the latter. Probably no borough in England has progressed more than Stepney and statistics illustrate this without comment. The contrasts in environment are now greater than they were before the war. Much in Stepney is now so new, so bright and so beautiful that a highlight is thrown upon the few black spots which remain and makes them appear all the darker. Sure and steady progress is being made but the pace is scarcely fast enough to satisfy those who, understandably, want things today and not tomorrow. The evidence of improvement has increased impatience and shattered resignation. Looking at the statistics for 1936 and comparing them with I960 we find that the population has decreased from 207,800 to 93*650; the number of inhabited dwellings from 37,237 to 25,934, and the density of population from 110.7 per acre to 53.14, which indicates a considerable decrease in overcrowding. The death rate, 11.05 in 1960, is the lowest on record, and the infant mortality rate, except for 1952, is also the lowest. The reduction in the infant mortality rate is generally regarded as one of the most reliable indications of social and economic improvement, 3 and it is therefore satisfactory to record that in Stepney it has dropped from 165 in 1901 to 18.66 this year. The enormous decrease in the number of infectious diseases and in deaths from these is also satisfactory. In 1936 there were 2,928 notifications and 181 deaths; while in i960 there were 835 notifications and no deaths. Tuberculosis notifications and deaths were 324 and 156 respectively in 1936, and 110 and 8 in i960. Since 1936, and especially since the end of the war, both the Borough Council and the London County Council have made great strides with the clearance of slum property and the erection of new dwellings. The number of dwellings in the Borough owned by the Borough Council and by the London County Council in 1936 was 1,947 or 5 per cent of the total at that time. By i960, this number had risen to 9>295 or 35 per cent of the dwellings in the area. During the same period the number of occupied underground rooms had been reduced from 6,000 to under 2,000. Overcrowded families on the 1936 register numbered 7,632 and at the end of I960, 357 families were known to be overcrowded. Since 1936 food hygiene in shops has greatly improved. Within recent years many foods such as butter, lard, tea, sugar, rice, cereals, porridge oats, raisins and currants are stocked in shops in the prepacked state and sold retail in the original package. We no longer see such foods exposed in the shops in open sacks anx boxes, nor the massive lumps of butter sitting (with the cat) on the shop counter waiting to be hacked and weighed in portions en the shop scales. Prepackaging and refrigeration have helped not only to keep foods clean ana hygienic but also to ensure their purity and uniformity of quality. The housewife is attracted by the convenience and cleanliness of such products and now tends to prefer potatoes, vegetables, chickens and other goods offered in the prepacked state, even if they are a little more expensive. * * * RATES. Death Rate: Number of deaths per annum per 1,000 population. Still-birth Rate: Number of still-births per annum per 1,000 total live and still-births. Live Birth Rate: Number of live births per annum per 1,000 population. Infant Mortality Rate: Number of deaths per annum of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Maternal Mortality Rate: Number of deaths per annum of women ascribed to pregnancy, childbearing, abortion, etc., per 1,000 live and still-births. 4 In the following paragraphs the statistics for this year and last year are compared, the latter being shown in brackets. According to the Registrar-General's estimate the population has decreased to 93,850 (94,900). There were 1,714 (1,811) live births and 1,037 (1,246) deaths. The live birth rate is 18.26 (19.08), the death rate 11.05 (13.12) - the lowest ever, and the infant mortality rate 18.66 (24.84). There were 2 (nil) maternal deaths during the year. 19 (32) babies died under the age of four weeks giving a neo-natal mortality rate of 11.08 (17.67). No serious epidemic of infectious disease occurred during the year. The number of cases of Measles (55) was the lowest ever recorded. The total notifications of infectious diseases was 835 (1,998), the lowest on record. The percentage of illegitimate live births of total live births is 12.95 compared with 11.26 last year, and is indeed the highest that it has ever been, but this trend is by no means confined to Stepney and appears to be an indication of the times. The death rate of illegitimate infants, however, has decreased since 1936 from 136.7 to 13.51. 'Deaths from cancer of the lung which have been steadily increasing each year, have this year fallen from 77 to 53. It is to be hoped that this downward trend will continue but I am rather doubtful that it will. * * * Today the care of the aged is coming more and more to the forefront. At the beginning of this century the ratio of old people to the rest of the population was 1 in 36; now it is 1 in 7 and in twenty years' time we may expect it to be 1 in 5. Their illnesses, chronic heart disease, bronchitis, arthritis, diabetes and cancer, necessitate prolonged occupation of hospital beds and the problem of their accommodation and care is far from being solved. In the text of this Report (on page 15) will be found an account of the facilities for old people which are grant aided by the Borough Council. The six chiropody clinics for old persons provided by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association continue to have full attendances, and, indeed, it is difficult to cater for all who require their services. One would have hoped that in the future the need for chiropody services would decrease, but because of footwear with sharp pointed toes and stiletto heels foisted upon women in recent years by shoe manufacturers, it appears unlikely that this will be so. Stiletto heels do damage not only to the feet of the wearer but it is calculated that they exert a pressure of 3 tons to the square inch and are reported to have smashed the bones of the feet of persons accidentally trodden on, and to have caused hundreds of pounds' worth of damage to valuable flooring and floor coverings. The majority of chiropody patients at present 5 are women but in the future they will be joined by those young men who today are wearing deforming "winkle-picker" shoes. * * * The Council's first smoke control area under the Clean Air Act, 1956, came into operation on 1st November on the western boundary of the Borough, and at the date of this Report the Minister's confirmation is being awaited of the Council's second Smoke Control Order. * * * In concluding my Report I would like to record my gratitude to the Chairmen and Members of Committees for their support and to the Town Clerk and other chief officers of the Council and the staffs of their departments for their help and co-operation. Finally to the staff of each section of my own Department I would like to express my deep appreciation and thanks for the interest they have shown and for the good work they have done throughout the years. I must especially thank those who have helped me with this Report and ' in particular the Assistant Administrative Officer for whose untiring work and assistance at all times I am most grateful. I have the honour to be, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. R. 0'SHIEL, Medical Officer of Health. 31st May, 1961. 6 STAFF OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT at 31st December I960 MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH F. Roantree O'Shiel, L.R.C.P.I., L.M., D.P.H.

STATISTICS AMD SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA General Information. The Metropolitan Borough of Stepney is bounded on the west side by the City of London, on the east by the Borough of Poplar, on the north by the Boroughs of Shoreditch and Bethnal Green and on the south by the River Thames, the river boundary being some 2.39 miles in length. The Borough is roughly rectangular in shape, the length being 2.3 miles and the breadth varying from 1 to 1-g- miles, and contains approximately ninety miles of streets. The area of the Borough is 1,902 acres, and of this the river accounts for 136 .acres, and inland water consisting of docks and canals covers 75 acres. Dark blue London Clay is found under the whole Borough at a depth of between 20 to 30 feet from the surface. Above this level are layers and patches of gravel and sand, brown and yellow clays being found nearer the surface. In some parts of the Borough there are layers of "made" ground, the result of earlier habitation, and as is to be expected the flow of subsoil water is towards the river. The area is to a large extent industrial in character, factory premises being spread throughout the Borough but tending to be concentrated towards the western end, with docks and wharves stretching along the whole of the river front which forms the southern boundary. The chief industry 'of the Borough is the manufacture of clothing of all kinds, and it is estimated that one-third of the tailoring industry of London is carried on in Stepney. Other major industries include brewing, cigarette making, engineering, and the manufacture of furniture. Stepney is also one of the most important wholesaling districts in London. The Spitalfields Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market and the London Fruit Exchange are situated in the Borough. Notable landmarks in the Borough include the Tower of London and the Royal Mint. Fifty Years Ago. The Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1910 contains the following information: The estimated population was 316,269, and the birth rate was reported to be 28.9, the lowest then on record. The death rate (uncorrected) was 13.5 per 1,000 population, and the infant mortality rate was 113 per 1,000 births. Among the causes of deaths reported were: Tuberculosis 547, Measles 93, Cancer 228, Premature Births 151, Diarrhoea 128, Enteritis 57, Whooping Cough 110, Alcoholism 30, Diphtheria 29, Scarlet Fever 12 and Road Accidents 22. Deaths of children under one year included: 103 from Diarrhoea, 40 from Enteritis, 58 from Whooping Cough, 33 from Measles and 190 from Wasting Diseases. There were 219 inquests on children under five years 9 of age, 29 deaths being attributed to overlying in bed by parents, 44 to convulsions and 13 to burns and scalds. Notifications of infectious disease included 498 cases of Scarlet Fever, 352 of Diphtheria and 111 of Enteric Fever. The Report contains the information that, at the time, there were 38 Common Lodging Houses in the area, providing accommodation for 6,900 persons; also 34 Cowhouses housing .795 cows. Of the 1,222 samples of food analysed, 155 (12.7%) were found to be adulterated, as a result of which 75 prosecutions were taken. 123 samples of milk and two samples of butter were found to, be adulterated. 67 samples of milk were taken on Sundays, 12.5% of these being adulterated. Twelve milk vendors were prosecuted for using dirty milk vessels and utensils. The Council's first Health Visiter, Miss Isabel Virtue, commenced work on 1st February at a salary of £100 per annum. The Stepney Invalid Kitchens recently established supplied dinners at a penny each to women after childbirth on recommendation of the Health Visitor. A person was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment with hard labour for slaughtering cattle on unlicensed premises and for depositing for sale veal which was diseased and unfit for food. Eight summonses were issued for carrying offensive matter through the streets during prohibited, hours. The Borough Engineer & Surveyor reported that the weight of street refuse- collected that year was 1,793 tons less than in the previous year and which, he stated, showed the influence that was being exerted by the displacement of horse-drawn 'vehicles for the new form of traction. Population. The Registrar-General's mid-year estimate for I960 is 93,850. Last year's estimate was 94,900; while the census taken in 1951 showed the population to be 98,858. The Registrar-General's Report on the 1951 Census revealed that the Borough's day-time population was 141,400 compared with 98,858 night-time population, an increase of over 44 per cent. The density of population is now 53.14 persons per acre. In 1935 it was 120 per acre. During the year there was a natural increase in population of 677; that is, there were 677 more births than deaths, The RegistrarGeneral estimates the population to be 1,050 less than last year, the indication being that 1,727 persons have moved out of the Borough. 10 BIRTH RATE 1935 - 1960 PER 1000 POPULATION INFANT MORTALITY RATE 1935 - 1960 PER 1000 LIVE BIRTHS Births. The total number of live births registered in the Borough, during the year, was 3,965 and of this number 2,4.05 belonged to other areas. In addition, 154 births belonging to Stepney occurred outside the Borough, making a total of 1,714 births (864 males and 850 females) to Stepney residents. The live birth rate is 18,26 per 1,000 population. The rate when adjusted by the comparability factor is 16,43, compared with the rate for England and Wales of 17.1. A graph showing the birth rates for the past 25 years is given opposite previous page. Illegitimate live births numbered 222, representing 12.95 per cent of the total live births. Still-births numbered 34, representing a rate of 19.45 per 1,000 total births. Marriages. The number of marriages in the Borough during the year was 797, being 37 more than last year. The marriage rate per 1,000 population is 17.0, compared with 16.0 in 1959. Deaths. The net number of deaths registered during the year was 1,037, compared with 1,246 last year. The death rate of 11.05 compares with 13.12 for 1959. The rate of 11.05 when adjusted by the comparability factor is 11.8 as compared with 11.5 for England and Wales. The principal causes of death were heart disease, which accounted for 30 per cent of the total deaths, cancer 20 per cent and diseases of the respiratory system 17 per cent. Deaths of persons over the age of 65 years amounted to 63 per cent of the total deaths. The death occurred in hospital of a centenarian, following a fracture of the femur. Details of deaths by cause and age are given in Table I of the Appendix, on pages 54 and 55. In England and Wales today, the expectation of life at one year is 69 for males and 74 for females, compared with 50 and 42 years respectively in 1841, and 59 and 63 between the years 1930-32. Infant Mortality. Deaths of infants under one year numbered 32, giving a rate of 18.66 per 1,000 live births compared with 24.84 last year. Chly once has the rate been lower. The rate for England and Wales is 21.7, the lowest ever recorded. Of the infant deaths 19 were under four weeks old, representing a neo-natal mortality rate of 11.08 per 1,000 live births. Last year, 11 there were 32 neo-natal dsaths and the rate was 17.67. The neo-natal mortality rate for England and Wales is 15.6. The peri-natal mortality rate of infants (viz. still-births plus deaths occurring in the first week of life) was 27.46 as compared with 35.17 last year. A graph showing infant mortality rates over the past twenty-five years is given opposite page 10. The Tables on page 56 show deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year, together with comparative figures over the last five years. Maternal Mortality. There were two maternal deaths during the year. The death of one mother, aged 36, was due to acute and post partum haemorrhage associated with a full term pregnancy and the birth of a living child. The patient was a multi-para and attention appears to have been fully available both before and after labour. The other death, of a woman aged 34, was caused by rupture of the womb due to retained products of conception. The patient recovered from a difficult labour and caesarian section and returned home. She died four weeks later from cause as stated. Accidental Deaths. The number of deaths due to accidents was 47, or 15 more than last year. These included 21 due to motor vehicles (13 more than in the previous year and the highest number for 20 years); 13 in the home; 4 at work; 2 from drowning, and 7 due to various other causes. (See Table on page 55 relating to Road Accidents). It is interesting to note that fifty years ago 22 residents of the Borough died as a result of road accidents. Accidents in the Home. Many more deaths now occur throughout the country from accidents in the home than from road accidents or from lung tuberculosis, and the public cannot be urged too strongly to see that all possible precautions are taken in the home to minimise them. The powers and duties of the Council under Section 32 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957, relating to the dissemination of information and advice for promoting safety in the home and encouraging proper precautions against accidents are exercisable by the Public Health Committee and the means taken to educate the public in this respect are referred to elsewhere in this Report. The County Medical Officer of Health supplies me with information which he obtains from the London Ambulance Service relating to the removal to hospital of home accident cases occurring in London and in the London County Council Health Division 5, of which Stepney forms a part. A Table summarising these figures over the past four years is 12 given on page 57. Whilst the figures nay not be fully comprehensive they give a reasonably accurate picture. During the year, the London Ambulance Service removed to hospital 178 Stepney home accident cases as compared with 175 last year. Old people are prone to home accidents and the Department's Women Hygiene Officers pay great attention to this during their visits; for example where accidents from gas appliances have occurred, or are likely to occur, they have been instrumental in obtaining for the old persons concerned a special safety-type gas cooker. Attention is also given in the homes of old people to oil heaters, particularly those of the drip-feed type. Advice and assistance is given to enable the old people to have these converted so as to conform with safety standards. Unemployment. The Ministry of Labour has kindly supplied me with the following information as to the estimated number of persons residing in the Borough who were registered as unemployed at the end of the years- Men Boys Women Girls 1,093 15 151 6 = Total: 1,265. The total number of unemployed at the end of 1959 was 1,854. Open Spaces. There is in the Borough two-thirds of an acre of Parks and Open Spaces per 1,000 population. Approximately 6f- acres of additional open spaces were opened this year by the London County Council whose intention it is to provide a minimum of 4 acres of open spaces within the County for every 1,000 population, with 2-g- acres as an interim standard. A list of the sites is given on page 76. Comparative Statistics. A Table showing vital statistics for the Borough at various years from 1901, is on page 58. 13 II. GENERAL PROVISIONS OF HEALTH SERVICES AGED PERSONS WELFARE. The Council is empowered by Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, to make application to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to a hospital or institution of any aged, infirm or physically incapacitated person living in insanitary conditions and who is in need of care and attention. During the year, it was necessary to apply for four Removal Orders and. one Extension Order under this enactment in respect of the following persons :- Age Removed to Remarks Mrs.L.D. 80 Hospital. Order for 6 weeks. (Died). Mrs.B.B. 67 Hospital. Emergency Order for 3 weeks. Extension Order for transfer to Institution. (Died). Mrs.M.R. 88 Institution. Order for 3 months. (Died). Mrs.A.B. 70 Institution. Order for 6 weeks. (Still away). In addition to those persons removed under Magistrate's Orders, admission to hospital or institution was obtained for 12 other persons. Two women officers, one of whom is a State Registered Nurse and certificated Health Visitor, are employed for visiting aged persons in the Borough, and 4,269 visits were made by these officers during the year. A register of all old persons visited is kept in the Department. Amendments made to the register during the year are as follows Number on register at 1st January, 1960 1,542 Additions during the year 481 Removals during the year 173 Number on register at 31st December, 1960 1,850 In November, 1959, a letter was addressed to some 300 persons and organisations whose work brings them into contact with old people, e.g. general practitioners, hospital almoners, voluntary and statutory welfare organisations, churches, postmasters, members of the Council, etc., reminding them of the services available in the Borough for the benefit of old people. Enclosed with the letter was a small poster, inviting people to notify the Medical Officer of Health of any old person found to be in need of care and attention, and a supply of printed postcards for use in notifying the Medical Officer of Health of any such person. As a result of this publicity, many new cases needing attention were 14 The Public Health Office in Wartime— a near miss on the morning of the 30th September, 1940. The Stepney Public Health Offices, 43, White Horse Road, E.I brought to light, but inevitably the source dried up. This year we embarked on another experiment to discover those old people who need help. Some of the Department’s outdoor staff during the course of their normal duties deliver postcards to each house in the Borough. So far approximately 9,000 postcards have been delivered and 275 returned indicating that persons required one or more of the services listed on the card. It has however been found on visiting that less than half this number really are in need of attention. The Department continued operating its Laundry Service (begun in 1951) for the chronic sick who are unable by reason of ill-health, senility, etc. to keep their personal laundry and bed-linen in a clean condition. During the year, 456 parcels of laundry were dealt with. In automatic washing machine of the type used in Launderettes was installed this year. In order to prevent injury, or danger of injury, to health, section 43 of. the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953, operated by the Borough Council, makes provision for the personal cleansing in their own homes of aged persons who are verminous or otherwise in need of a bath. 759 baths were given to 78 old people during the year by the Council's Home Bathing Service, which was inaugurated in 1950. Grants may be made under section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, to voluntary associations whose activities include the provision of recreation and meals for old people. Grants made by the Council to The Stepney Old People's Welfare Association and to old people's clubs, during the year, amounted to over £6,000. There are 19 old people's clubs in the Borough, sixteen being affiliated to The Stepney Old People's Welfare Association.* A grant of £500 was also made to the Workrooms for the Elderly, a voluntary organisation. This is an employment scheme for elderly persons which commenced in the Borough in 1953. The.Council is represented on The Stepney Old People's Welfare Association by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and other members of the Council and by the lviedical Officer of Health. Applications made to the Council by old people's clubs for grants under the National Assistance Act, 1948, are referred to the Association for investigation. The Mental Welfare Day Hospital, opened during the year at St. Clement's Hospital, Poplar, has been of assistance to our old people and early cases of mental deterioration have been referred there. The scheme is in its early experimental stage but is undoubtedly of benefit to those cases which in the past have been difficult to deal with. * Hon.Secretary, The Stepney Old People's Welfare Association, St.Katharine's, Butcher Row, Cable Street, E.14. Voluntary visitors are urgently needed and should apply to the Secretary. 15 A “Darby & Joan” All-Day Club was opened at new premises in Blakesley Street by the Women‘s Voluntary Service on 1st September. Another luncheon club commenced during the year at the Stepney Jewish Girls’ Club & Settlement, Beaumont House, Beaumont Grove. A list of clubs and the facilities thereat will be found on page 77. A Mobile Meals Service is run jointly by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association and the Women's Voluntary Service, and there is also a 'Kosher' service for Jewish pensioners operated by the Beaumont Hall Settlement. A weekly average of 690 meals were delivered to honebound old people during the year. Six of the clubs, which include a luncheon club among their facilities, provided an average of 374 meals each week. A Chiropody Service with a whole-time chiropodist is provided by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association at clinics situated in six of the old people's clubs in the Borough, and on an average 308 treatments were given each month, including domiciliary treatments. AMBULANCE FACIlIIES. The London County Council is responsible under Section 27 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, for the provision of Ambulance transport within the Administrative County of London. CONFERENCES.

Inquests were held on 62 residents of the Borough, the verdicts being 20 deaths due to road accidents; 20 other accidents; 16 suicides; 3 homicides; 1 misadventure, and 2 open verdicts. Burials. Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places a duty on the Council to arrange for the burial of any persons found dead within the Borough where no private arrangements have been made. Nine such burials took place during the year (6 adults, 1 child under one month, and 2 still-born babies), at a cost of £72, of which sum £33 was recovered by the end of the year from the estates of the deceased persons or from liable relatives or by way of grants made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. All the requests for burial came from H.M. Coroner's Officer. In 1948, the first year that this service was undertaken by the Council, 65 burials took place. It is often necessary where persons living alone have died in the Borough, to dispose of the contents of their homes. This is done in conjunction with relatives of the deceased, or with the Treasury Solicitor where there are no known relatives, and has the effect of releasing the accommodation for housing purposes as soon as possible. FREE WASHING FACILITIES. The Council provides free washing facilities in sixteen of the 22 public conveniences in the Borough, with the aim of promoting food hygiene and cleanliness. Some 93,500 free washes were taken during the year. HEALTH EDUCATION. Health education is becoming an increasingly important activity of local authorities. Every effort is made to reach as broad a section of the public as possible in the dissemination of publicity relating to general health matters, whilst educational material relative to particular subjects is distributed to selected sections of the public as applicable in each case. The Mass X-Ray Campaign took pride of place this year among the various publicity activities. Publicity measures used in this campaign are described elsewhere in the Report. The operation of the Council's first Smoke Control Order required, and was given, intensive publicity in that area of the Borough covered by the Order. The Council co-operated with the London County Council in its Annual Home Safety Week Campaign in November, with emphasis placed on the dangers from falls and poisoning which together account for some 75 percent of all fatal home accidents. In conjunction with the Royal 17 Society for the Prevention of Accidents, posters published by that body were exhibited in connection with “Check That Fall” publicity. We also co-operated with the Central Office of Information in a "Keep Britain Tidy" campaign organised for the August Bank Holiday week-end, and with the Ministry of Health in Mental Health Week. The former Empire Marketing Boards were used to display various posters during the year, as were also the Council's official notice boards and those affixed to lamp columns in street markets in the Borough. The occupiers of several large factories in the Borough and of some chemists shops are now accepting posters for display and leaflets for distribution. With the co-operation of the Borough Librarian bookmarks and leaflets on various health subjects were distributed from the lending sections of the Borough Libraries. Publicity was given to other subjects including diphtheria immunisation, vaccination against poliomyelitis, food hygiene, and to the Council's Holiday Centre. Enamelled panels giving details of hospitals and the tines of attendances where advice on, or treatment of, venereal diseases can be obtained were renewed, as necessary, in the Council's public conveniences. Vacant sites in the Borough were kept posted with notices warning the public against depositing rubbish and also against the use of land as caravan sites. In all over 2,000 posters were displayed throughout the Borough, during the year, and 42,000 leaflets distributed. HOLIDAY CENTRE. During the year 1,070 Stepney residents spent a holiday at the Council's Holiday Centre, The Manor House, Sandgate, near Folkestone, Kent. This number included 623 aged persons and 161 children. The total number of weekly bookings was 1,179. The Holiday Centre is open all the year round and is available for holidays to any resident of the Borough, young and old. Half the total accommodation is allotted to the latter each week. Coach transport is provided to and from the Public Health Department and the Manor House. The management and control of the Holiday Centre are vested in the Council's Physical Training & Recreation Committee, and the day-to-day administration is the responsibility of the Medical Officer of Health.

The water is subjected to a continuous chlorination and filtration process, passing through the filters once every 3½-hours. Ten samples were taken during the year for bacteriological and chemical analysis. Four were found to be unsatisfactory: one by reason of low pH value and three revealing a low free chlorine content. The number of Slipper Baths taken during the year at the four Council establishments was 223,809, which included 7,326 by old age pensioners and 114. by unemployed persons, who were admitted free of charge. The total number of persons admitted to all sections of the Baths and Washhouses Department, including the Laundry, was 479,751. 20 MATERNITY MP CHILD WELFARE.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES The District Public Health Inspectors served 3,089 Notices during the year, and in 27 cases legal proceedings were employed to enforce compliance therewith. At the end of the year the Department was still three below the establishment of district Inspectors. Aspects of the work of the Inspectors not covered in the following paragraphs will be found in the statistical appendix, pages 60 to 64. Animals. In January, an application was made by the Council to the Magistrate's Court for an order under Section 120 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, prohibiting the keeping of goats and a pony in a dwelling house in the Borough. An order was made prohibiting the keeping of goats and rabbits in the premises. Presumably ponies may tread where rabbits may notl Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act. 1957). During the year, 37 applications were received'from tenants for Certificates of Disrepair under the Rent Act, 1957. The Council exercised its right under Paragraph 5 of the First Schedule of the Act in refusing to accept undertakings from landlords in respect of nine premises. It is interesting to note that during the first six months of the operation of the Act in 1957, no less than 490 applications were received for certificates of disrepair. Clean Air. The Borough's first Smoke Control Order made under the Clean Air Act, 1956, was confirmed by the Minister of Housing & Local Government in May and came into operation on 1st November. The area concerned, situated along the Borough's boundary with the City of London, is one of 164. acres and comprises 1,979 dwellings and 938 commercial, industrial and other premises. A survey of the area revealed that the number of appliances in dwellings which were in regular use, and which required replacement or adaptation, was 1,433. Included in this number were 1,280 open fires, 86 per cent of which were found to require replacement with approved appliances. It is regretted that, at the date of coming into operation of the Order, applications for grant towards conversions received and approved amounted to less than 20 per cent of the total number of appliances requiring conversion. By the end of the year, approval had been given to approximately 50 per cent of the total. The occupiers of dwellings were apathetic in spite of the pains taken by the Department's officers to ensure that they had ample notice of the Council's intention to 25 include their premises in a smoke control area and to make them fullyaware of their duties and responsibilities. Posters are displayed throughout the area, and an explanatory letter and booklets are sent to all occupiers of dwellings in the area, who are also visited by the Smoke Inspector and/or Enquiry Officer. Forms are sent to each occupier to facilitate submission of estimates and claims for grants. In order to ease the burden of expense on persons who are having conversions executed, the Council accepts the assignment of grants direct to the contractor. By this means, instead of the person having to pay the whole cost of the work and then obtaining reimbursement from the Council, he pays only his own portion of the cost, the remainder being paid direct to the contractor by the Council. In addition, there is in the Public Health Offices a Smoke Control Exhibition which was opened during the year by Her Worship the Mayor, and in which are displayed various types of approved space heating and cooking appliances and authorised fuels. Arrangements were also made for the Solid Smokeless Fuel Federation's Demonstration Van to tour the smoke control area for a week. In December, the Council made a Smoke Control Order for a second area in the Borough. The Minister's confirmation of this order is awaited. Two applications were received during the year for exemption from the operation of Section 11 of the Act relating to Smoke Control Order No.l. One of these premises, where fireplaces are to be used for purposes of investigation and research, was exempted. Facing this page is a Map showing the first programme of smoke control areas established and proposed to be established in the Borough. Prior approval was given during the year to plans and specifications of furnaces submitted under Section 3 of the Act and proposed to be installed in two industrial premises, and notifications of proposal to instal furnaces were received in respect of 15 other premises. Measurements of air pollution are taken regularly in the Borough by means of deposit gauges and lead peroxide instruments, which give monthly records of deposited matter and of the concentration of sulphur in the air, and also by combined smoke filters and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus which afford daily readings. Summaries of the recordings obtained from these instruments will be found in Tables 12 and 13, on pages 66 and 67, and details of visits and inspections made by the Smoke & Factories Inspector are given on page 65. Drainage and Sanitary Conveniences. Considerable use is being made of Section 25(l) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955, whereby a Public Health Inspector can serve a notice on a person requiring him to clear an 26 STEPNEY SMOKE CONTROL AREA NO. I The Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation Exhibition Van touring the area. Hall fax Photos obstructed drain within 48 hours, and if the notice is not complied with during that time the Council may themselves execute the work and recover the cost from the person responsible. Notices under this section served during the year numbered 275, the Council executing the work in 40 instances. Factories. Under Section 128 of the Factories Act, 1937, the Medical Officer of Health is required among other things to report to the Council in his annual report specifically on the administration of, and furnish the prescribed particulars with respect to, matters under the Act administered by the Council. The prescribed particulars referred to will be found in the Appendix, pages 62 and 63. Fireguards. Of the 15 fireguards examined under the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Regulations, 1953, six fireguards to electric fires were found to be unsatisfactory and were withdrawn from sale. Hairdressers. Hairdressers and barbers premises registered by the Council under Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, number 142. During the year the Public Health Committee instructed that the occupiers of two such establishments be cautioned for carrying on business whilst they and their premises were unregistered. Legal Proceedings. Legal proceedings instituted during the year (other than those relating to food premises), showing penalties imposed, were as follows:- No. of Summonses Fines Costs Public Health (London) Act, 1936: Nuisance Orders 24 - £76. 9. 0.

An application made for the. establishment of a poultry slaughterhouse at 12, Princelet Street, was not granted. The premises at 14> Hessel Street were taken over during the year for the slaughtering of poultry for consumption by Mohammedans. Premises used for slaughtering poultry at 49? Globe Road were removed from the register, not having been used for more than 9 months. Rodent Control. In accordance with the requirements of the Mnistry of iigriculture, Fisheries & Food, statistics on Rodent Control work carried out by the Department during the year were submitted to the Mnistry. During this period 2,835 dwellings and business premises were inspected, and 1,316 were found to be infested with mice or rats. Treatments were carried out by the Department's Rodent Control staff to 1,042 properties found to be infested, the charges made for servicing business premises amounting to £369. By the implementation of Section 4 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 194-9) it has been found possible to clear bombed sites of refuse which would otherwise act as possible harbourage for rats and other vermin. 30 Moreover, under the same' section, which permits specified works to be carried out, it has been possible to require sites to be fenced in by the owners. Default action was taken by the Council regarding two such sites (comprising 22 premises), and the cost of removing the refuse and fencing the sites was charged to the owners. Legal proceedings were instituted against the occupier of a business premises for wilfully obstructing a Public Health Inspector in his attempt to gain access to a cellar to investigate rat infestation. A fine of £3 and £3.3s.0d costs were imposed. A copy of the Return furnished to the Ministry is on page 59. The Council carries out, on behalf of the Stepney Group Hospital Management Committee, any necessary treatments for rodent infestation at hospitals and other premises in the Borough which come under the control of that Committee. Shops. The number of premises in the Borough covered by the provisions of the Shops Act, is 3,038. One application was received, during the year, for exemption from compliance with sanitary accommodation requirements. A certificate of exemption was granted in respect of the premises concerned. Water Certificates. Water certificates as to new dwellings having a proper and sufficient supply of water were issued in respect of 420 flats and 36 houses, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Water Supply. The whole of the Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, which is the authority responsible for its purity. The quantity and quality of water supplied by the Board during the year have been satisfactory. All the premises in the Borough are supplied individually direct from public water mains. The number of instances where the water supply to premises in the Borough was repaired or reinstated following action taken by the Department totalled 88, and the Metropolitan Water Board was notified on 48 occasions where wastage of water was taking place. During the year, 20 notices were received from the Metropolitan Water Board of withdrawal of water supply: in 12 premises for nonpayment of rates and in 8 because of defects in the service. 31 Wells. Bacteriological and chemical analyses of water from 8 deep wells in industrial use in the Borough are made periodically and the results reported to this Department. All were reported as being satisfactory. Workplaces. There are known to be 521 workplaces in the area (other than those premises covered by the Factories Act, 1937). Work Executed by the Council in default of Owners. Work was carried out by the Council at the following premises, in default of the owners, from whom the stated costs incurred were recoverable Rat harbourage removed and preventive measures taken (Section 4. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act. 1949). 20/44 Watney Street £165. 11. 6 This refers to a large parcel of land, comprising 12 properties situated in one of the Council's street markets, which had been a source of nuisance for some time. After some considerable time and effort had been expended in tracing the owners, they eventually agreed to pay the Council's contractors to remove the refuse constituting the rat harbourage and to erect a fence around the site in order to prevent the accumulation of further rat harbourage.

During the year two areas, involving 178 houses, were declared as clearance areas by the London County Council. Closing and Demolition Orders. Demolition Orders on 14 houses were nade by the Borough Council, during the year, and 23 houses were demolished in pursuance of orders made. An appeal against a Closing Order nade by the Council under the Housing Act, 1957, was brought by the owner of one property, the case being adjourned sine die by the Court. Overcrowding. During the year 68 cases of alleged overcrowding were investigated, 26 of which were confirmed and were referred to the London County Council. Eighteen overcrowded families were rehoused by the London County Council and one by the Borough Council, The number of known overcrowded families on the register increased from 357 to 363. Underground Rooms. There are approximately 1,800 underground rooms in the Borough used for living or sleeping purposes, 1,760 of which are unfit. During the year 4 rooms were closed and Closing Orders on two rooms were determined. The number of underground rooms closed since 1936 is 451. Progress on closures generally is held up for lack of suitable alternative accommodation. Town & Country Planning (Housing Accommodation) Direction. 1952. Under this Order the Borough Council is consulted by the London County Council (the Planning Authority) before applications are determined for planning permission for development involving change of user of premises from use as a dwelling. Investigations of 28 such applications were carried out during the year. Applications for Rehousing. At the end of the year, there were 3,602 applications for rehousing on the Housing Manager's register. These included licensees of twelve requisitioned premises applying for transfer of accommodation and the tenants of 381 Council dwellings who desired larger or smaller accommodation. 34 Preferential Housing on health grounds. All the five cases investigated were found to come within the Council's Points Scheme. Standard Grants and Improvement Grants. In conjunction with officers of the Borough Engineer & Surveyor's Department, the Housing Inspector inspected 37 premises regarding which applications had been made to the Council for standard or improvement grants. Temporary Hutments. The remaining hutments owned by the Borough Council were demolished during the year. Requisitioned Premises. The number of dwellings remaining under requisition by the Borough Council at the end of the year was 14, involving fifteen lettings. The Council purchased 226 formerly requisitioned houses, and of these 77 were converted or improved during the year. New Housing. During the year, 456 new dwellings were completed in the Borough: 139 by the Borough Council, 313 by the County Council and 4 by private enterprise. (See Appendix, page 75). A total of 7,162 new permanent dwellings have been constructed in the Borough since the War; 4,696 by the London County Council, 2,266 by the Borough Council, 69 by the Corporation of London and 131 by private enterprise. Work was also begun in the Borough during the year on the tallest block of flats yet under construction by the London County Council, a 19-storey block, 180 feet high, which will contain 73 flats. Caravans. Several times during the year residential caravans were reported to have arrived in the Borough and parked on bombed sites. These were visited by the Housing Inspector immediately after the information was received, and the occupiers were persuaded to vacate the sites. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, in Sections 22 and 23, made provision for Borough Councils to grant licences authorising persons to use or allow to be. used land as sites for moveable dwellings, and on and after 1st October, 1960, it became an offence to use or allow to be used land for this purpose without such licence. The Council has adopted standards for use in licensing caravan sites. 35 V. INSPECTION AMD SUPERVISION OF FOOD A notable improvement in the food trade has been the increase in prepacked foods exposed for sale, and the wider variety of such goods. While prepacked foods are advantageous from the standpoint of food hygiene, there is a resultant tendency for traders to increase the types of foods for sale without risk of contamination. Thus it is now more common for butchers to sell prepacked grocery, grocers to sell greengrocery, greengrocers to sell prepacked fish, and fishmongers to sell prepacked vegetables. The quantity of unsound food condemned in warehouses and shops and the number of certificates issued have increased. This does not reflect a deterioration in the quality of canned foods, but rather that more shopkeepers and traders are inviting the opinion of the food inspectors before offering doubtful goods for sale. In addition, shopkeepers are returning suspected canned food to the warehouses, which increases the amount of food condemned at these premises and the number of certificates issued. During the year special attention was given to the examination and sampling of desiccated coconut, tea, and dried egg products landed at wharves in the Borough. The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, came into operation on 1st October, and amended and consolidated regulations previously issued. The Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers, &c.) Regulations, 1960, which also came into operation this year prescribe requirements to secure the hygienic handling of food at docks, cold stores and other premises previously excluded from the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. Codes of Practice were issued during the year jointly by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food covering the Hygienic Transport & Handling of Fish and Hygiene in the Retail Fish Trade. Similar Food Hygiene Codes of Practice for the Meat Trade were issued in 1959. A summary of the visits made by the Public Health Inspectors (Food) to food premises will be found on pages 70 and 71. Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs. Samples of food submitted for bacteriological examination numbered 4.00, consisting of 294 samples of desiccated coconut, 32 frozen whole hen egg powder, 22 ice cream, 20 tuberculin tested (pasteurised) milk, 11 pasteurised milk, 8 sterilised milk, 3 sausages, 3 watercress, 2 kangeroo steak (canned), 1 braised kangeroo tails (canned), 1 jellied eels, 1 frozen prawns, 1 chicken and ham paste and 1 trifle. All were found to be satisfactory with the exception of 7 samples of ice cream, referred to on page 38, and a sample of watercress which revealed the presence of B.coli (faecal), notification being sent to the local authority of the area in which the watercress was grown. 36 Basement Bakehouses. The fourth quinquennial examination of basement bakehouses took place in 1959, and as a result notice was given to the occupiers of the remaining five basement bakehouses in the Borough that the Certificates of Suitability issued with respect to the premises under the Factory & Workshop Act, 1901, would cease to have effect after 31st July, 1960. By that date all the bakehouses were closed with the exception of Nos. 3/5, Dock Street. The proprietors made several promises that they were about to move to new premises but finally, in December, they were summoned for using the bakehouse on two dates in October, the certificate of suitability having been withdrawn. They were fined £10 and ordered to pay £10 costs. Bakehouses and Bakers' Shops. Three summonses were issued against the proprietors of bakers' shops for selling bread containing foreign bodies. Fines of £50 with costs of £13.13s.0 were imposed. Cafes and Restaurants. An absolute discharge was given by the Magistrates to the proprietor of a cafe summoned under the Food Hygiene Regulations for having dirty and defective windows. Chemical Sampling of Foodstuffs. Samples submitted for analysis to the Public Analyst numbered 454 for the year. The Report of the Public Analyst appears on pages 50-52. An unusual specimen of food submitted to the Public Analyst for examination consisted of a sample taken from some sides of bacon which had been used in the course of a robbery to deaden the sound of explosives. Export Certificates. Fifty-two certificates were issued in respect of the examination of a variety of foodstuffs exported to the United States, South America, Canada, Sweden and Italy. The issue of these certificates necessitates inspection of the foodstuffs to be exported, and, on occasion, samples are taken for analysis before a certificate is issued. Where necessary, investigation is made into the method of production. Grocers Premises. The proprietor of a stall was summoned under the Labelling of Food Order for selling a packet of tea which did not bear the name and address of the packer. The Court granted an absolute discharge on payment of £1.1s.0 costs. 37 Ice Cream. Twenty-two samples of ice cream were subjected to the Methylene Blue reduction test, with the following results:- Manufactured Total in Borough: outside Borough Grade I - (2) 14 (8) 14 (10) " II 1 (-) - (-) 1 ( -) " III 1 (-) - (-) 1 ( -) " IV 6 (-) - (-) 6 ( -) (The figures in parenthesis are those for 1959). All the Grade III and Grade IV samples were manufactured by the same company. After two samples taken from retailers had proved to be unsatisfactory, investigations were carried out and further samples taken from the manufacturer) these also proved to be unsatisfactory but narrowed the field of investigation. The company was advised regarding methods of production and a further sample taken was Grade II. Manufacture was then discontinued for the winter but investigations will continue when the company resumes business. Although there are 28 premises in the Borough registered for the manufacture of Ice Cream, only three were used for this purpose during the year. These were inspected from time to time under the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, &c.) Regulations, 1959, and no contravention of the regulations was found. Legal Proceedings. Summonses dealt with by the Public Health Inspectors (Food) during the year, were as follows:- No. of Summonses Fines Costs Food and Drugs Act, 1959. 3 £50. 0. 0 £13. 13. 0 Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. 5 20. 0. 0 2. 0. 0 Labelling of Food Order, 1953. 1 - - - 1. 1. 0 Factories Act, 1937. 2 10. 0. 0 10. 0. 0 11 £80. 0. 0 £26. 14. 0 38 Cautionary Letters. On the instructions of the Public Health Committee, cautionary letters were sent in respect of the following contraventions :- Sterilised milk containing 2.3% added water. Absence of hot water supply for washing-up at a soft drinks stall. Milk Samples. Milk samples taken and submitted for chemical analysis during the year numbered 74, including seven taken at hospitals, schools and day nurseries in the Borough. The average fat and solids-not-fat content of milk samples analysed were as follows:- Fat Content Solids-not-Fat Content Channel Islands Milk. 4.50% 8.73% Other Milk. 3.60% 8.59% Poultry Stall. Fines of £20 and costs of £2 were imposed by the Court on the proprietor of a stall from which poultry was sold, for contraventions of the Food Hygiene Regulations and for which four summonses were issued. Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations. 1937-48. 241 Detention Notices and 424 Release Notices were served under the Regulations. These affected a variety of foodstuffs including cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, dried fruits, egg powder, ginger, gum arabic, horsemeat, assorted meats, mushrooms, nutmegs, offals, rabbits, sugar and tea. Consignments of frozen meats, offals, etc. which arrived unaccompanied by the official certificates, were either re-exported or subsequently released on production of the certificates. 299 carcases of mutton, representing a 5 per cent examination, were examined for caseous lymphadenitis by the cutting of the lymphatic nodes. All the carcases examined were found to be free from the disease. Unsound Food. The following quantities of unsound foodstuffs were disposed of during the year under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937-48, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 :- 39 Tons Wharves 76 London Fruit Exchange & Spitalfields Market 110 Bishopsgate Goods Station 8 Other Premises 126 Total:320 Tons Approximately 13 tons of unsound food was allowed to be used for animal feeding purposes, or for manufacturing purposes other than for human consumption, the remainder being delivered to, or collected by the Public Cleansing Department at whose riverside depot it was mixed with household refuse, under the supervision of the Public Cleansing Officer, and removed by barge to a controlled tipping site in Essex. Approximately 2,600 condemnation certificates in respect of unsound food were issued in 1960. Zeebrugge-Harwich Train Ferry. 302 midnight or early morning visits and 140 other visits were made to Bishopsgate Goods Station for the purpose of examining 8,445 trucks of foodstuffs arriving from the following countries:- Algeria 2 Trucks America 5 " Argentine 8 " Austria 1 " Australia 5 " Belgium 241 " Bulgaria 26 " Congo 49 " Ecuador 29 " France 8 " Germany 45 Trucks Hungary 424 " Italy 5,977 " Netherlands 5 " Poland 60 " Roumania 1 " Spain 7 " Switzerland 33 " Yugoslavia 1,519 " The weight of the foodstuffs examined was 127,158 tons, comprising 105,173 tons of fresh fruit and vegetables, 14,156 tons canned meats and sausages, etc., 4,320 tons bacon, 2,160 tons butter, 116 tons confectionery, 37 tons canned fruits and vegetables, 448 tons soups, 84 tons shell eggs, 61 tons fat backs, 442 tons horsemeat, 133 tons cheese and 28 tons of miscellaneous foodstuffs. Foodstuffs found to be unsound, and which were stopped and destroyed, amounted to approximately 8 tons. 40 Unsound Food. &c. - Complaints. Complaints made by members of the public as to the alleged unsound condition, etc. of food, and which were investigated during the year, numbered 34. The complaints referred to the following :- Alleged unsound condition: Apple pastry 4; Bread 1; Cheese 1; Crumpets 1; Doughnuts 1. Alleged dirty condition and/or foreign body or deposit: Bread 5; Cake 1; Corned Beef 1; Jam 1; Milk 4; Sausage l; Soft drink 1; Sweets 1; Bread and rolls 8. Alleged poor quality: Meat 1; Poultry 1.

PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Weather Conditions. January was mainly dry and sunny, and had sleet and snow on eight days. February was also sunny, but wet, with snow on four days. March was a dull month, rainy but not cold. April was sunny and very dry; May was warm with average sunshine and some rain, while June was sunny and dry. April, May and June were in fact the best months of the year, but from then onwards the weather deteriorated so that we had a wet summer. July and August were wet and cool and September very wet. November was sunny, but wet. December was an average month, with Christmas Eve cloudy and damp and Christmas Day mild and sunny in the afternoon. Boxing Day was wet and windy but mild. The Easter Bank Holiday week-end was cool and wet on Good Friday and Saturday, and mainly fine and sunny on Sunday and Monday. Whitsun week-end was warm and sunny on Saturday and Sunday with temperatures of 70-80°, but Whit-Monday was cloudy, with rain. August Bank Holiday week-end was cloudy and cool on Saturday, Sunday was fine and sunny and Monday cloudy, with thundery showers. The year was by no means as fine a one as 1959, but whilst it was often wet and dull there was no really cold month and the winter was not severe. We escaped with no fuel crisis and no painful experience of frozen pipes and burst roof tanks. On the whole the year was kind to the aged, who suffer in extreme cold, and free from those infections sometimes prevalent in hot summers. Notifications. The number of notified cases of infectious diseases (corrected for revised diagnosis and duplicate notifications) occurring during the year was 835, the lowest ever recorded; the number last year was 1,998. Table 17 on page 72 shows cases notified, together with comparative figures over the past ten years. A list of diseases notifiable in the County of London is shown in Table 20 on page 74. Cancer. The number of deaths from cancer of residents of the Borough occurring during the year was 213 (29 less than last year). Deaths from lung cancer numbered 53, which is 24 less than in 1959. The death rate from cancer of the lung in men increased to 855 per million population for England and Wales, or 36 per cent of all cancer deaths; whilst the number of lung cancer deaths expressed as percentage of deaths due to all forms of cancer in women was 7 per cent. 42 Diphtheria. Two notifications of Diphtheria were received during the year, one case being unconfirmed. The number of Stepney children immunised at London County Council clinics during the last five years, was as follows:- 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 Completed primary course:- Children under 5 years 1302 1330 1106 114.7 1761 " 5 to 15 " 437 318 420 415 439 Children given a secondary injection 1389 940 1372 1437 1563 Although only 7 cases of Diphtheria have been notified in the Borough during the last ten years, the necessity for immunisation is as pressing as ever. It is difficult to understand why, in spite of all the publicity given to the occasional outbreaks of diphtheria which occur and the local publicity campaigns urging protection by immunisation, the numbers immunised are not 100 per cent. Is it that parents are bewildered by the many different injections now available to children smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, tetanus, whooping cough, etc.? Sixty-one swabs were forwarded by general practitioners to the Mile End Group Laboratory, where bacteriological examinations are carried out on behalf of the Borough Council. Dysentery. There was an increase in the incidence of Sonne Dysentery, 140 cases being notified compared with 87 cases last year. The occurrence of Sonne Dysentery is common but seldom fatal, and then only in aged persons or debilitated children. Enteric Fever. One case of Enteric Fever was notified during the year. Erysipelas. During the year five notifications were received (compared with 119 in 1936). Food Poisoning. There were 26 cases of food poisoning in the Borough during the year, 19 being notified cases and 7 otherwise ascertained. Salmonella organisms were isolated in 11 cases. 43 Malaria. No cases of Malaria were notified during the year. Measles. Notifications of Measles in the Borough numbered 55.- compared with 1,344 last year. There were no deaths from the disease. Epidemics tend to recur at intervals of just under two years. Meningococcal Infection. There were two notifications during the year, the same number as last year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Two cases were notified during the year, neither being residents of the Borough. Poliomyelitis. Two notifications of Poliomyelitis were received (one paralytic and the other non-paralytic), the diagnosis not being confirmed in the non-paralytic case. Vaccination against Poliomyelitis is carried out by the Divisional Health Department of the London County Council. Provision was first made for young children, young persons and expectant mothers, a primary and secondary injection being given in each case. Vaccination is now available to all persons up to the age of 40 years. Puerperal Pyrexia. There were 106 notifications during the year compared with 58 in 1959. Of these, 46 were residents of the Borough. Scabies. Scabies is still notifiable under the County of London (Scabies) Regulations, 1943. The number of cases formally notified was 61 compared with 49 last year. Ninety scabies patients and contacts were treated by medicinal baths at Branch Road Treatment Centre and their clothing disinfested, viz:- Males 40 Females 34 Children 16 The number of baths given during the year totalled 124. 44 PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS - 1935 • 1960 DEATH RATE PER 100,000 POPULATION - RED NOTIFICATION RATE PER 100,000 POPULATION - BLACK Scarlet Fever. There were 24, cases notified and no deaths from the disease. Smallpox. No cases of Smallpox were notified during the year and it was not necessary to take action under the Public Health (Smallpox) Regulations, 1917. Frequent notifications are received from Port and Airport authorities of persons coming into the Borough who may have been in contact with smallpox. Observation for the necessary period is kept on such persons by officers of the Public Health Department. The number of children successfully vaccinated or re-vaccinated against smallpox at London County Council clinics, during the year, was 724. Tuberculosis. The number of primary notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis received was 110 compared with 135 last year, and the number of nonpulmonary cases notified was 14 compared with nine the previous year. The mortality rate for the year for pulmonary tuberculosis was 8 and for non-pulmonary nil per 100,000 population, compared with 17 and nil respectively for 1959. (For details of register and notifications see page 73.) The pulmonary tuberculosis mortality rate for the whole country is 68 per million persons compared with Stepney's rate of 85 per million. Since 1950 the death rate for England and Wales has fallen by 79 per cent, the comparable figure for Stepney being 84. per cent. A graph showing notification rates and death rates of pulmonary tuberculosis per 100,000 population over the past 25 years is given opposite previous page. Eighty-seven visits were paid by the Public Health Inspectors to the homes of persons suffering from tuberculosis and appropriate action taken where public health nuisances were found to exist. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations. 1925. These Regulations provide that persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract shall not be employed in the handling of milk or milk receptacles. Power is given to the Council to cause such persons to discontinue their employment. It was not found necessary during the year to take action under the Regulations. 45 Mass X-Ray Campaign, 10th October to 4th November. For the past fifteen years or so mass radiography has played an important part in the control of tuberculosis and in the discovery of other abnormalities of the lungs, including cancer conditions. For several years, a Mass X-Ray Unit of the North-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board has visited the Borough from time to time X-raying members of the public, factory employees and other groups of people. Lately, in order no doubt to ensure that the best possible use is made of the Units, intensive local surveys have been carried out in various parts of the country, notably Glasgow, Liverpool and Exeter. A similar intensive survey was carried out, for the first time in London, in this Borough from 10th October to 4th November this year. The preparation and organisation of the campaign which extended over several months was carried out jointly by the staffs of the four Mobile Units employed and the Public Health Department. The Borough Council readily agreed to authorise the expenditure necessary to augment that of the Regional Hospital Board in promoting an intensive publicity campaign. Posters were displayed on sites large and small throughout the Borough; a loudspeaker van toured the area, and leaflets were delivered to every household. The Press, local and national, were most co-operative in giving publicity to the campaign, and the British Broadcasting Company featured the campaign several times in radio and television programmes. The proprietors of local shops and businesses generously donated 80 prizes for use in a novel Lucky X-Ray Number publicity effort. Her Worship the Mayor devoted much of her time to visiting each of the Units and several celebrities of stage, screen and radio attended to be X-rayed and to present the prizes. In spite of all our efforts, however, the result so far as the number of persons X-rayed was concerned can be said to be rather disappointing. 17,823 persons were X-rayed, not all, by any means, being residents of Stepney. The Borough's estimated resident population over the age of 15 is 73,300, whilst the estimated daytime population of adults is 115,300. The number of clinically significant cases of tuberculosis revealed so far by the survey is 4.0, or 2.2 persons per 1,000 X-rayed. Did the end justify the means? The purist might say that the time, energy and expense devoted to such a campaign would be well justified if only a single case of tuberculosis were discovered. By this yardstick the campaign was a resounding success, but nevertheless one is left with the feeling that it is a pity the public is so apathetic towards the efforts expended to safeguard their health in a campaign of this nature. Final results of the campaign are not yet available as there are 22 cases still to be diagnosed. Of the 40 cases requiring immediate treatment or close clinic supervision 31 were males. In addition 32 cases require occasional clinic supervision. Nine cases of lung cancer were discovered, and 54 other abnormalities. Stepney residents accounted for 27 of the 40 significant cases of lung tuberculosis. 46 MASS X-RAY CAMPAIGN Mr. David Kossoff at the Mobile Unit on Tower Hill. Halifax Photos Mr. Bernard Bresslaw at the Mobile Unit at Odeon Cinema, Mile End Road Halifax Photos Tuberculosis Care Committee. The Tuberculosis Care Committee on which are represented voluntary and official bodies, and whose meetings are attended by the Medical Officer of Health, continues to supply help to tuberculous persons and to relatives who require assistance which cannot be obtained from official sources or where urgency or special circumstances indicate that the voluntary sources of the Care Committee are preferable. Although tuberculosis is slowly but surely being conquered, the public should realise that much help is still needed to be given to persons suffering from the disease. During the year help was given to needy persons by way of clothing, fuel, furnishings, grants towards debts and fares to relatives visiting patients in sanatoria. The Caro Committee again provided a day's coach outing to the sea for 23 patients and Christmas gifts to 50 patients. Recuperative holidays were arranged for 19 patients and at the end of the year 87 patients were in receipt of extra nourishment through the London County Council's Scheme. The Annual Christmas Seal Sale Fund amounted to £185 and this was supplemented by donations from various organisations, for which the Care Committee is most grateful. Where possible grants were obtained from statutory and voluntary funds, but where these could not be obtained the funds of the Committee were used. Help was also obtained from appropriate sources for patients attending the Chest Clinic and suffering from chronic bronchitis or lung cancer. The number of these patients is increasing and many are in need of help and advice. Whooning Cough. Cases notified during the year numbered 223, the figure for 1959 being 76. There were no deaths from the disease. Infectious Disease Contacts. Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with an infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was found necessary to issue one such certificate during the year. 47 Authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. A parson proceeding abroad is required in certain countries to produce a certificate of recent successful vaccination and inoculation, and, in addition, the signature of the vaccinating doctor must be verified by the Medical Officer of Health of the district. During the year, the signatures on 589 certificates were verified as those of medical practitioners practising in Stepney and the certificates endorsed accordingly. Disinfection. Premises disinfected because of infectious disease numbered 19, which included five for pulmonary tuberculosis. 3,597 articles of clothing and bedding were steam disinfected, including 714 articles for export for which nine certificates were issued. Formaldehyde disinfection of 189,686 articles of clothing, 80 tons of boots and 4 tons of rags all for export was also carried out during the year, for which 211 certificates were issued. The charges for export and other disinfections carried out amounted to £113. Disinfestation (bed bugs and other insect pests). The following is a summary of insect disinfestation work carried out by the Public Health Inspector (Disinfestation):- General inspection for vermin 1,327 Attempted visits 191 No. of premises found verminous 676 " re-visits 115 11 miscellaneous visits 205 " Rooms sprayed 1,587 " Premises sprayed 664 In addition, disinfestation was carried out on 103 occasions of the furniture and effects of families rehoused by the London County Council. Treatments were also carried out for infestations of cockroaches, beetles, ants, silverfish, and the like. The Council continues to carry out, on behalf of the Stepney Group Hospital Management Committee, any necessary work of disinfestation at hospitals and other premises in the Borough coming within the control of that Committee. 48 Verminous Persons. The number of lice-infested persons bathed and whose clothing was disinfested at the Council's Cleansing Station, was as follows Hales 171 Females 16 Children 2 Total: 189 The number of baths and treatments given amounted to 202. 49 SUMMARY OF PUBLIC ANALYST'S QUARTERLY REPORTS for the year 1960. The following is a summary of the reports submitted each quarter of the year, in compliance with Section 99 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, by the Council's Public Analyst, Mr.D.F.H.
