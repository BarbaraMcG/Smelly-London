AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1961, which includes the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. Several changes of Staff have taken place in the Department since my last report. Mr, G-. Holmes resigned his post as Chief Public Health Inspector on being appointed Chief Public Health Inspector and Cleansing Superintendent to the Borough of Chingford, and was succeeded by the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. R. Roper. Mr. D. Lloyd Jones, District Public Health Inspector, resigned on being appointed Divisional Inspector to the County Borough of Cardiff, and was replaced by Mr. T.E.R. Jones. Mrs. Eagle stone resigned from the Clerical Staff for domestic reasons, and was replaced by Miss J. Richards. Mrs. B. Voak was appointed with effect from 1st February, 1962, as an additional (Junior) Clerk to the Department. Finally, Mr. J.A. Orrell was appointed Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Roper's appointment and commenced his duties on 1st May, 1962. VITAL STATISTICS. There has been no significant change in the birth rate, and a small increase in the death rate, as compared with the previous year. There were more deaths from cancer of the lung, bronchus and stomach, and from coronary and other circulatory di3e,ases. Health education and propaganda in the coming year are therefore being directed towards preventive measures against these diseases. Motor vehicle accidents accounted for eight deaths and there were ten other accidental deaths. At least two of these (due to bleeding from a cut and choking by a swallowoddenture, respectively) might have been averted if prompt and efficient first-aid had been available at the time. Efforts to assess the extent and nature of non-fatal home accidents met with little success, as very few doctors or hospitals have time to supply details; also those concerned are not always willing that injuries for which some blame might be attached should be reported to anyone not actually concerned with the treatment. From the little information I have been able to obtain by courtesy of local doctors, it would appear that nearly all domestic accidents which are not fatal are in fact quite trivial, and due to careless and clumsy behaviour. The cold spell at the end of the year caused at least one local lady to fall on an icy step, and I would make a plea -3- /for for occupiers to sprinkle sand or ashes when ice forms on the approaches to their premises, and on those of elderly or disabled neighbours. Publicity during the year was concentrated on the prevention of injury by fire and by accidental poisoning. Doctors, chemists and public libraries co-operated well by allowing posters and leaflets to be displayed on their premises. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. An outbreak, of measles, and a number of cases of a mild form of infective diarrhoea occurred during the year. Tuberculosis notifications (18) were the lowest on record, and it is gratifying to note the reduction in the number of cases of this disease notified in the District during the past 10 years, despite the increase of population, viz:- Notifications: Respiratory Non-Respiratory Total 1952 52 4 56 1953 57 5 62 1954 44 4 48 1955 32 2 34 1956 40 6 46 1957 32 4 36 1958 18 4 22 1959 33 0 33 I960 29 2 31 1961 16 2 18 This satisfactory progress may be attributed to- 1) Early case finding and control of infectious persons. 2) Supervision of contacts. 3) B.C.G. vaccination. 4) Mass X-ray. 5) Improved living standards. 6) Elimination of tuberculosis from dairy herds. If the present policy is faithfully pursued, the total eradication of tuberculosis from the community within the next few years is a distinct possibility, provided that new importations can be prevented by a rigid system of immigration control. /Three 4 Three children contracted poliomyelitis, two of whom made a complete recovery, and the other remains moderately disabled. ESSEX COUNTY COUNCIL ACT, 1952, SECTION 99, AND PUBLIC HEALTH (INFECTIOUS DISEASES) REGULATIONS, 1953. One person was required and three persons were requested to suspend their employment as food handlers under the appropriate Act and Regulations, with a view to preventing the risk of spreading of food-borne infections. All were informed of the compensation provisions, and in two cases, claims amounting to £2.11.0d., and £6.18.Od., respectively, were received and duly met by the Council. SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT. 1951. Of the four cases kept under observation during the year, two were admitted to hospital, where one died; one was admitted to Part III Accommodation; the remaining case is being kept under observation at home. NEW LEGISLATION. The following new legislation affecting the work of the Department became operative during the year:- Consumers' Protection Act, 1961. Factories (Cleanliness of Walls and Ceilings) Order, 1960. Housing Act, 1961. Public Health Act, 1961. Skimmed Milk with Non-Milk Fat Regulations, 1960. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and co-operation during the year, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Educational Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made. H.

L.C.C. Debden Estate 6 - Old Loughton 3 - L.C.C. Hainault Estate 4 - Chigwell (excl. L.C.C. Estate) 1 - Buckhurst Hill 2 2 16 2 Tuberculosis case finding among school entrants. The purpose of this scheme which, with slight variations, has operated in the Forest Division since 1954, is to trace, by applying a simple skin test to a five year old child, the source of a tuberculous infection in the child's family, or contacts, who may not be aware of the condition. Parents are invited to give their consent to their child having this skin test which has now come to be regarded as part of the child's first routine medical inspection at school, and the response is usually in the region of 70%. The results obtained in this District are set cut below:- Number to whom offered: 881 Number tested and percentage: 594 (67.4) Positive re-actors- Total number: 7 Known contacts: 3 New cases: 4 The new positive cases were notified to the Chest Physicians who investigated each case. Where necessary, members of the child's family, relatives and other family contacts were called for examination and I am pleased to report that in no instance was anything of serious significance discovered. /Vaccination -9- Vaccination and Immunisation Schemes: 1. Tuberculosis (B.C.G.). The Forest Divisional School Medical Officer reports:- "About twelve years ago, the Tuberculosis Research Unit of the Medical Research Council commenced extensive trials to test the efficacy of B.C.G. vaccine. The participants selected for this national survey were children who were in their last year at school and could be followed up for at least six years after leaving school. All were volunteeers. In fact the trials went on for ten years and a preliminary report issued at the end of this period stated that it had been proved conclusively that vaccination with B.C.G. gave a considerable degree of protection for at least six and a half years. Therefore, a child vaccinated at school during his fourteenth year received protection over the years when most susceptible to the disease of tuberculosis. It is, therefore, gratifying to report a small increase (about 4%) in the number of pupils in the 13-14 age group, attending schools in the Forest Division who received this vaccination this year," The table below shows the results for the Chigwell Urban District:- Number of school children to whom B.C.G. Vaccination was offered: 1,571 Number accepted: 1,183 (75.3%) Number given skin test and percentage: 1,086 (69,1%) Number who gave positive re-action to skin test: 72 Number who received B.C.G.: 924 All the pupils who gave a positive re-action to the skin test were referred to the Chest Clinic for investigation but in no instance was anything of si nificance discovered. 2. Smallpox. 699 primary vaccinabions were performed and 207 persons were re-vaccinated during the year, 3. Diphtheria. 990 completed a course of diphtheria immunisation during the year. 1,017 re-inforcing injections were also administered. -10- /4. Wooping Cough. 363 children completed a course of immunisation against whooping cough. 5. Poliomyelitis. 994 children completed a course of immunisation against poliomyelitis. Young persons (15 - 25 years) 338 Adults (26-40 years) 1,158 Third injections 2,642 Fourth " 3,148 -11- GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE DISTRICT.

To the Chairman and Members of the Chigwell Urban. District Council. MADAM CHAIRMAN, AND GENTLEMEN, I have, pleasure, in presenting the Annual Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. I am indebted to the Engineer and Surveyor, Mr. R. W. Edwards, A.M.I.C.E.,M.I.Mun.E., for providing the information, on pages 18 and. 19 regarding rivers and streams, drainage, sewerage and public cleansing, also to Mr. H. E. Bywater, M.R.C.V.S.,F.R.S.E., for his report on riding establishments on. pages 32 and 33. R. ROPER, F.R.S.H.,M.A.P.H.I. Chief Public Health Inspector. June, 1962. -16- SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. 1. WATER, The water supply in the area is, except for one shallow well and one deep well, provided "by the Metropolitan Water Board, it is a piped. supply and is found to be satisfactory both in quantity and quality. The supply from the shallow well was examined and found to be unsatisfactory by reason of excremental contanimation, the use of this well has been discontinued and an alternative supply of mains water has been provided. Samples of the supply from the deep well have been examined and were found to be satisfactory. The number of houses in the area is 17,901 and the estimated population is 61,640. 2. SWIMMING- BATHS. The district has one swimming pool open to the Public, this is situated at Grange Farm, Chigwell and is controlled by the London Parochial Charities, it is used to its full capacity during the summer season, but is inadequate to serve the needs of the whole district. Additionally there is a private swimming pool at the Girl Guides' Camping ground at Lambourne Road, Chigwell and four pools situated im schools. All these pools are supplied with water from the Metropolitan Boards;' mains supply and periodic tests have been carried out to ensure the maintenance of the water to the required standard of cleanliness. 3. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The River Roding flows through the centre of the District dividing the Ward of Chigwell on the south-east from those of Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods, in the river area within this District which is under the jurisdiction of the Essex River Board. Some flooding of fields in the valley occurs during the exceptionally heavy winter rains. /4. -17- 4. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The soil drainage from the greater part of the District gravitates to the main disposal works at Luxborough Lane which were improved in 1938> extended after the war and are now nearing the end of a further stage of improvement, although the constant inorease in the number of dwellings in the District is making yet further work inevitable. The four additional primary sludge digesters are almost complete and with the new detritus tanks should be in operation in the autumn. Improved effluent treatment area and storm water facilities are now to be undertaken, A smaller part of the District drains to the Millers Lane Sewage Disposal Works and the Council sees the need for improvement there, and has oalled for a report on this matter. The completion of improvements at both Works is expected to result in a higher standard of purity in the effluent to be discharged to the River Roding, As regards sewerage, the Council is faced not only with the increasing flows from new development but also with some ageing and unsatisfactory sewers. Present proposals envisage new sewerage in both the north and south parts of Loughton, A small area of Buckhurst Hill drains into the sewers of Wanstead and Woodford, thence via Chingford and to the East Middlesex Scheme, Most of the Hainault Estate drains to the sewers of Dagenham District and the Works of that Authority, using sewers in Ilford en route. There are four outlying pumping stations lifting the flow from low lying areas up tc the main gravity sewers. The four stations include the new one at Roding Road and the newly enlarged one at Bradwell Road which is about to be handed over by the Contractor, Generally, there is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist, /5. -18- 5. CLOSET ACCOMMODATION AND CESSPOOLS. Such premises as have earth closets, chemical closets or cesspools are situated in areas which have no sewer available for drainage connections. Extension of the sewerage system is progressing and connections are being made as these extensions permit. Number of Cesspools and Septic Tanks: Buckhurst Hill 1 Chigwell 88 Loughton 14 6. PUBLIC CLEANSING-. Domestic refuse is being collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and labour. A fleet of seven compressing type refuse collection vehicles is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a service of removing bulky articles (e.g. mattresses, bedsteads etc.) on request from householders. This free service cannot be stressed too much as it is provided to combat the other alternative of tipping old mattresses etc. into ditches or on to Forest land. Trade refuse is also collected, a charge related to actual cost being made only for refuse the character of which is clearly not domestic. Refuse is at present disposed of by controlled tipping at a tip provided by the contractor. Payment of the firm is per load and includes levelling, compacting and covering, a bulldozer and the covering material being provided in the price. The area exposed at any one time is kept to a low minimum and measures are taken against fliea and vermin as necessary from time to time. This tip will be filled during the near future and the Council has just received a short term planning consent for controlled tipping by the Council on another site. Long term arrangements for refuse disposal will have to be made during the next few years. Salvage of paper and rags continues to produce sales during the year but at present the paper market is not good. Nevertheless the Council proposes to modernise the paper salvage arrangements now that this work has been transferred to the Depot at Rectory Lane, Loughton. Road gullies in adopted District roads are emptied (and re-sealed with clean water) by machine three times during the year by contract. If the Council takes over County Roads, there will be a great increase in the number of gullies tc be done in future years. -19- /7 7. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA.

OUTWORKERS. 102 visits paid to the outworkers in the district. A - 31 - RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT. 1959. The annual report of' the Council13 Veterinary Officer, Mr. H.E. Bywater, is as follows:- "I have pleasure in submitting my report of the quarterly inspections of riding establishments in your area made during the year ended 31st December, 1961. In accordance with my usual practice the inspections were made at irregular intervals and times during the four quarters of the year, in order that they might be made without prior knowledge of the owners of the premises. In general, conditions were reasonably satisfactory and no actual contraventions of the Act were npted at any of the visits. The horses tend to have periods when they are not worked daily whilst there are other periods, as at fteek-enda and public and school holidays, when the horses are worked for long periods, and at such times consideration has to be given to the matter Of over-working. No cases of obvious illtreatment, however, were noted. Since the inspections are' spaced atfkirly long intervals, it would assist if the public would notify any matters which warrant special investigation. It is not suggested that more frequent official inspections are necessary, but obviously, unless one is present at all times, there may well be undesirable practices which need to be checked and this- can- only be accomplished by the help of the public. Below is given a list of the Riding Establishments, with the name of the owner or person in charge and the average number of animals inspected:- Nightingale Riding School, Buckhurst Hill. Mr. T.
