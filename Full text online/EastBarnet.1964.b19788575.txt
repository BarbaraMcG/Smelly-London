AC 4421(3) II A102 EBAR 26 NINETY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1964 by C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S.(Eng.), L.R.C.P.(Lond.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council together with the ANNUAL REPORT of W. K. PICKUP, M.R.s .H. Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council NINETY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1964 by C. M. SCOTT, M.R.C.S.(Eng ), L.R.C.P.(Lond.) Medical Officer of Health to the Council together with the ANNUAL REPORT of W. K. PICKUP, M.R.S.H. Chief Public Health Inspector East Barnet Urban District Council East Barnet Urban District Council NINETY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1964 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council As this Annual Report will be the last to be presented to the East Barnet Urban District Council, and as the unavailablity of full figures for 1964 makes it difficult to present the usual vital statistics, it seems appropriate to take a brief look at the public health aspect of the District's life as an entity of local government. Unfortunately, our records are not complete. It has, in fact, been impossible to trace from any source the Annual Reports for the first 16 years and we, therefore, start from 1891, in which year Dr. Walter Roughton was appointed Medical Officer of Health. It is true that the Council minutes show that in 1875 the then East Barnet Local Board appointed a Dr. Saunders as a part time Medical Officer of Health, for which he was paid £5 per annum which was intended also to cover " travel, expenses, stationery, postage, etc.". The only reasonable comment is that this was in the days of the penny post. Dr. Saunders, nevertheless, held the appointment for 13 years until his resignation in March, 1888. His successor, Dr. T. W. Thompson, accepted a temporary appointment on the same princely terms and retained the post for 2 years. And now back to Dr. W. Roughton, who took office in May, 1891, on a yearly basis at a salary of £50 per annum. Dr. Roughton was a remarkable character. He held office from 1891 until 1917 and when I came to this district in 1924, he was still living in a nearby area and was well remembered by all the local doctors. He was in fact the father-in-law of a well remembered General Practitioner who retired just prior to the 1939 War. He took a great interest in infectious diseases and for many years stressed the necessity of a local Isolation Hospital—his suggestion being that a small house should be furnished Page Three for the reception of 5 or 6 patients with a man and wife as caretakers. It was felt that a nurse could be obtained from London if and when a patient was admitted. The disinfection of articles was to be carried out at Hornsey, but as Dr. Roughton pointed out "this method is necessarily very unsatisfactory, for it entails a great deal of trouble, inconvenience, and expense, and being purely an act of grace, is liable to cease at any moment It should be remembered that at this time the isolation of sick children from school and the removal of people to an Isolation Hospital was not the practice. Children were being sent to school whilst suffering from Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria and one report states that in 1893 a child known to be one of the first cases of an outbreak of Scarlet Fever was found to be mixing widely with other children during the period of desquamation, a condition at that time thought to be highly infectious. As these notes are not intended to be other than a brief sketch it is not desirable to give details of the progress of Public Health Legislation, but it should be said that Dr. Roughton was in the van of those clamouring for legislation for the enforcement of controls to lessen the incidence of infectious diseases. After many years of hammering at the Council, Dr. Roughton finally succeeded in getting his way and in 1900 negotiations commenced to provide an Isolation Hospital. In one report he stated "as some members of the Council have, at different times, talked vaguely of sending such cases to the Fever Hospital, I wrote to every Fever Hospital on the north side of London enquiring if they would admit patients from this district. In every case I was met with a refusal and was told, in effect, that we must look after our own. This was just the kind of answer I had anticipated ". In 1902, 3 cases of Smallpox occurred in East Barnet and 2 cottages at the sewage farm were converted into a temporary Isolation Hospital. It was not in fact used, as of the 3 cases, the first died, the second made his own way delirious to South Mimms Smallpox Hospital, to which the third case was removed. There was a further case in 1930, since when no further cases have occurred in the district. Finally, in 1909, the Isolation Hospital in Mays Lane (now known as St. Stephen's Hospital) was opened and in that year 22 Scarlet Fever cases and 10 Diphtheria cases were admitted. At first, the Hospital was not very popular, lacking heating and modern amenities, but before it finally ceased to function in 1949, it had become a very valuable asset to the district. It is interesting to note that the Councillors of East Barnet provided many Chairmen of the Isolation Hospital Committee (a joint Committee of Barnet Urban, Barnet Rural and East Barnet). In fact, your present Medical Officer of Health was one of the last to hold office. Preventive medicine has, of course, always been the main aim of Public Health and in closing the section on Infectious Diseases, two examples of the success of recent years should be quoted. Page Four 1. Poliomyelitis—8 cases in 1950 and none since 1958. 2. Diphtheria—from 1895-1935 a steady average of 12-15 cases yearly (with two peaks of 29 and 37 in 1905 and 1930 respectively). One case in 1945 and none since, despite the large increase in population from 6,298 in 1885 to 13,240 in 1910, 23,950 in 1935 and 40,710 in 1955. It was in 1900 that bacterial filter beds were constructed at the sewage farm and the whole of the district was on constant water supply by 1907. Since then analyses of the water supply have been consistently good. No records are available for the period 1911-1916, and in 1917 Dr. W. H. Elam followed Dr. Roughton. He held office until his death in 1923, when my immediate predecessor Dr.Æ. Rose was appointed. 1918 was the influenza year and East Barnet sustained 30 deaths— a high proportion of a total number of deaths in that year of 125. As an example of the change in the character of the district, it should be mentioned that in the mid-20's there were 10 farms registered in the district. Strange to say there is still one. There were also 5 slaughterhouses, now luckily none. Our Public Health Inspectors benefit by the absence of evening and weekend visits necessary if there are slaughterhouses, but their time has been amply filled with other duties. In the early 1930's, the pasteurisation of milk was the chief concern of the Public Health Department and it is estimated that 6-7% of distributed milk was infected with tubercle bacilli. The total number of new cases of tubercular infection in 1930 was 26 in a population of 19,350, compared with 9 cases in 1963, with a population of 41,000. During the War years, Scabies became a public health problem and a clinic set up at Church Farm dealt with about 500 cases per annum. By 1952, Scabies had been treated "out of existence" and is now a very uncommon infection, at least in an area of this type. Since the War, housing has become of prime importance to the Department and in 1955 a Housing Survey of the district was undertaken. Following this survey, clearance area work formed a considerable part of the Department's duties until, in fact, the Clearance Area programme was completed in 1963. There is, of course, constant work being done in the treatment of individual unfit houses—work which will always remain a necessity. In 1954 the Council became a Food and Drugs and Shops Act Authority. The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, came into operation at the beginning of 1956 and with the coming into force of the Food Hygiene Regulations, a very large number of visits have been made annually in connection with food hygiene. A high standard is now prevalent throughout the district. Since the Clean Air Act of 1956, each year has seen further Page Five sions of smoke control areas and now a large part of the district has been covered. This has, of course, entailed a large amount of extra work. This somewhat discursive report must now draw to a close. I am conscious there are many omissions. Had time permitted I would have liked to have covered far more ground but this sketch may at least convey a picture of the district as seen by the Public Health Department. My own term of office has been since 1940 and since the appointment had to come to an end with the Greater London Reorganisation, I am at least certain of the distinction that I shall be the last Medical Officer of Health of East Barnet. I can, with considerable pride, claim that the efforts of the Public Health Department have played their part in the certainty of the future of a healthy district despite the fact that we still have too large a number of sub-standard houses and too much overcrowding. May I finally pay very sincere tributes to all my staff, Mr. Pickup, the Chief Public Health Inspector, the other Public Health Inspectors and the clerical staff. All have worked consistently well and have formed a very loyal and hard working team. As regards these notes, they could never have been written without the research and work of the Student Public Health Inspector, Mark Williams, to whom my very special thanks. East Barnet can go forward into the new borough with head held high and will, I am confident, continue to play a prominent part in protecting the health of the Borough of Barnet, and as sure of the backing of the new Borough Council as the Department has always been of the now dying East Barnet Urban District Council.

During the year several hundred such certificates were authenticated and marked with the authorised stamp. LABORATORY FACILITIES These facilities are provided by the Central Public Health Laboratory Service. The Service has been of the greatest assistance to the Department through its laboratories at Colindale and at Coppetts Wood Hospital. This assistance, and the close co-operation which has continued for so many years between my Department and the Laboratory Service is gratefully acknowledged. INFECTIOUS DISEASES Table I, which gives the number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified in 1964, shows a total of 256 such cases. The diseases which make up the greater number of cases notified are the ailments of childhood and vary greatly year by year. SPECIAL HOUSING CASES During 1964, 34 families were referred to the department for special consideration for Council housing accommodation on medical grounds. This was 9 fewer than in 1963. All the families were visited, and after consideration of the reports received from the Inspector visiting the homes and the medical certificates or letter submitted with applications, 7 of the families were recommended to the Housing Committee as being in need of more suitable accommodation. By the end of the year it had been possible to rehouse 1 of these families, together with 12 families whose applications were approved in 1962. In addition, 2 families whose applications had been approved, found more suitable accommodation on their own initiative. There has once again been a demand for accommodation in Vale Court, Bulwer Road, New Barnet. This particular scheme, which provides homes for 18 elderly women, has proved very successful, and there would appear to be a very urgent need for more accommodation of this type. Once again I would like to record my appreciation of the help given by the Housing Manager and his deputy in dealing with recommended cases. Page Nine East Barnet Urban District Council REPORT of the CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1964 To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council I have the honour to present this, my thirteenth and last annual report, to the Council. With the commencement of a new inspector on the 1st January, the department was for the first time in 6 months at full establishment. The report is set out in its usual pattern, the tables giving in detail the work of the department. These tables are commented upon in the body of the report. For the past few years, housing held a major place in the department's activities and this work has now been considerably reduced as the programme has been completed. Clean Air, however, still continues to absorb a considerable amount of time and the Council's programme for the establishment of Smoke Control Areas, which it was intended would cover the whole of the district by 1971, proceeded to schedule. In 1954 this Council became a Food and Drugs Authority. The main purpose of the original Food and Drugs Act, 1875, was to prevent the gross adulteration of foods and drugs sold at that time, and in those days at least 20% of samples submitted for analysis were found to be adulterated. Today, the national average of unsatisfactory samples is something under 5%. The excessive adulteration of those early days has given way to the more insidious means of deception, such as mis-description and over-exaggerated claims on labels and in advertisements. Whilst it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings for false labelling, the department has taken informal action in a number of cases and in every instance, proper labelling resulted. The Noise Abatement Act, which I mentioned in the last report, has, as forecast, resulted in an increase in the number of complaints. The majority of complaints could not be classed as statutory nuisances. However, occasionally a complaint of noise is close to being a Page Ten tory nuisance and in these cases when the owners of the premises concerned have been approached, co-operation has been received. The latest new heading in the report is, Offices, Shops and Railway Premises. To date the only action to have been taken is the registering of premises to which this new Act applies. Undoubtedly in the future a considerable amount of time will be spent in the administration of this legislation. Naturally I regret the end of a very pleasant association both with the Council and the Officers, and whilst the break with East Barnet as a Council is inevitable, I trust I shall be able to continue to serve the district over a wider area in the new Borough. In conclusion I would, for the last time, express my thanks to every member, both past and present, of the Public Health Department for their support during my time as Chief Public Health Inspector. In particular I must thank Mr. Smith, my Deputy, for his efforts and assistance during the period of my appointment and especially for the time he has spent in organising and controlling a very efficient Food and Drugs Section. I also wish to thank all other Officers of the Council for their assistance and co-operation W. K.

The figures are set out under various sub-headings and the figures for 1963 are given for a purpose of comparison. The total number of visits shows a slight decrease over the previous year. The figures do not show any variation which cannot be accounted for by the normal difference in the amount of work under various headings. Nuisances and Sanitary Defects In this section there has been a small increase in the number of visits. These visits are those made following a complaint by a member of the public and visits made in following up such complaints to ascertain whether the conditions giving rise to the complaint have been remedied. These visits are closely related to the number of complaints received. Every complaint received, including anonymous complaints, means at least one visit. In the case of many of the complaints received the Inspector can only give advice, but where contraventions of the Public Health Act, 1936, or other Acts are concerned the necessary Page Fifteen notices for the remedying of the complaint are served on the owner or occupier as the case may be. The number of preliminary notices served during the year shows an increase of ten. Table II of the . report gives the number of notices served both in 1963 and 1964 and the results of the service of those notices. The relationship betwen the number of notices and complaints seems to vary widely year by year and is mainly due to the cause of the complaint. Table III which lists the repairs carried out as a result of notices served on owners has remained approximately the same as the previous year. Infectious Diseases and Food Poisoning The number of visits made under this heading during the year is 213. This figure shows a decrease of 182 on the previous year due to the incidence of infectious disease having considerably reduced. Verminous Premises Eight visits were made during the year regarding verminous premises. Schools, Brooks and Streams, Hairdressers' and Barbers' Premises These are routine inspections and do not vary by any extent year by year. HOUSING Clearance Areas There were, at the beginning of 1964, 4 confirmed clearance areas affecting 11 houses which had not been demolished. None of these areas had been demolished at the end of the year and during the period under review the Medical Officer of Health did not represent to the Council any new clearance areas. Demolition Orders and Closing Orders At the beginning of 1964 there were 2 houses on which demolition orders had been served and the premises not demolished, and 10 houses on which closing orders were in force. The houses on which closing orders were outstanding were 20 and 22 Lancasted Road, and those on which closing orders were operative were: 51a, 90, 96 and 101 East Barnet Road. 7 Victoria Road. 12, 16 and 18 Victoria Avenue, and 120 and 131 Lancaster Road. During 1964 the closing orders on 90 and 101 East Barnet Road, 12, 16 and 18 Victoria Avenue, and 120 and 131 Lancaster Road were determined. There were no clearance or demolition orders made during the year. As may be seen by Table III, a considerable amount of work of repair was carried out by owners after the service of statutory and intimation notices. Page Sixteen FOOD HYGIENE During the year 1,901 visits were made to various food premises in the district. Some types of premises are visited more frequently than others and this fact is reflected in the figures for restaurants, snack bars and butchers' shops. The improvement in food hygiene noted in my recent reports has continued during the year though several cases have been brought to the notice of the Department where foodstuffs have been sold in an unsatisfactory condition due to the staffs of the shops concerned failing to observe the elementary rules of stock rotation. In one case the sale of three apple turnovers, in two of which the apple filling was mouldy, resulted at subsequent Court proceedings in the baker concerned being fined £25 with £15 15s. Od. costs. Seven other summonses heard at the same time relating to breaches of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations on the same premises resulted in further fines totalling £140 with 21 gns. costs. It is gratifying to note that a number of food shops are displaying notices requesting customers to refrain from smoking, a practice I would like to see universally adopted. Although it is some years since they were first introduced shopkeepers continue to ask for notices prepared by the Department and supplied free of charge, requesting the public not to take dogs into food shops. The canine population of the district appears to be on the increase but it is satisfactory to observe that where a few years ago shopkeepers were hesitant to display notices, fearing, it is presumed, that they might offend potential customers, the majority are now only too willing to do so. MILK LICENCES Five applications were received for a Dealer's (Pre-Packed Milk) Licence under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963. Under these Regulations supplementary licences are no longer necessary TYPES OF FOOD AND DRUGS SAMPLED The following table shows the various types of food and drugs sampled during the year : No of samples Beef Stock 1 Beer 2 Bitter Orange Concentrate 1 Blackcurrant Health Drink 1 Blackcurrants, tinned 1 Bubble Gum 1 Butter 1 Cheese Puffs 1 Chicken and Ham Paste 1 Chicken Stock 1 Chicken Supreme 1 Page Seventeen Of the above mentioned samples, 6 were reported as being unsatisfactory and details of these are set out below: Page Eighteen  No. of samples Coffee 2 Crab Spread with Butter 1 Cream 1 Cream Horns 1 Creamed Rice Milk Pudding 1 Curry Powder 1 Desiccated Coconut 1 Dried Fruit 1 Dripping 1 Fruit Pastilles 1 Glace Cherries 1 Ground Nutmeg 3 Ground Rice 1 Hot Pepper Sauce 1 Jam 1 Jelly 1 Ice Cream, soft 1 Lamb Chops, tinned 1 Lemon Squash 1 Liqueur Cocktails 1 Malted Tonic 1 Malt Vinegar 1 Marzipan 1 Meat Pudding 1 Milk 1 Milk, Channel Islands 10 Milk Bread 1 Milk Shake Syrup 1 Mince 1 Mincemeat 1 Orange Squash 1 Pepper, white 1 Pie Fillings 2 Pork Luncheon Meat 3 Saccharin Tablets 2 Sal Volatile, Spirit of 3 Sausages, Pork 2 Shandy 2 Soup, Cream of Mushroom 1 Tea 1 Tomato Puree 1 Tomato Sauce 1 Yellow Colouring 1 89 MINCE During 1963 proprietary preparations containing substantial proportions of nicotinic acid and ascorbic acid were widely being used to redden the natural red colour of raw meat. Following the use of excessive proportions of these mixtures, which resulted on occasions in people consuming the meat suffering unpleasant symptoms, the use of these substances in raw meat was prohibited by the Meat Treatment Regulations, 1964. A number of samples of mince were obtained early in the year and one was found to contain small additions of both nicotinic acid and ascorbic acid, contrary to the Regulations. In subsequent Court proceedings, the case against the butcher was dismissed due to a technical fault in the service of the summons. CREAM HORNS Cream is defined in the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, as that part of milk rich in butter fat, separated by skimming or otherwise. The pastries forming this particular sample were very clearly marked “CREAM HORNS” but the fat in the cream constituent of the sample consisted of imitation cream containing no butter fat and the pastries were therefore misdescribed. At a subsequent Court hearing, the baker concerned was fined £10 with £5 5s. Od. costs. PORK SAUSAGES The Preservative in Food Regulations permit sausages to be preserved with sulphur dioxide to the extent of 450 parts per million always provided that the presence of preservative is made known to the purchaser. Two samples purchased contained preservative within the permitted limit but no declaration was made at the time of sale. The sausages were satisfactory in respect of their meat content. Both butchers concerned were given warnings. SHANDY An informal sample of tinned Shandy was found to contain 1.05 per cent Alcohol (proof spirit) which in the opinion of the Council's Analyst, was poor for an article so described. Following communications with the manufacturers it was learned that they had recently increased the alcohol content of their Shandy to a minimum of 1.5 per cent proof spirit and that it appeared that the tin examined was old stock. SPIRIT OF SAL-VOLATILE, B.P.C. This sample was deficient in free ammonia. The minimum proportion of free ammonia prescribed by the British Pharmaceutical Codex is 1.12 per cent whereas this sample was found to contain only 0.78 per Page Nineteen cent. The sample was satisfactory in respect of the proportion of ammonium carbonate. This was an informal sample and was taken from a consignment delivered to a chemist's shop on the previous day. The attention of the wholesaler was drawn to the Analyst's Report and the whole of the stock withdrawn from sale. FACTORIES Routine visits to factories and outworkers for the purpose of the Factories Act were made during the year and a total of 215 inspections were made.. Nine contraventions of the Act were found during the year. Notices were served on the occupiers, which resulted in the necessary works being carried out to make the premises comply with the Act. INFESTATIONS Rodent Control During the year 501 complaints of rats and mice were investigated and where necessary the premises adjoining the houses from which the original complaints were received were also visited. In consequence 676 properties were inspected for the presence of rats and mice. Of these properties 493 were found to have signs of infestations and were treated. The number of complaints received during 1964 were approximately the same as the previous year. The infestations were all of a minor character though one or two were difficult to eradicate. Warfarin has been used in the majority of cases though where difficulty has been experienced further treatments using a different poison have usually produced results. SHOPS Routine inspections of shops under the Shops Act have continued and no serious contraventions have been observed during the year. Some of these inspections have to be made outside office hours and on Sundays in order to ascertain that the closing hours and the provisions regarding Sunday trading are being observed. CLEAN AIR During the year 1964 the Council continued with its programme under the Act. At the end of 1963 there were 4 smoke control areas operative which made 4,256 domestic dwellings subject to Smoke Control Orders and a fifth area was awaiting the approval of the Ministry. This order was approved without modification and immediately the approval was received the necessary forms and explanatory memoranda were sent to all owners and occupiers in the area covered by the Order. The Order became operative on 1st October,1964, and Page Twenty the number of applications received for approval of works under the Act was about 60% of the number of houses estimated to require works of adaptation. This, however, has been a feature of the areas which are now operative, and very few contraventions of the Orders have been noted. The usual procedure when a contravention is found is to visit the premises and to write the offender a letter pointing out the offence. This has usually had the desired effect and up to the present no case has arisen in which it has been necessary to take legal action. Since the Act came into force and the Council decided to institute a programme which will make the whole of the Urban District smokeless in a period of 12 years the general attitude of the public has been one of co-operation. This co-operation has undoubtedly made the work of the Department much easier and if it had not been forthcoming would have resulted in a complete breakdown of the programme for the District. At the end of 1964, the area of the District which is the subject of Smoke Control Orders is the area bounded by Longmore Avenue from the railway bridge, East Barnet Road to Cat Hill, Cat Hill to Park Road, then northwards along Park Road and northeasterly along Edgeworth Road to the roundabout and north to the Urban District boundary. The southern boundary being the north side of Chase Way, crossing Hampden Way and the north side of the passageway between No. 70 and No. 72 Hampden Way and then in a south-westerly direction to Pymmes Brook, to the northern boundary of the Great Northern London Cemetery to Brunswick Park Road; north along the west side of Brunswick Park Road to the northern boundary of Standard Telephones & Cables Ltd., west, north and then west along the said boundary to the railway embankment, west along the north side of the railway embankment to the Urban District boundary and on the west by the Urban District boundary and railway as far as the railway bridge over Longmore Avenue. The area at present subject to Smoke Control Orders comprises 5,569 houses. The Council at its December meeting approved Smoke Control Order No. 6 and the Order was sent to the Minister for confirmation. This area is bounded on the north by the south side of Chase Way, crossing Hampden Way and the south side of the passageway between No. 70 and No. 72 Hampden Way, No. 72 being in the area, and then in a south westerly direction to Pymmes Brook; on the east and south by the boundary of the District; on the west by Pymmes Brook. The area contains 1,011 private dwellings and it is estimated that 978 fireplaces require conversion or adaptation to satisfactorily burn smokeless fuel. The total capital cost of this work will be £15,440 of which the net estimated capital cost to the Council will be £4,632 after Exchequer grants have been received. This cost would, of course, only be realised if all the owners applied for grant, and from previous experience, this is unlikely. This area contains some 300 houses less Page Twenty-one than Order No. 4, the cost per house is, however, considerably higher— this being due to Circular No. 69/63 and the consequent increases in amounts allowed to householders for this purpose. However, it does give a householder a wider choice of more efficient appliances and with a reasonable grant towards the cost. The Council has continued to participate in the scheme for the measurement of air pollution and the necessary equipment has been in operation since early in 1962. The information derived from this equipment is forwarded to a centra] laboratory and forms part of the scheme for the estimation of air pollution in the Greater London area. In connection with this scheme a summary or monthly readings tor the year of 1963 is appended. SMOKE (microgrammes per cubic metre) Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec.

Although on paper an area becomes operative on the 1st October each year there still remains a number of householders who appear to leave works until the last moment and also a number of enquiries are received each year regarding earlier areas. NOISE ABATEMENT With the coming into operation of the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, “noise or vibration which is a nuisance” is added to the list of Statutory Nuisances for which action can be taken under Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. It should, however, be noted that in the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business it is a defence to prove that the best practicable means of preventing or counteracting the noise or vibration have been adopted. Not only may the Council take action but any three occupiers of premises who are affected by a noise may make complaint, as to a noise nuisance, to a justice of the peace, for action directly by the Court. During the year, complaints were received in respect of noise from 6 premises. Of these complaints, 4 were in respect of matters which did not constitute a nuisance within the meaning of the Act and were minor matters. They were investigated and after discussions with the parties concerned no further complaints have been received. Page Twenty-two The other 2 complaints were those 2 mentioned in last year's report. Complaints were received regarding a factory and as a result of these complaints, several reports were made to the Committee. The factory employed a firm of consultant specialists to make a report regarding the noise. This firm's report, of which a copy was sent to the Public Health Department, showed that they did not consider that a nuisance was being caused. The Public Health Department carried out an entirely separate investigation of this matter and, on assessing the results of this investigation, it was not considered that the noise level was sufficiently high to be a nuisance under the Act. In assessing the results, the report of the Committee on the Problem of Noise and its appendices were consulted. The noise level from this factory, whilst not sufficiently high to be a nuisance, does cause complaints to be made especially in summer and consequently the owners of the factory have been consulted and they have endeavoured to reduce the noise. However, there is no doubt that the only way to stop these complaints is for the factory to change the method of firing the furnaces from oil to gas, as mentioned in my Report for 1963—the roar of the oil fired furnaces being the main cause of complaint. The other complaint of noise was from the fiats over a 24 hour selfservice launderette, and was mentioned in my Report for 1963. The owners of this launderette have carried out considerable work to reduce the noise and there is no doubt that, when the various equipment is in good order, there is no nuisance from noise. However, several complaints were received after the owner had carried out the work and an investigation proved the nuisance to be caused by defects in the dry cleaning plant. A report on this matter was made to the Committee and a letter was subsequently written to the owners requesting that efficient and frequent servicing of the machines was carried out. OFFICES, SHOPS AND RAILWAY PREMISES This is the first time the above heading appears in the Annual Report. The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963, makes provision for the safety, health and welfare of people employed in these premises. The Act required that all premises within its scope should be registered by the 31st July, 1963, but most of the main provisions did not come into force until 1st August, 1964. In order to facilitate the registering of premises, the necessary forms were delivered by the Public Health Inspectors to such premises as were known to come within the purview of this legislation. A register of premises had to be compiled and an administrative system had to be devised so that the necessary information could be obtained and records kept. Premises which had not registered by December were re-visited to ascertain whether or not they came within the scope of the Section. It is proposed to send letters to persons who have not complied with this Page Twenty-three Section in January. A number of persons who applied for registration did not need to and were informed accordingly, and advice on the Act was given when requested. The premises registered should be inspected but, owing to the pressure of other work, this has not yet commenced. It is, however, hoped to make a start on this work in the New Year. OTHER INSPECTIONS Pet Shops Three persons are licensed to keep pet shops in the district and visits are made periodically to the premises. In each case the business has been found to be carried on satisfactorily. Fouling of Footways by Dogs A number of complaints have been received during the year concerning the fouling of footways by dogs. In all cases the complaints were investigated, but usually the complainants are not prepared to give evidence against neighbours or other nearby residents. Posters drawing attention to the provisions of the by-law concerning this matter were exhibited in the areas from which the complaints were received. National Assistance Act, 1948—Section 50 Burial of the Dead Under the above Act the Council may make arrangements for the funeral of persons dying where no provisions have or can be made privately. One case was dealt with under this section during 1964. WATER SUPPLY The Lee Valley Water Company supplies the district with its water supply. The supply is largely obtained from deep wells sunk into chalk. During the year ended 31st March, 1964, the Company took 5,576 samples of water representative of supply for bacteriological examination over the whole of its area of supply. Of these only 11 contained E Coli, giving a percentage of purity of 99.8 per cent. During the year the Water Company took 525 samples of water for bacteriological and 20 samples for chemical examination from the local supply. All these samples were satisfactory. In addition to the above 8 water samples for bacteriological examination were submitted by the Department to the Laboratory at Coppetts Wood Hospital. All these samples were satisfactory.
