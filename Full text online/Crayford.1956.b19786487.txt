Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1956. Prom the standpoint of the customary vital statistics, the health of the Urban District has been well maintained The infant mortality rate for 1956 was 23 1 per thousand live births compared with 18.3 per thousand in 1955 and an analysis of the eleven deaths shows that seven were associated with prematurity and congenital malformation, over which no significant degree of control is possible at present In regard to infectious disease, poliomyelitis constitutes the main challenge at the present time and little is known as to the conditions which determine whether any particular year will experience a heavy or mild incidence In the present state of knowledge, the most direct way of eliminating cases or, alternatively, of preventing serious paralysis, is the vaccination of as many individuals as possible, and it must be borne in mind that, although children must be given priority, all age groups in the population are susceptible and vaccination may *ell have to be extended to adults as well This, obviously, would introduce problems of the supply of vaccine and, also, of medical and nursing manpower to cope with the large scale of operations required, In Crayford, 91 registered children in the age group of 2 to 9 years received full inoculation during 1956 under arrangements made by the Local Health Authority These facilities are now being extended to Include children between the ages of one and two years. Tuberculosis is a disease which from a national point of view is diminishing both in incidence and mortality and, by a combination of B C G„. vaccination, mass radiography and modern medical and surgical treatment combined with the close supervision of infective cases within the community, it is likely that the risks from this disease could be reduced in the next (3) quarter of a century to a very considerable degree In the Urban District of Crayford a study of the figures for notifications and deaths over the past 20 years shows that, while deaths have fallen considerably, notifications of new cases have not decreased but this may be due to better methods of ascertainment, e.g., by Mass Miniature Radiography It cannot be stressed too often that tuberculosis, when associated with a serious degree of overcrowding and the presence of susceptible children is a hazard which must constantly be borne in mind During 1956, a small outbreak of paratyphoid B infection was experienced in the Borough of Bexley, a small number of cases occurring, also, in the Borough of Erith and the Urban District of Crayford (3) Cancer of the lung, which has attracted much attention in recent years because of its apparent association inter alia, with smoking, caused two more deaths in Crayford in 1956, (12 cases) than in 1955 (10 cases), and this accords with the experience in the country as a whole in which the mortality from this disease continues to rise In my 1955 Report I stated In the circumstances it seems reasonable to advise young people not to take up smoking and, in the case of heavy smokers of middle age, to say that published data indicate that there may be some diminution in risk to those who give up smoking even after many years of addiction " I think this is a warning which deserves to be repeated in view of the evidence, on good authority, that smoking among late schoolagers in many parts of the country is by no means inconsiderable With the passing of the Clean Air Act, 1956, the prevention of atmospheric pollution received its main legislative impetus, although one should not minimise the long term nature of the project which the Act envisages and the difficult technical problems which are involved Locally, of course, the main emphasis is on the establishment and gradual expansion of smoke control areas and the need to work in close collaboration with neighbouring authorities Although the Urban District does not experience the worst effect of atmospheric pollution, it will be recalled that about 50 per cent of such pollution results from the domestic hearth and much foresight will be called for in the installation in new housing estates of heating appliances capable of burning smokeless fuels The availability of these fuels is an important (4) aspect which is, no doubt, receiving the attention both of the Government and the various agencies concerned with their production A comprehensive exhibition of domestic heating appliances in relation to clean air is in course of preparation by the Council at the time of writing. The problem of health education of the public in connection with the declaration of smokeless zones is another matter which introduces the problem of staffing, and indeed, this applies to health education in general. In my 1954 Report I stated "A good case could be made for the appointment of a Health Education Officer to serve the district or such wider area as appeared to be indicated" and I am becoming more than ever convinced that such a development may be necessary.. A comprehensive policy of health education is a fairly costly matter and one of the main difficulties is the fact that health education is regarded in governmental circles as a matter for the Local Health Authority (The Kent County Council) under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, dealing with Prevention of Illness Care and After Care, and it is often forgotten that county districts also have a responsibility for this matter under Section 179 of the Public Health Act, 1936. This dichotomy of function is a real stumbling block from the point of view of instituting a full programme of health education in the Urban District, The need to disseminate accurate information on personal hygiene, on the prevention of accidents in the home and on the principles of healthy living in general, as well as on the nature and meaning of health, is becoming one of the most important aspects of health administration. This is dictated, not only by the needs of the individual but by the need also for economy in the use of the National Health Service, the cost of which is rising from year to year. The work of the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Home Safety Committee continued with the task of spreading information in regard to causes and prevention of accidents in the home. The Rotary Club of Bexley, during the year, presented an exhibition stand to this Committee which is being used to disseminate Propaganda in the form of leaflets and posters over the area, the stand was made by the Staff and boys of the Westwood County Secondary School, Welling, and our thanks are due both to the Rotary club and the School for their help (5) In conclusion I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement, and the Chief Public Health Inspector, Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for their excellent service during the year I am, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LANDON Medical Officer of Health (6) STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 2,698.71 Population (Registrar Generals estimate mid-year 1956) 29,530 Number of inhabited houses 9,260 Rateable Value £389,227 Sum represented by a penny rate £1,587 Live Births Total M F Legitimate 465 225 240 Illegitimate 11 6 5 476 231 245 Birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated home population - 16.1 General birth rate for England and Wales - 15.6 Stillbirths Total M F Legitimate 6 3 3 Illegitimate - - - 6 3 3 Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births - 12.44 Total M F Deaths 247 135 112 Death rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 8.36 General death rate for England and Wales - 11.7 The Birth Rate and Death Rate for Crayford compares favourably *ith that for other parts of the Country.

(20) The result of the Christmas Seals Sale, after deduction of administrative expenses, as reported by the Organiser to the Annual General Meeting amounted to £87.10s 4d. The County Organiser, Health Visitor, Chest physician and District Officer have given invaluable service to the Committee WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE This continued to provide an increasing demand on the services of the Health Department and the Crayford Old Peoples Welfare Committee. Many cases brought to the notice of the Department by the Committee Visitors and otherwise discovered, have been visited by the Medical Officer of Health and Chief Public Health Inspector. Arrangements have been made for entry into Old peoples Homes where this has been possible. The Visiting Service carried out by the Crayford Old Peoples Welfare Committee continues to flourish. Help is given to the old folk with clothing and small home comforts, gifts of tea and sugar. Two wheelchairs, one purchased by the Committee and one donated to the Committee, both for the purpose of loaning out to old people, are used extensively. Many services have been rendered to elderly people and much assistance is given by other Voluntary Organisations to the Old Peoples Welfare Committee. Last offices have been carried out by Visitors. Close co-operation is maintained with the Kent County Council's District Officer, the National Assistance Board, the Women's Voluntary Service, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and Nursing Division and Red Cross. (21) CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR'S REPORT To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council Mr Chairman, Ladles and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1956, which gives a general summary of the work carried out by the Public Health Inspectors during the year INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The inspection of food plays an important part in the activeties of the Health Department, and regular visits are paid to all food premises, particular attention being paid to those premises where food is prepared for sale In this connection a total of 937 inspections were carried out, 278 of which were to premises registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. The number of food premises in the area is as follows Bakers 4; Butchers 16, Grocers 58; Greengrocers 19; Confectioners 26; Fishmongers 8; Cafes, canteens, etc. 34; Public Houses 19 Off Licences 3; Clubs 12; Other premises 24 Under Section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, 56 premises are registered for the storage and sale of Ice Cream and 19 for the manufacture or preparation of preserved food intended for sale. Food Hygiene Regulations 1955 Since the implementation of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, a most comprehensive survey of all food premises has been carried out resulting in a general raising of standards in the district. Co-operation on the part of the traders themselves greatly assisted your Public Health Inspectors, who have continued to give advice on matters relating to food and general hygiene A total of 217 informal notices were served in connection with this work The following complaints were received and dealt with during the year:- A piece of liquorice novelty together with a small piece of wire alleged to have been contained therein, formed the basis (22) of one complaint. The firm in question employed the use of a metal detection machine and could only assume that a temporary failure of the device was the cause Alleged foreign matter contained in a sliced white loaf was identified as coarse stringy fluff from a flour bag and was stated to have been introduced into the loaf by the slicing machine. Greyish streaks in another loaf were ascertained to be caused by fragments of discoloured flour paste incorporated in the crumb; a harmless effect. Dark coloured material in a breakfast cereal was reported as being crushed wheat from the machinery. In all the above complaints it was deemed not necessary to take any further action, but a serious view was taken and warnings issued in respect of the following:- Mould growth in a small sliced loaf was due to an unusually long delay between baking and delivery, A sausage roll containing mould had been retained too long by the retailer. New stocks, it appeared, had been sold before the existing stock had been cleared, resulting in a disturbance of the normal rotation,, A pork pie from a different establishment had become mouldy for the same reason. A plastic fruit juice container had lost its contents and contained only mould. This was due to sulphur dioxide loss through the skin. The container was, however, stated by the manufacturers to have been old stock, and the remainder of the consignment had been withdrawn. Meat and other Foods The following articles were found during the year to be unfit for human consumption:- Beef 242 lbs Cooked Ham 21½ lbs. Lamb 24½ lbs. Luncheon Meat 69½ lbs. Offal 27½ lbs. Corned Beef 92½ lbs. Tinned Pish 454 lbs Jellied Veal 19 lbs. Fish 168 lbs. Tinned Fruit 55½ lbs. Bacon 7 lbs. Tinned Vegetables 14½ lbs. Tinned Meat 2 lbs. Jam 1½ lbs. Cheese 5 lbs.
