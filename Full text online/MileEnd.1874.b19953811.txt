The prescribed period for submitting the Annual Report of the proceedings of the Vestry having again arrived, the Vestry do so with much pleasure and with an assurance that their acts will meet with the approbation of the Ratepayers. In the first place, the Vestry regret to announce the loss of four of their number, viz.: Messrs. Crow, Musto, and Poole, and Dr. Snell, who had whilst in the Vestry used their best exertions for the good of the Hamlet. The Vestry do not deem it necessary here to enter into all the details of the various paving and sanitary works which have been executed and carried out during the year, as accounts in extenso will be found in the several reports of the Surveyor, Medical Officer, and Inspector of Nuisances appended hereto, and to which the Vestry beg to refer. The work of paving the Mile End Road has been most efficiently completed by Mr. J. J. Griffiths, the Contractor, and the Vestry feel sure that the Ratepayers appreciate the improved condition of the road, so far as the part under the immediate control of the Vestry is concerned. The Vestry however must say that notwithstanding all their efforts to have the part used by the Tramway Company kept in proper condition, it has not been so, and that part the Vestry fear will ever prove a source of trouble. The Vestry have, during the year, been enabled at a very small cost to effect a long and much needed improvement in widening the entrance to South Grove. 8 The owner of the land being about to commence building operations, the Vestry entered into negociations for the purchase of so much of the land as was required to carry out the improvement,and succeeded in obtaining it for a sum of £100, of which the Metropolitan Board of Works has agreed to pay £50, so that this important work has been carried out for the small cost (exclusive of the cost of paving) of £50. Having made the improvement at the entrance, the Vestry deemed it their duty to exercise their powers and have the whole length of the road and footpaths on the East side of South Grove made up and paved at the expense of the owners of property abutting thereon, and passed the necessary resolutions, but the Guardians of Whitechapel Union (to whom a greater portion of such property belongs) resist the claim, and the matter will probably have to be submitted to a legal tribunal. The Road was however in such a condition that the Vestry considered it inadvisable to defer executing the work, and accordingly entered into a contract to have it done, and the same has been completed. A builder having commenced to erect houses on one side of Ernest Street, at a distance less than 20 feet from the centre of the Road, representations were made to the Metropolitan Board, who instituted proceedings against such builder, but the matter was subsequently arranged by his agreeing to conform to the requirements of the Vestry. During the year there have been five applications for compensation for alleged injuries from accidents alleged to have occurred through the non-repair of the roads, but the Vestry having denied their liabity no further proceedings have boen instituted. A pipe, in the Commercial Road, belonging to the East London Water Company, having burst, the escape 9 of water caused a subsidence along that part of the road which lay over the main laid down by the Chartered Gas Company some five years ago, for at least 50 yards on each side of the fracture. The Water Company denied their liability, and proceedings had to be taken before a Magistrate for penalties under the Act, but the decision of the Magistrate being against them and the Vestry assenting the Company subsequently properly reinstated the damaged part. The old sewer in the Mile End Road, between Stepney Green to Globe Road, (having become in parts unsafe) has been broken up. On the 11th July last, one of the most violent thunder storms that had been witnessed for years burst over the Metropolis, inflicting considerable damage in many parts of the Hamlet by causing the overflow of the drains in the basements of houses. The main sewers, which are quite sufficient in all ordinary cases, undoubtedly were not equal to the task of carrying off the immense volume of water which fell, and the Vestry express their sincere regret at the losses which have been sustained, but it is obvious that such a contingency could not be provided for except at an immense expense. The contract for horses, carts, and drivers shews increased rates. The tender of Mr. Mansfield, for the removal of dust for the ensuing year was accepted, and there is an increase of £205 over the price for last year. A list of all the contracts entered into will be found at the end of the abstract of accounts. The necessary orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works have been received for re-numbering and abolish- B 10 ing the subsidiary names in the following streets and roads, viz: 1. Burdett Road. 2. Commercial Road. 3. Grafton Street. 4. Sidney Square. Orders of the same Board have also been received for re-naming and re-numbering the following roads and streets in manner following: Names of Streets or Roads abolished. Names by which same henceforth to be called. 1. Regent Street North Maplin Street Recent Street South 2.• Regent Road North Coutts Road Regent Road South 3. Vincent Street (South Ward) Perth Street Sceptre Street 4. Charles Street (North Ward) 5. Johnson Street Harford Street York Road Bancroft Place The precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works and School Board for London again exhibit a considerable increase over those of last year, as appears by the following table. 1875. 1874. Metropolitan Board 6091 1 7 4858 5 6 School Board 3496 0 6 1989 3 9 The Vestry would impress on the Ratepayers the fact that the increase alone in these precepts will require a rate of 2½d. in the pound to provide for it. The money required by the Vestry to provide for the due carrying out of the works entrusted to it, and for payment of the interest on and instalments of principal 11 off the loans has during the year required a rate of 1/8 in the pound. The Vestry have made arrangements for gradually paying off the portion of the debt of the late Trustees of the Commercial Road, transferred to the Vestry, which amounts to £2205 8s. 2d. The Vestry, in October last, duly paid the first instalment of £1250 off the loan of £25000 from the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Vestry gave their sanction to the Assessment Committee of the Hamlet appearing as Respondents before the General Assessment Sessions on the appeal of the School Board for London to have the Assessment in respect of the Board Schools in Essex Street; Johnson Street; St. Pauls Road: and Gloucester Street reduced. £ s. d. The aggregate of the rateable value in the list was 1960 0 0 And the School Board desired it to be reduced to 659 16 8 Being a difference of £1300 3 4 The principle on which such schools should be rated had never been decided, and the Vestry are pleased to say that it has been reported to them that the principle adopted by the Assessment Committee was upheld, and the appeal dismissed with costs. The principle thus laid clown will act as the guide for assessing the other Board Schools in the Metropolis. After mature consideration it was determined to dispose of the Old Watch House in the Mile End Road, which had been obtained in the manner mentioned in the Vestry's last report, and the Vestry have to congratulate the Ratepayers that the large sum of £510 was obtained for it. 12 The Vestry have made every provision for the efficient carrying out of the Aldulteration of Food, &c., Act, 1872, and appointed Dr. Coener as Analyst, and Mr. Leshaw as Inspector thereunder. The salary of the analyst has been fixed at £52 10s., and a fee of 7s. 6d. for each analysis. The fee payable by a private purchaser to have an article analyzed is 5s. In consequence of the numerous additional duties which have from time to time been cast upon the Inspector of Nuisances by the legislature, and also on account of his appointment as Inspector under the Adulteration Act, the Vestry have increased Mr. Leshaw's salary to £160 per Annum. The Vestry desire to bring to the notice of the Ratepayers the great increase in the number of public bills brought before Parliament which would affect this Hamlet. In the Session of 1874 there were (a) The Metropolitan Building and Management Bill. (b) The Locomotives on Roads Bill. (c) The Slaughter-houses Bill. In the 'present Session there are (d) Municipality of London Bill. (e) Metropolis Gas Companies Bill to amend the Metropolis Gas Act 1860. (f) Metropolis Gas Works. (g) Metropolis Gas Undertakings Purchase. (h) Artizans Dwellings Bill. (i) Freeing Bridges. (k) Adulteration of Food &c. Each of the aforegoing was deemed by the Vestry to be of such importance that it was referred to a special committee for consideration and report. 13 Several of the Bills were either withdrawn or thrown out, but they each and all received most careful attention, and where it was apparent that the Vestry would not be allowed a locus standi before the Committees they caused urgent representations to be made through the proper channels on any points which they considered objectionable. Of the three first-mentioned Bills the last only passed into law. One of the effects of that Act is, to give the Metropolitan Board of Works power to make regulations for the government of slaughter houses, and to appear before the Licensing Justices and oppose any license. The Bills mentioned in items (g) and (i) will not be proceeded with. The Municipality of London Bill, introduced into the House of Commons by Lord Elcho, is another attempt in the direction taken first by the late Mr. J. S. Mill and afterwards by the late Mr. C. Buxton. Lord Elcho, in introducing it, admitted that he had not given the matter much attention, and it would appear from the form of the Bill that the idea of the promoters is to legislate on certain theoretical ideas without very distinct knowledge of what they are seeking to abolish. The Vestry do not think it at all probable that the Bill as drawn has the slightest chance of becoming law. The Metropolis Gas Companies Bill (e) will be pressed on by the promoters (the Metropolitan Board), and the Vestry hope that it will be successful, as the proceedings of the Gas Companies, as a rule, shew that some legislation to make the interests of the Companies and Consumers more identical is much required. The Artizans Dwellings Bill, will give power to the Metropolitan Board of Works (under certain control) to deal effectually with many of the unhealthy closelypacked districts in the Metropolis. The Act is not confined to the Metropolis only. 14 The Sale of Food and Drugs Act will, if passed as drawn, render nugatory many of the forms, &c., which the Vestry have had prepared. The Vestry considered some of the clauses so objectionable that they caused special representation to bo made to the Home Secretary. In addition to the public Bills before mentioned, there have been numerous private Bills which required even more careful attention than the public Bills, as the proceedings in connection therewith do not receive so much public attention. In the Session of 1874 there was (1) The Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion and Eastern Extension Railway. And in the present Session there arc (2) Aldgato and Bow Railway. (3) East Metropolitan Railway. (4) Great Eastern Railway. (5) Regents Canal and Dock. (6) Commercial Gas Bill. The idea of the promoters of the scheme No. 1 was twofold, first to complete the inner circle, and secondly to have an arm running: down the centre of the Whitechapel, Mile End, and Bow Roads to the North London Railway at Bow. The first part of the scheme was passed but not the second. The promoters of the schemes, Nos. 2 and 3, both proposed to have a lino running down the centre of the last-mentioned roads, but the scheme No. 2 was thrown out on standing orders, and No. 3 was abandoned. The Great Eastern Railway propose to provide what has long been a great necessity, and that is a station at Devonshire Street. The Regents Canal and Dock Bill, so far as it affects this Hamlet, consists in tho widening of tho canal in 15 places and the formation of a line of railway by the side of the towing path. The railway is to have junctions with the Great Eastern. The Bill of the Commercial Gas Company is to sanction an amalgamation with the Ratcliff Gas Company, and to provide additional capital and fresh sites for works. The Bill will no doubt be considered (together with the Bills of certain other companies) by the Committee appointed to consider the before-mentioned Bill of the Metropolitan Board. It is obvious that unless these Bills are properly watched, and proper provisions secured in the interests of the ratepayers for regulating the method in which the works are to be executed and otherwise, a very serious injury might be committed, and the Vestry have, in each case, caused petitions to be presented to parliament in order to obtain a locus standi before the Committees which will be appointed to consider such bills. There have been Twenty Vestry Meetings; Eightythree Meetings of the Standing Committees; and Sineteen Meetings of Special Committees; and it is sufficient proof of the great attention which the members of the Vestry give to their duties when it is stated that the average attendance at each Vestry is over fifty. The Accounts for the year ending the 25th March last, have been duly audited, vouched, and allowed, and the abstract thereof, as certified by the Auditors pursuant to the statute, is published with this report.

REPORT of THE SURVEYOR to THE VESTRY of the Hamlet of Mile End old Town. 18 7 5 REPORT. Gentlemen, I have now much pleasure in laying before you a statement of the various works carried out under my superintendence during the year ending March 25, 1875. The paving of the roadways of Mile End Road and Commercial Road, together with the streets paved with the old stone from these roads, have been maintained by Messrs. Mowlem and Mr. Griffiths, under their contracts, and at the end of the agreed time the roads were handed over to you in a satisfactory condition. Carriageway Paving. The only work of importance under this head has been carried out at the entrance to Stepney Green ; the quantity laid was 575 yards, and the total cost £406 17s. 6d. Footway Paving. During the year there has been laid 5,050 feet of 2½-inch, and 10,123 feet of 2-inch paving. The cost has been £416 6s. 2d. The following tables shew so favorable a comparison with all former years, and prove the statements made in my special report to you two years since, on the subject of paving the Mile End and Commercial Roads, that I think scarcely necessary to do more than let them speak for themselves.

REPORT on the PUBLIC HEALTH & SANITARY CONDITION of Mile End Old Town, foe the YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1875, by MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. London: Printed by T. Penny & Co., 121, Leman Street, WHITECHAPEL, E, 1875. REPORT. Gentlemen, In compliance with the requirements of the Metropolis Local Management Act, I have the honour to submit the Nineteenth Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary condition of the Hamlet for the year ending March, 1875. Having been deprived of the District Registrars' returns since the 10th of October, 1874, I am not able to supply as much statistical information of interest and importance as usual, in relation to the public health; many details are necessarily wanting, and in some cases only can even the gross numbers be given, without being able to state the causes of death from different diseases. The number of deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases I have however obtained from the Registrar General's printed returns. The most serious consequence of the loss of the district Registrars' weekly returns has been my inability to obtain through any other channel a regular and reliable knowledge of the existence of epidemic diseases and the locality where prevailing, for although this information was "post mortem," and often many days after the occurrence of such deaths, still it was a most valuable guide, when scarcely any other was available, by which we were enabled to enforce sanitary measures and prevent as far as possible the extension of disease. This source of information has been entirely suppressed, and apparently can only be restored by some arrangement between the registration officers and the Vestry. Be this as it may, the loss of the use of these documents is a serious matter, and prevents much good practical sanitary work being done in places where most needed, where disease 4 ually exists and deaths are occurring. To what extent these preventible diseases have been spread, and how many lives have been sacrificed by the withdrawal of this means of information, which might have been saved, it would be impossible accurately to estimate, but that both these injurious and fatal results have occurred can scarcely bo doubted, unless upon the ground that sanitary science is a delusion and its application consequently inoperative. Births. There were 4010 children registered as having been born in the hamlet during the year ; I cannot apportion the sexes owing to the absence of the district Registrars' returns. This number shows an increase of 105 over the previous year, and of 231 over the average of five previous years, giving a birth-rate of a little over 4 per cent, or 40 per 1000 of the population as compared with 36.12 for the metropolis, and 36.05 for the whole country. If it is the rule, as some eminent vital staticians believe and have attempted to prove, that a high birth rate and low death rate are incompatible, Mile End Old Town has for some years proved an exception. Marriages. The total number of marriages registered was 949, showing a marriage rate within a fraction of 19 per 1000 of the population. This is consistent with the high birth rate. The marriage rate for the whole country during the same period was 17.2 per 1000. In the metropolis the rate was 18.5. Deaths. The number of deaths during the year was 2165, showing an increase of 57 over the previous year, and of 25 above the average of five previous years, but this incrcaso is little more than proportionate to increase of 5 lation, hence the comparison is scarcely unfavourable. The annual rate of mortality was 21.65 per 1000 population living. In the two registration divisons of the Hamlet the death rate was 21 in the Western and 22.5 in the Eastern per 1000 of the population. The former having a total of 821 and the latter of 1344 deaths. Zymotic Mortality. The total number of deaths certified or registered as from infectious or preventible diseases was 422, including 105 from diarrhoea. Of these 159 occurred in the Western and 265 in the Eastern Registration Division. The annual rate per 1000 population was 4.0 in the Western and 4.34 in the Eastern Division. If the 105 deaths from diarrhoea be deducted, there would remain 317 deaths from the sixprincipal infectious diseases, viz., small pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, fever, giving a death rate of 3.17, or including diarrhoea of 4.2 per 1000; the corresponding rate for the whole metropolis was 3.25, and for eighteen large towns 4.47 per 1000 population. Of the 62 deaths from fever 19 occurred in the Western and 43 in the Eastern divisions of the Hamlet, giving a rate per 1000 of 0.487 or nearly a person to the former, and 0.705 or nearly ¾ of a person to the latter division. Eleven deaths were registered as from cholera and choleraic diarrhoea during the autumn quarter of 1874. The area of the Hamlet in statute acres is 679, of these 189 comprise the Western and 490 the Eastern Registration Division ; the population per acre in each is 206.3 in the Western and 124.5 in the Eastern ; an equal distribution over the whole area of the Hamlet would give 147.3 persons to an acre. In the whole area of the metropolis there are 45.7 persons to an acre, this is of course inclusive of large open spaces, parks, &c., of which We have none in this Hamlet. In addition to the interest of these facts my principal object is to elucidate 6 if possible the reason for the disproportionate death rates from these diseases between the two divisions of the Hamlet; this is apparently a difficult problem to solve, from the fact that the mortality has been greater inversely to density of population. We are all aware of the crowded condition of the West Ward and some other portions of the Western Registration District. An approximate explanation may be found in the probability that the population is more fixed than that in the worst portions of the Eastern division, and as such the people take more interest in the sanitary condition of their dwellings ; another point is, and one which I think contributes much to the favorable comparison, that there aro many common lodging-houses in the West Ward ; these houses are under the vigilant surveillance of the police, some officers being specially allotted to the duty. The houses are consequently rigidly kept in constantly good sanitary condition ; otherwise, from the class of peoplo occupying them they would be overcrowded, dirty, and out of repair, and would add considerably to the mortality of those diseases which are generated and fostered by such conditions. Again, many of the new houses in the Eastern Division have been built upon ground entirely unprepared previously for the foundations and erection of dwellings, much of this ground having been probably for years tho depository for refuse of all kinds, in addition to the organic decay and malaria within itself; from such a foundation pestilent emanations must ariso into the warmed air inside the superstructure. This latter may also be constructed of materials pregnant with danger to health, and even containing the active germs of disease in building materials from old infected houses, all of which the law has hitherto recognized, or at least not attempted to prevent. I have before referred to the fact of newly-inhabited lacalities, even in apparently the most favored 7 tions, being specially liable to outbreaks of epidemic diseases.

Sanitary Inspector's Report of Works Executed during the Years 1874—1875. Houses and premises connected with sewers 120 Old drains abolished 110 Houses cleansed and purified 130 Houses disinfected 54 Houses visited where contagious diseases had occurred, and notices left, re contagious diseases 117 Traps provided to closets and drains 94 Foul and defective drains cleansed and repaired 192 Cesspools abolished 28 Water supply provided to houses, &c 17 Accumulations of dung and offensive matter removed 30 Premises from which pigs were removed 17 During the year inspections have been made of premises where offensive works were carried on, and the necessary orders given for the abatement of nuisances. In all cases coming to my knowledge I have removed and properly disinfected (with the consent of the owners) all bedding and clothing used by persons suffering from infectious diseases. In addition to the above, all bakehouses have been visited twice during the year, and where necessary notices were served requiring the respective owners to limewhite and otherwise cleanse the same. The slaughter and cow houses in the Hamlet have likewise been frequently visited, and many improvements effected. HENRY LESHAW. 10 Deaths at different Ages. I can onlv state the number of deaths at the two extremes, viz., under one year and above GO years. There were 598 deaths in children under one year of age, and 480 in persons above 60 years of age, so that of the 2165 deaths, one-half occurred at these two extremes of age. Pure Air, Open Spaces and Play Grounds. Clauses 5 and 12 of the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Act, of last Sessiqn, will I think give power to the local authority, under special circumstances, to provide open spaces, and it is earnestly to be hoped that such power will be acted upon wherever opportunity occurs, after demolition of large blocks of houses, that the areas may be retained as open spaces or play grounds. Much has of late been said for their necessity, and some little has been done in providing or securing them about the metropolitan suburbs, places practically inaccessible to the inhabitants of tho densely populated central districts, but the absolute necessity that they should be provided in the centre of every densely populated district has not yet been realized : every year adds to the difficulty and cost in providing them, while it is equally certain that at a not very distant period increased knowledge of sanitary matters among the general public will demand their provision, as the most valuable and common sense bases for the promotion and maintenance of public health in a human hive like London. The atmosphere of London is contaminated from so many sources, both by its respiratory consumption and tho addition of deleterious matters, that we should at least use all available means to keop it wholesome and 11 clean, but in London during the day at the height of traffic the air we breathe is and can be seen as a cloud of scarcely impalpable composition, this mainly arises from the condition of the surface of the roads and streets, and is injurious not only by displacement of pure air by foreign matters, but is an ever-present means for the conveyance of poisonous substances, and maybe specific germs of disease into the system through the lungs, and by infecting food and drink. The only means we at present know of to mitigate these evils is by the most efficient method of road cleansing, this means increased cost and increased rates; yet if we could reconcile our views of present cost to the ultimate good results sure to be attained, the first cost would be the true economy, not only in the saving of health and life, but from the utilitarian aspect of preservation of property, as in the cases of clothes and furniture, which it is well known are destroyed by the dust and other impurities suspended in the air. Atmospheric pollution is derived from many other sources, over some of which we have little or no control, but this fact makes it more imperative that we should suppress as far as possible those sources over which we have control. We cannot prevent the pollutions arising from respiration and the exhalations generally from living beings, but we can prevent or mitigate those arising from detrition of the surface of roads and streets, from sewer gases, dust and refuse accumulations, &c. Pure air is the first essential to health, and I have been induced to make these general remarks, not because local authorities pay less attention to the removal of the causes which affect its purity, but because I think much more might be done, and that with every regard to ultimate economy; the enormously increased traffic and population of the metropolis necessarily produces a corresponding increase in the surface filth and refuse of the roads ; much of this becomes sufficiently impalpable 12 to be suspended and conveyed in the atmosphere, penetrates into houses, and is of course inspired with the air into our lungs, or deposited about the portals thereto, hence by the latter means much of the throat disease which always prevails in London in the autumnal season may be attributable to this foul condition of the atmosphere. We have all observed the healthy contrast presented by plants and trees under glass cases or in houses in London, with those exposed in the open air; in the dirtiest and dingiest streets plants so protected and supplied with filtered air look clean and luxuriant; the human organism is susceptible to like influences from similar causes: smoke is of course a large contributor to the general sum of pernicious impurities. There is a probability of these apparently minor dangers to the public health being somewhat overlooked in the attractions of those of a more imposing kind, but which may not have a corresponding or even equal influence upon the public health. The evil is cumulative year by year, and with the present rate of metropolitan expansion it has become only a question of time, when the atmosphere of London, or rather the material compound representing it, will become irrespirable or not respirable compatible with healthy existence. Improved roads, footpaths and paving, with efficient means for cleansing the surface, and preventing the dust rising into the air, an improved system of dust and refuse removal from houses, and general smoke consumption, are among the principal measures towards the maintenance of atmospheric purity. Sewer gas is a great and at present less tractable offender, but is perhaps not so perpetually injurious to health as its confederates above ground; still, the offensive smells from sewer gratings and ventilators are a constant source of complaint, and much injury to the public health must result therefrom. 13 New Buildings. Daring the year 151 new buildings were erected in the Hamlet, viz: Dwelling Houses 124 Warehouses 25 Model Lodging Houses 2 Total 151 For this return I am indebted, as usual, to the courtesy of Mr. Legg, the District Surveyor. This addition to house accommodation will not I fear diminish any over-crowding which may exist in other dwellings, but will add to the population by immigration from other places. I think all the open spaces in the Hamlet have now been covered with buildings. T liis may add to material prosperity, but in a sanitary and health aspect it is unfortunate that all such oases are lost for purposes of recreation, and especially as playgrounds for children, for whom the natural physical exercise embraced in their play is essential to bodily and mental development and health. Water Supply. The supply from the East London Company has been generally abundant, and in purity it has contrasted very favourably with the waters supplied by other companies, with the exception of June, 1874, and January and February, 1875, when the quality was deteriorated by heavy rains, which interfered with filtration and storage. The water has been good and exceptionally free from organic or sewage contamination. This favourable condition mainly results from long storage and efficient filtration. About 230 gallons a day were supplied to each house, or 27 gallons to each person; this was exclusive 14 of water supplied for manufacturing or other than domestic purposes. If the people had the means for storing this supply, and the will and knowledge to use it to the best advantage, the good sanitary and moral effects would be incalculable. The law still empowers Water Companies to deprive houses and occupiers for an unlimited period of their water supply; this power is being continually exercised in the poorest districts, where the greatest danger to the public health is presented; the object is to enforce payment of water rates from defaulting non-resident house owners. This starvation process is sometimes kept up for weeks, until the innocent occupiers resent the cruelty by withholding rent: that disease and death result from these unjust and arbitrary proceedings is certain. The Companies prefer this method of recovering their rates to the summary one, with which they are also empowered, of proceeding in a court of law. I have frequently reported such cases occurring in this Ilamlet to the Vestry, and expressed my opinion of the cruelty and extreme danger to the public health entailed by the continual exercise of this oppressive and irresponsible power, Its continuance by the Legislature, and enforcement by the companies, is simply a disgrace to both. Gas. I have frequently tested the gas supplied to the Hamlet by the Commercial Gas CDmpany. The illuminating power of the gas from an Argand burner, compared with that of two sperm candles, as required by law, was never below the legal standard, but has been, although rarely, as low as 12.5 and 13. The average illuminating power was 14 candlcs. Of the usual chemical impurities, sulphuretted hydrogen was never present. Ammonia was under the quantity permitted by the Act. 15 Cow and Slaughter Houses. Forty-two applications were made for licenses to keep cows and 36 for slaughter houses. Eleven were opposed on the ground that the premises were unfit for the purpose, or that the necessary works were not completed. Of these, 8 complied with the requirements of your committee and officers, and were allowed, 1 was withdrawn, and 2 were refused. Considerable improvements have been effected of late years upon the suggestions of your officers, both as to slaughter and cow houses. In the case of cow houses I have, after long persuasion, convinced the proprietors of the wisdom of greater and improved ventilation ; there has been in consequence much less lung disease, whereas its increase had been predicted by the owners of the animals. By the Act of 1874 the Metropolitan Board of Works is constituted the Local Authority for the Metropolis, except the City of London. The Board has made byelaws, as empowered to do under the Act; these bye-law3 prescribe the sanitary condition and arrangements of the premises to be observed before the granting of the license, but it is provided that these Bye-laws shall not lessen or affect the authority of Yestries and District Boards; I believe if carried out literally they will do much good, and assist the officers of the Yestry in carrying out their duties. In Bye-law (15) relating to water supply to the slaughterhouse, it should have provided that the supply be entirely separate and distinct from that for domestic, closet, or any other purposes whatever; this I had succeeded in getting adopted in many instances. The lairs in which animals are kept previous to slaughtering should have been included in clause 19; this lias also been adopted in most cases in this Hamlet. 16 The reports under the Adulteration of Food, &c., Act were ordered to be printed and issued with this report, and are appended.

To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, In compliance with the requirements of this Act, I have the honor to submit my report for the quarter ending March, 1875. The number of articles analysed during the quarter was 24, consisting of 6 samples of Milk 4 „ Arrowroot 3 ,, Mustard 4 ,, Tea 4 ,, Coffee 3 ,, Cocoa The samples of milk numbered 1, 2, 5 and 6 were genuine, those numbered 3 and 4 had a very small quantity of water added, and proportionate amount of cream removed: the water added was about 4 per cent. in the case of No. 3, and 2 per cent. in that of No. 4. In Nos. 5 and 6, although sour when examined, and the per centage of cream could not be accurately ascertained, still both were evidently extra rich, No. 5 containing at least 16 per cent. of cream, and being otherwise a genuine milk, and No. 6 at least 40 per cent. of cream. This latter could not have been a fair sample, either the object of the purchaser was known or suspected, or the sample was carelessly taken from the surface of the liquid after it had been standing for some time. Of the 4 samples of arrowroot all were genuine, being free from other starches. Of the 3 samples of mustard all were genuine, and free from starch, turmeric, &c. No. 8 contained a little of the husk of the mustard seed. 20 Of the 4 teas, Nos. 9 and 10 were genuine, being free from other leaves. No. 14 free from other leaves, but appeared to have been damaged, and a very few pieces of Prussian blue were found. No. 16 is free from other leaves than tea—is faced with Prussian blue, but only slightly. Coffee, 4 samples—Nos. 17, 19 and 24 are genuine. No. 21 is considerably adulterated with chicory, containing about 30 per cent. of that adulteration. Cocoa, Nos. 18, 20 and 23. 18 and 23 are genuine, and free from added starch. No. 23 contains not more than one per cent. of sago starch added. All these articles were purchased by the Inspector. I have not received any samples from the general public. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, MATTHEW CORNER. Vestry Hall, April, 1875. 21 ADULTERATION OF FOOD, &c., ACT. To the Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my report, under the provisions of the above Act, for the quarter ending June, 1875. I have received 20 samples, all from the Inspector; of these, 5 were bread, 6 flour, 1 lime juice, 2 green tea, 2 arrowroot, 2 coffee, 1 chocolate powder, 1 cocoa. The breads, Nos. 25, 32, 34 and 36 were genuine, no alum being present, and no other starch except that of wheat being present. In No. 30 there was a suspicion of the presence of alum, but not sufficient to be estimated. The lime juice (29) contained 17 per cent, of water, and 5.31 of citric acid—was not adulterated. The flours were all genuine, and free from other than wheat starch. The green teas were genuine, but slightly faced with Prussian blue; and 38 and 40 contained 7.75 and 6.80 per cent. of moisture. The arrowroots were genuine. The coffees were genuine. The chocolate powder was genuine. The cocoa was genuine. As in the previous quarter there were no samples brought by the public for analysis, at least no person complied with the requirements of the Act. I have tabulated the results of the analyses of the various articles in a separate book, for reference, if necessary. I wish to add, that duplicate samples of all these articles have been preserved, and numbered for 22 cation; it is therefore, competent for the Vestry to order the independent analysis of any or all such samples. I consider the results of these analyses as very satisfactory to both purchasers and sellers in this Hamlet, as also to this Board. Nearly all the articles were genuine, and the small remainder practically so: there was only one exception, in the way of considerable adulteration, in the sample of coffee, No. 21, already referred to. Altogether, I consider the Act of 1872 has proved satisfactory beyond expectation, both by its deterrent effects and its practical working. The Bill of 1875, which I believe has not yet finally passed into an Act, appears after every discussion to become more assimilated to that of 1872. I believe, however, it will contain necessary and just modifications in favor of the seller, without at the same time prejudicing the interests of the purchaser. Clauses 5 to 8 in the new Act are so modified as to avoid. protection to really fraudulent sellers, and clause 8 will have a strong influence in the same direction. Judging by my observations of the general influence and working of the Adulteration Act, I believe it has been productive of much good, but trading competition contributes in a large degree to ensure excellency and purity in human food. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, MATTHEW CORNER. Vestry Hall, July 21st, 1875.
