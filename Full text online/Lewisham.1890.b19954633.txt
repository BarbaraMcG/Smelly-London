The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. THE BOARD'S REPORT For the year ended 25th March, 1891, Prepared by Order of the Board, under the 198th sect. of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Victoria, cap. 120). The Board of Works for the Lewisham District present the following Report of proceedings taken by them during the twelve months ended Lady-day, 1891. The District over which the Board exercise jurisdiction comprises the Parish of Lewisham (including Sydenham Chapelry) and the Hamlet of Penge. The principal centres are:—Blackheath—Lewisham—Ladywell and Brockley— Catford—Forest Hill—Upper Sydenham—Lower Sydenham —Anerley and Penge. the area of the District is 6544 acres, viz., Lewisham 5774 and Penge 770 acres, and it holds a population, estimated at Midsummer, 1890, at 94,458, occupying 15,094 houses. The Census Returns of 1891 give the population as 92,047, viz., Lewisham 72,272 and Penge 20,375. The following are some of the principal Acts the Board are called upon to administer, or by which their action is regulated:— The Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending and extending the same. The Highways Acts and the General Paving, Metropolis Act, 1817 (various sections). The Nuisances Removal Act for England, 1855; The Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Acts amending and extending the same. 8 The Sale of Food and Drugs, &c., Acts. The Advertising Stations (Rating) Act, 1889. The Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. The Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Act, 1890. The Board are also a Local or Road Authority under the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Acts, 1868, and the amending Acts, and the Tramways and Electric Lighting Acts, and have various powers under the Metropolitan Open Spaces and other Acts. The Board submit herewith:- An account in abstract, showing their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1891; a summary statement of their Assets and Liabilities on that day; and a statement of the contracts entered into by them during the year ended 25th March, 1891. The Board also submit, in their usual form, certain details of such Receipts and Expenditure and Assets and Liabilities, and A statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1888-9, 1889-90, and 1890-91, and A table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1891. The Board submit the Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the District for the year ended 31st December, 1890, on the sanitary condition of the District. In the opening paragraph of that report the Medical Officer states: "the sanitary condition of the Lewisham District during the year 1890 has been eminently satisfactory. There has been a slight rise in the death rate, but this has been due to causes which have raised the death rate for 1890 over the whole kingdom. Those causes were, in the first place, the Influenza epidemic, which accounted, both directly and indirectly, for a large increase in the number of deaths at the beginning of the year; and, secondly, the intense cold daring the last part of the year, which was fatal in many instances to both very young and very old persons. 9 withstanding these unfavourable conditions, the death rate for the district during 1890 was 13.9 per 1000, which compares favourably not only with that of the other outlying districts of London, but also with that of most of the principal health resorts." A perusal of the Medical Officer's report, and the statistical statements appended thereto, will afford much valuable information as to the sanitary condition of the district. The Board also submit the Report of the Surveyor for the year ended 25th March, 1891, on the various works relating to the Highways, Lighting, Watering, Sewerage Works, Street Improvements, and other Works projected and carried out during the year, showing the extent of those works, and affording general information with reference to the same; and also with reference to the applications or notices as to House Building, Drainage, New Sewers, New Streets, and all other works. Expenditure. The Local Expenditure of the Board in the year shows an increase upon that of previous years, and this is mainly due to the work done during an exceptionally severe winter. In addition to the exceptional expenses rendered necessary for the work done in removal of snow, provision has to be made for the increased mileage of the roads to be repaired, lighted, and watered, and the other increased and continually increasing responsibilities of the Board, and the increased and increasing price of materials, &c. In consequence of the unusually severe winter and the increased expenditure thereby entailed, the Estimates for the year were somewhat exceeded. The greater part of the increased expenditure was entirely unforseen. The sum raised last year in Lewisham was £37,500, or equivalent to a rate of 1s 6¾d. in the pound on the Rateable Value in force at the commencement of the year. In Penge the sum raised was £10,000, or equivalent to 1s. 3¾d. in the pound; but these sums do not include the increased expenditure above referred to. 10 Rateable value. The Rateable Value of the District, at March, 1891, was— Lewisha £477,685 Penge 151,456 £629,141 The sum raised under the Precept of the School Board for London, and paid over to that body, was £27,946 6s. 4d. Loans. The total indebtedness of the Board on the Loan account at the 25th March, 1891, was £53,888. During the year the Board paid the sum of £5,527 in reduction of the mortgages owing by them, and raised the sum of £9,000 for New Works and Improvements. The following statement of the loan debt shows the changes made in the same in the six years ended 25th March, 1891, and the amount outstanding at the end of each financial year in that period. The amount outstanding at Lady-day, 1885, was £59,450. Amount paid off during the year. New Loans raised. Net reduction. Net increase. Amount outstanding at the end of the year. £ £ £ £ £ 1885—6 5,428 2,200 3,228 • • • 56,222 1886—7 5,685 3,200 2,485 • • • 53,737 1887—8 6,177 4,847 1,330 • • • 52,407 1888—9 5,349 6,825 ... 1,476 53,883 1889—90 5,768 2,300 3,468 ... 50,415 1890—91 5,527 9,000 ... 3,473 53,888 Net Reduction in the total Debt, £2,334. 11 The following statement indicates the amount borrowed in each period of ten years from 1856 to 1886, and the rate at which the different loans were obtained. From 1856 to 1866 the sum raised was £32,223, at £5 per cent. per annum. In the next period, to the end of 1876, the sum raised was £8,844, and the interest was £5 per cent. at the early put of the decade, and 4½ and 3⅞ at the latter part. Following this, the sum of £68,268 was raised in the ten years ended December, 1886, and the interest was, in the first halt of this period, 4½ and 4½, but in the latter part it was 1 his sum of £68,268 included £24,800 raised for the consolidation of previous loans borrowed at rates of 4¾, 4½, and 4½, and the new loan was obtained, as stated in previous reports, at 3½. The sum therefore raised for new works in the third period, from 1876 to the end of 1886, was £43,468. The sums raised in the second period (i.e., 1866 to 1876) included the loans for the New Offices and for special paving works. The amount borrowed by the Board up to the end of 1886 (exclusive of the sum raised for consolidation of loans) was £163,535 The amount outstanding at Lady-day, 1886, was 56,222 Showing a total payment off the Loan Debt to that date of £107,313 The foregoing statements with regard to the previous Loan transactions of the Board were included in previous reports. The Board again submit the information, believing it to be of considerable interest to the ratepayers of the District. The sum outstanding at Lady-day, 1891, under each rate of interest was as follows:— 4¾ 4½ 4½ 3⅞ 3¾ 3½ Total. £ £ £ £ £ £ £ 300 175 6445 7770 10,800 28,398 53,888 12 The Board's Hospital. There have been but few patients admitted to the Board's Hospital during the year. The establishment has been maintained in a thorough state of readiness in case of any emergency. Residents in the District are invited to use this Hospital should any cases of infectious or contagious disease occur in their families, the charge being only one guinea per week, covering medical attendance, board, lodging and nursing. The Hospital is for non-pauper patients only. Application for admission should be made at the Board's Offices at Catford, where forms of the require certificate and agreement may be obtained. Sanitary Work. Table six in the Medical Officer's Report shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Board and the Committees, and the proceedings taken thereon. There are in so large a district many instances in which nuisances or sanitary defects can only be brought to the notice of the Board or its Officers by the occupiers or persons interested. On receipt of notice from any person of any nuisance or defect the Board's officers will at once attend to the matter, and proceedings will be taken if the defect comes properly within the Board's jurisdiction under the Sanitary Acts. The house to house inspections, under the regulations adopted by the Board as to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, referred to in previous reports, have been continued. During the year there were 221 complaints or requests as to the removal of dust. Personal enquiry was made into each such case. In the majority of cases it was found that the men were not allowed to remove the dust on calling for the same in their regular rounds. These refusals frequently arise in consequence of some little inconvenience to occupiers or their servants at the time of the dustman's call, and as the men cannot call again until their next round, the ashpits 13 main unemptied for a longer period than desirable. The Hoard, by adhering to this regulation, are enabled to carry on this work at a cost of about £3,000 per annum. Any departure from the regulation would greatly increase the cost, to the disadvantage of the ratepayers generally. The Board request all householders to observe the following suggestions:— To see that the men are not refused the dust on calling. To burn (in small quantities at a time) all animal or vegetable refuse. To place no animal or vegetable refuse in the dustbins, unless previously burnt. To cleanse and disinfect, limewash, or limewhite periodically the dustbins. To see that the dustbins are properly constructed, and fitted with covers. To forward complaints of the non-removal of dust to the Board's Offices. Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1880. This Act has been in operation since the 30th October, 1889. During the year ended 25th March, 1891, 335 certificates were sent in by Medical men. Steps have been taken for the disinfection of each house or room where cases occurred, and the articles therein. The Act requires that notice of the infectious diseases therein specified shall be sent to the Medical Officer of Health. The persons called upon to send such notices are— (1) The head of the family to which the patient belongs, and in his default (2) The nearest relatives of the patient present in the house, or being in attendance on the patient, and in default of such relatives 14 (3) Every person in charge of, or in attendance on the patient, and in default of any such person (4) The occupier of the house. The Act also requires that every Medical Practitioner attending on, or called in to visit the patient, shall forthwith, on becoming aware that the patient is suffering from Infectious Disease, send to the Medical Officer of Health a certificate stating the name of the patient, the situation of the house, and the Infectious Disease from which the patient is suffering. Every person required to give a Notice or Certificate as above-mentioned, who fails to give the same, is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 40s. The definition of "Infectious Disease" includes the following diseases:—Small-pox; Cholera; Diphtheria; Membranous Croup; Erysipelas; the disease known as Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever; the fevers known by any of the following names:—Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Relapsing, Continued, or Puerperal. In the early part of the year the Board had occasion to take proceedings against the head of a family for failing to give the notice required. On the hearing of the summons the offence was proved, and the defendant was convicted and fined 5s. and 2s. costs of summons, the Magistrate remarking that he imposed the small penalty the summons being the first under the Act. The Board have from time to time directed special attention to the provisions of this Act, by public announcement and otherwise. Houses let in Lodgings and occupied by more than One Family. The Regulations adopted by the Board under the provisions of the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, are printed in a separate form, and can be obtained at the Board's Offices. The same apply to all houses let in lodgings, with the following exceptions:— 15 (a) Where for the purposes of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 6s. per week: (b) Where for the purposes of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and inclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 7s. 6d. per week. The house to house inspections under these Regulations arc regularly made throughout the District. The following Report (by the Clerk) submitted to the Board in October, 1890, will give full information of their proceedings under these regulations in that year. (8th October, 1890.) "In January last I submitted to you a Report at some length on the subject of the Bye-laws or Regulations adopted by your Hoard, under the Sanitary Acts, in respect of Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by Members of more than one Family, and the Inspections made thereunder. Since that date the Inspections for this year, 1890, have been made, and I am now able to submit to you some particulars of the general results of the same. In the first instance new Registers were obtained, as suggested, from which it appeared that there were 11,293 assessed properties, houses and premises, to be visited— that is to say, premises rated at £30 and under; but a considerable number of these were found to be unoccupied or not used as dwellings. Upon this information your Board authorised the engagement of three inspectors, one for each division of the District. Each Inspector was 16 furnished with a letter showing his authority (for production if required), and was instructed to call at each house on his part of the Register, and to ascertain the name of the occupier, the owner, the number of rooms in the house; the number of families; and how the house was occupied, viz., by 1, 2, or 3 families; and to ascertain, by inquiry and observation, the sanitary defects; reporting each day the result of such visits; and reporting direct and immediately to the Inspector of Nuisances of the division any nuisances or sanitary defects discovered by him, or to which his attention might be drawn. Summaries of these daily reports have been submitted to your Committee at each meeting during the progress of the inspections. And to each Local Committee has been submitted, in the Complaint Books, at each fortnightly meeting, the complaints made, and notices have been served and proceedings taken as ordered thereon. Notices have been served at once in all urgent cases; 1,420 defects have been reported in this way and submitted to the Local Committees. In all cases where the houses were found occupied by members of more than one family, or where it was thought necessary, the Inspector left a notice with the householder calling his attention to the regulations and the necessity for cleansing work. The defects are of the same character as those found on previous inspections, viz., broken and defective water supply apparatus, want of dust-bins, &c., dilapidated dustbins, &c., and are principally matters that some attention and expense on the part of the owners would soon set right. There were also many cases where the premises required whitewashing, cleansing, &c. It may, perhaps, be more convenient to follow the inspections according to the divisions of the District, and in the following tabular form:— 17 Divisions. Total number of Assessments on the Registers. Houses unoccupied, not u.ned as dwellings, or not inspected. Number of houses inspected. How occupied. Number of defects discovered and reported to the Inspectors of Nuisances. One family. Two families. Three families. Blackheath and Lewisham 4385 330 4055 2945 1029 81 400 Sydenham and Forest-hill 4774 420 4354 3560 762 32 518 Penge 2134 291 1843 1477 343 23 502 11,293 1041 10,252 7982 2134 136 1420 A large number of the defects first reported are now remedied. Nearly 700 formal notices were served. Second visits have been, and are being made; and where the defect still exists second notices, before summons, have been served. Considerable correspondence has resulted on the service of these notices and proceedings: the whole tending to obtain the remedy of the matters reported. Further reports have to be made in all cases where the work is not done, and these are from time to time submitted to the Local Committees. This work will be followed up until all the defects reported arc remedied and set right." Bakehouses. These premises have been inspected by the Board's Officers, pursuant to the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1883, under which authority for such inspection is given. Cowhouses and Slaughterhouses. These premises were regularly inspected by the Inspectors. In September the Medical Officer of Health made his inspection prior to the annual licensing by the Justices, when he reported that he found the various premises in a cleanly and satisfactory condition, and saw no reason to oppose the renewal of any of the licenses. Other intermediate applications for licenses have been dealt with. 18 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Proceedings were taken by the Board during the year under these Acts. 123 samples were analysed, 4 were found adulterated or reduced in quality. In one case a summons was applied for and granted, and on the hearing the defendant was convicted and fined 30s. and 2s. costs. In the other cases summonses were not applied for. Strand Improvement Bill. In connection with this Bill the question of the improved value of property was raised under the generally accepted term "Betterment Clauses," that principle having been introduced into the Bill. The Board were called upon to take the matter into their consideration on the 2nd April (Min., par. 13). They passed the following resolution:— "That, in the opinion of this Board, a proposal of the kind referred to, introducing a new principle, should be dealt with, if at all, in a Public Bill, and not in a Bill of a private character." Bromley Road Sewer and Priory Estate Drainage. During the year the Board extended the Main Sewer along the Bromley Road, and constructed Sewers for the drainage of the Estate referred to. The cost of the Main Sewer was apportioned between the Board and the owners of the property, under the provisions of the 53rd sect, of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, and the expenses of the sewers on the Estate were charged to the owners of the property in the several roads. This work is referred to at greater length in the Surveyor's Report. Crystal Palace and District Electric Lighting Order. The proceedings of the Board in relation to this Order were fully explained in last year's report (page 23), and, as then stated, steps were taken by the Board of Trade for obtaining the necessary confirmation of the Order. The matter was reported to the Board, and their proposals having been embodied in the Order as previously reported, no further 19 objection was raised by them in the matter. The Order was duly confirmed, and is embodied in the Act intituled the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (No. 12) Act, 1890. Public Health (London) Law Amendment Bill, and the Public Health (London) Law Consolidation Bill. These Bills have received the consideration of the Board, and the same arc at present before Parliament. Obstructions on Public Footpaths and Highways. During the year proceedings have been taken, under the Police Acts, and the Act 57 George III., cap. 29, for the removal or abatement of obstructions on the public footpaths and highways. In these cases orders were made and penalties inflicted. The greatly increasing population of the District, and the absence of any public market places, has led to the formation of Several trading centres in different parts of the Parish of Lewisham and Hamlet of Penge, where costermongers and other street traders have assembled for the purpose of selling their wares. This kind of street trading has resulted in very serious obstruction to the public thoroughfares, and the Board have been obliged to take steps for preventing the continuance of that annoyance. The Board have also been called upon to take proceedings in numerous cases where shopkeepers have encroached upon the public footways by exposing articles for sale thereon. In all cases cautions and notices are given before proceedings are taken. Gas Examination. The gas supplied by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company is subject to examination by this Board. The Board have received during the year six reports from the Examiner, and the gas upon each occasion has been found to be within the statutory limits as to illuminating power and quality. Underground Rooms. The Board have received during the year the usual 20 reports from the District Surveyors on this subject. From such reports it appears that there are no underground rooms or cellars occupied as dwellings in this District. Roadside Waste. The Board have from time to time taken proceedings for preserving for the public use the pieces of green sward or waste at the road sides. During the year 1890 a piece of waste land near Bromley Hill was enclosed by the owners of an adjoining Estate, and the Board were compelled to take summary proceedings with a view to enforcing their rights in the matter; they were, however, ultimately able to make a satisfactory arrangement with the owners of the property. By such arrangement the owners granted to the Board a piece of ground required for widening the Catford-road, at the corner of Berlin-road, on approved terms, the owners agreed to set back the fence erected by them in the Bromley Road, 30 feet from the centre of that road as required, and the Board withdrew any further objection to the enclosure of the remaining part of the piece of waste in question. Streets in different Parishes. On the joint application of this Board and the Board of Works for the Greenwich District, an order has been made by the London County Council placing Elverson Road (partly in this District and partly in the Greenwich District) under the exclusive management of the Greenwich District Board, that course having been agreed upon between the two Boards. It was also agreed that the cost of the maintenance of the road should be borne in the same proportion as its area in both Districts, viz., one-third by the Greenwich Board, and two-thirds by the Lewisham Board. The road will, in the first instance, be paved and formed as a "New Street" at the cost of the owners. South Eastern Metropolitan Tramway. During the year this Tramway was constructed pursuant to the Act obtained by the Promoters in 1888. The line was 21 formally inspected by Major-Gen. Hutchinson on the 5th August, 1890, and was shortly afterwards opened to the public. During the progress of the work the matter was constantly under the consideration of the Board on reports of the officers. The cost of the supervision of the works by the Board's Inspectors was paid by the Promoters. Lewisham Churchyard. This Churchyard and Ground has been taken over by the Board, and they have undertaken to maintain and preserve the same as an Open Space and Recreation Ground accessible to the public and under the control of the Board, pursuant to the Metropolitan Open Spaces Acts. The Board have duly made and confirmed live-laws for the management of the Ground, pursuant to those Acts for that purpose. The Annual Inspection. The Board, according to the usual custom, made their Annual Inspection of the District this year on the 27th June. The Pariah of Lewisham is divided into three Wards, returning in all 21 Members, and the Hamlet of Penge returning 6 Members; and it may be imagined that the Members thus returned in many instances are not well acquainted with the other parts of the District, therefore it has been found of the utmost use that each Member should, at least once a year, visit the different parts of this widely-extended District, and be able to inspect the various works in progress or in contemplation. On the Inspection the Board viewed the greater part of the works and improvements effected in the previous year, and the sites of the new works provided for in the current year's Estimates, the various New Streets then recently paved and formed, and other works in contemplation. The Inspection occupied the whole of the day, commencing at Blackheath and terminating at Anerley Hill in the Hamlet of Penge. 22 Shortlands and Nunhead Railway. The Act authorising the construction of this Railway, and the proceedings leading up to the passage of the Act through both Houses of Parliament, were referred to in the Board's last Report. The Railway Company commenced the construction of their line in the early part of the year, and the Board have had before them, upon different occasions, the drawings of the various Bridges on the Railway submitted for their approval, in accordance with clause 9 of the Act. The designs of the Bridges have also been approved by the London County Council. The Bridges are of an ornamental description, and the Board have, in all cases, been able to grant their sanction to the same. Houses unfit for habitation. Proceedings were taken by the Board with reference to certain cottages in the Parish of Lewisham, which were reported by the Medical Officer of Health to be in such a condition as to be unfit for human habitation, and an order was made by the Magistrate, at the Greenwich Police Court, prohibiting the use of the cottages for habitation until they were rendered fit for the purpose. The owner permitted the cottages to be again occupied without obtaining the permission of the Court, and a further summons was applied for in the matter, and on the hearing of the same, on the 14th October, the owner was fined £20 and the costs of the summons. Further proceedings were rendered unnecessary as the buildings were shortly afterwards taken down by the owner. Depot at Molesworth Street and the Works for the Relief from Floods. When the Board, some years ago, carried out certain improvements in the River Ravensbourne for facilitating the flow of water in storms, they desired to make a new overflow from the river, above the Lewisham Bridge Mills and near Molesworth Street, but they were unable to obtain the ground they required. 23 The Board were, in August, able to obtain an offer for tho sale of the ground to them at a reasonable price, having regard to the difficulty of obtaining land for the purpose in the locality. The Board agreed to pay the sum of £2360 for the land referred to, consisting of about four acres, and the negotiations for the completion of the purchase were proceeded with, and tho purchase was completed in March of this year, 1891. The greater part of the purchase-money, viz., £2,200, was raised by Loan, with the consent of the London County Council. The Council advanced the amount at £3 10s. per cent. per annum, the principal to be repaid in 50 years. (See statement of Loans, Loan No. 80). The Board have thereby acquired a very valuable site for a depot for their general purposes, in addition to the land they require for the improved outlet for storm waters. The Board have also been able to proceed with the consideration of tho scheme for improving the surface drainage of the locality of Stanstead, St. Germans, and Brockley Roads, Forest Hill, and at the time of the writing of this Report tho plans and sections of that scheme, for the approval of the London County Council, are in preparation. Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Act, 1890. This Act came into operation in the Metropolis on the 4th December, 1890. The Act confers important powers and duties on the Local Authorities in regard to the following matters:— (a) The inspection of dairies and the prohibition of the supply of milk therefrom in cases where it appears that infectious disease is attributable to or likely to be caused by the consumption of milk so supplied: (b) The cleansing and disinfection of premises, bedding, clothing, &c., for the purpose of preventing or checking infectious disease; (c) The detention, removal and burial of the bodies of persons who have died from infectious disease; (d) The detention in hospital of persons suffering from 24 tious disease who would, oil leaving the hospital, be without proper lodging; and (c) The provision of temporary shelter and attendance for members of families who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of the dwellings being disinfected by the Local Authority. The Act also gives further and extended powers in relation to other similar matters. The Board gave notice of the Act in the District by public announcement, and steps have been taken for giving effect to the same. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890. This Act also came into operation during the year, and relates more particularly, so far as this Board are concerned, to the exemption of certain houses from Inhabited House Duty. Section 26, clause 2, provides:—That the assessment to inhabited house duty of any house originally built or adapted by additions or alterations and used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding for each dwelling the rate of seven shillings and sixpence a week, and occupied only by persons paying such rents, is to be discharged by the Commissioners acting in the execution of the Acts relating to the inhabited house duties, provided that a certificate is produced to them to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements. The certificate is to be obtained from the Medical Officer of Health for the District in which the house is situate, or from some other Medical Practitioner appointed as in the Act mentioned. The Act makes it the duty of the Medical Officer of Health of a district, on request by the person who would be liable to pay the house duty on any house in the District, if the duty were not discharged by the Commissioners, to examine the house for the purpose of ascertaining whether a certificate can properly be given; and if the house is 25 structed so as to afford suitable accommodation for each of tho families or persons inhabiting it, and due provision is made for their sanitary requirements, he must certify the same accordingly. Tho Act docs not empower a Medical Officer of Health to charge any fee for a certificate under it. The Medical Officer has been called upon to make one or two certificates only under this Act since it has been in force. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. This Act came into operation on the 18th August, 1890, and it has received the careful consideration of this Board; but during tho year now under review no reports or representations have been made rendering it necessary for them to take proceedings under it. The Board in December, 1890, took part in a Conference between the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London Connty Council and Delegates from Vestries and District Boards, held at the County Hall, Spring Gardens. Upon that occasion the Board were represented by Mr. Williams, their Chairman, and Mr. Jerrard, the Chairman of tho Works and General Purposes Committee, and the Clerk and Medical Officer. The Meetings of the Conference were held on the 5th December, 1890, and the 5th January, 1891. At the first Meeting certain resolutions were carried, referring it to the Medical Officers to report generally on the subject, submitting, if practicable, a list or schedule of the defects which might be considered to render a house so "dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation." Mr. Jerrard submitted to the Board, on the 4th Feb., 1891, a copy of the Report submitted and laid before the Conference by the Medical Officers at the second Meeting, and also stated the further proceedings thereat, in which he advocated a house to house inspection of small tenements, as carried out in this District. The matter was not proceeded with, and the Meeting terminated and the Conference closed without any special result. 26 The Lewisham Recreation Ground. In their last Report the Board referred to a letter from the London County Council, dated the 27th February, 1890, stating, in reply to an enquiry by this Board as to the formation and laying out of the Ground, that the Council could not obtain possession of the whole of the ground until the 25th March, 1890, and that the question of dealing with it would be deferred until after that date. In November (1890) the Board wrote again to the Council in the matter, and in reply received information as to the works intended to be carried out this year. The estimated cost of these works amounted to £1,420, including £700 for the bridge over the South Eastern Railway. The Board were greatly disappointed to find that the Council proposed thus to limit their expenditure in laying out the ground, more particularly as the Council stated a much larger outlay was contemplated in the early part of the year. The Board understand that an expenditure of £4,500 was then advised. Under that estimate the ground would doubtless have been laid out in a more fitting manner. When the Shortlands and Nunhead Railway Bill was before Parliament it was admitted that the ground was considered a matter of Metropolitan importance, as it was the only ground available in the part of the District for a Recreation Ground. And it was further stated that there were natural features about the ground which were of very considerable beauty, and that it wa3 capable of being laid out in a very satisfactory manner. The Board are still in communication with the Council on the subject, and they hope that the Council may yet see its way to revert to the original scheme for laying out and completing the ground, in order that the public may enjoy its full advantage. 27 Street Nomenclature. The following streets were renumbered during the year— Cintra Park. Crystal Palace Park Road. Hamlet Road. Longton Grove. Wheathill Road. An Order was also made including the short piece of road leading from Longton Grove to Taylor's Lane, Sydenham, with Longton Avenue in continuation of the road of that name. Parliamentary. The only Parliamentary notice deposited with the Board in November, related to a proposal of the South Eastern Railway Company in respect of additional lands to be acquired by them in Morley and Sunninghill Roads, and Beaufort Gardens, Lewisham. The Board were not called upon to take any action in relation to this matter, as the proposal did not appear to affect in any way the roads or sewers vested in the Board. The Unemployed. In January (16th) the Board received a letter from the President of the Local Government Board, as follows:— "The Local Government Hoard have had under their consideration the distress of many persons of the working class in the Metropolis, in consequence of the want of employment which has been occasioned by the recent severity of the weather. "The Board deem it right, under the circumstances which now exist, to bring the subject under the special attention of the Vestries and District Boards, and to suggest for their consideration whether if there are any works required for their District which in the ordinary course would be deferred until a later period of the year, it may not be desirable, where practicable, to commence them at an early date, in order that the much needed employment may be given. 28 "The Board may also suggest that additional labour in street cleansing might, in many cases be employed with great advantage. Work of this kind obviously affords appropriate employment for unskilled labour." "As the Board have previously suggested, when such employment is given by the Vestry or District Board, it would usually be an advantage if they acted in concert with the Board of Guardians, and the Guardians were afforded the opportunity of recommending for employment persons who, from their previous circumstances and condition, it is most desirable should not be placed under the necessity of receiving relief at the cost of the rates. "If this suggestion commends itself to the Local Authority it would no doubt be useful if some personal conference were to take place between the members of the Authority and of the Board of Guardians, with the view of facilitating the necessary arrangements. "The Board trust that the Vestries and District Boards will be so good as to give this communication their early consideration, and the Board will be glad to be informed of the result." and the Board replied (22nd January) stating— "The subject has not escaped the notice of this Board, and they would gladly advance any works in their District in the manner suggested by you, but for the fact that it is impracticable to proceed with the work of ordinary road repair, paving, and other similar work while the weather continues so severe. The only work possible is additional street cleansing, in sweeping and removing snow, &c., and the question is how many extra men may properly be employed in this work, seeing that the whole of the Board's ordinary staff of workmen are available for the same, and in fact cannot be otherwise employed. This Board have, however, been able to find work for a considerable number of extra men in the recent snow and frost, and they continue to hire as many men as they can properly find work for. Yesterday 176 extra men were employed in the District, and a large sum has been expended in this extra labour. 29 "In the early part of 1886, when very great distress prevailed, this Board advanced several New Street paving works for the benefit of the unemployed, and the Board's proceedings at that time were fully explained to you in their letter of the 16th March, 1886, to which I am directed to refer you. The Board had not, however, at that time such severe weather to contend with. "The Board arc not aware that there is any lack of work in the District, except that occasioned by the severe weather, and in fact there arc some important railway and contract works recently proceeding, but partially stopped, and the Board's general paving works are in a like manner at a standstill in consequence of the severe frost." With regard to the suggestion in Mr. Ritchie's letter for concerted action with the Guardians, the Board explained the fact that they each year, by arrangement with the Guardians, furnished a quantity of granite spalls for breaking in the labour yard. The Board submit this correspondence as indicating the action taken by them in this matter during an abnormally severe winter. The Overhead Wires Bill. The subject of this Bill received the consideration of the Board during the year, and in February the Board presented a petition to the Local Government Board, of which a copy is appended, see page 28. The Bill is at present before Parliament. The clauses relating to Subways were omitted from the Bill at an early stage. Tents, Vans, Sheds, &c. The attention of the Board was called to a number of gipsies encamping in vans and sheds on enclosed ground at Ladywell, in the occupation of a farmer there. The Board were informed that the land was let to the occupiers of the tents at a weekly or other rental, and that so far as could be ascertained no sufficient sanitary accommodation was provided for the occupiers. The Board therefore, to meet the case, 30 decided to make Bye-laws under the 9th section of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, empowering them to make Bye-laws for promoting cleanliness in and the habitable condition of tents, vans, sheds, and similar structures used for human habitation, and for preventing the spread of infectious disease by persons inhabiting such tents, &c., and generally for the prevention of nuisances in connection with the same. The Bye-laws were duly made and confirmed, and received the approval of One of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State on the 22nd May, 1891. The same are now in force in the District. General Subjects. The Board, during the year, received and dealt with numerous letters from Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards and other Boards, relating to matters of general interest in the Metropolis. The Board also made and furnished Returns required by the Local Government Board as to the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board, and a Return called for by Parliament under the following Order:— Copy Order of the House of Commons referred to. "Ordered, that there be laid before this House, a Return of Salaries, Fees, or other Emoluments received by the the Officers and their Assistants in the employment of the various Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, and the "Woolwich Local Board of Health, during the year ended on the 25th day of March, 1889, in the discharge of their official duties under the Metropolis Management Acts, or of any duty imposed on them by any other Public or Local Act." The Board have also received and dealt with a large number of letters generally relating to numerous and varied subjects affecting the District, and the lighting, cleansing, and improvement of the same. Meetings of the Board and Committee. There were in all 141 Meetings held during the year, 31 viz., 22 Ordinary Meetings of the Board and one Special Meeting; 21 Meetings of the Works and General Purposes Committee; 11 Ordinary Monthly Meetings of the Finance Committee; and 22 Fortnightly Meetings held immediately before the Board Meetings; 20 Meetings of the Local Committee of Blackheath and Lewisham; 21 Meetings of the Sydenham and Forest Hill Local Committee; and 23 Meetings of the Penge Local Committee. Attendances of Members of the Board. The total number of attendances of Members of the Board at Board and regular Committee Meetings, held between the 25th March, 1890, and the 25th March, 1891, is given in the statement appended hereto. By Order, EDWD. WRIGHT, Clerk to the Board. The Board's Offices, Catford, s.e., June, 1891. 32 To the Local Government Board. The Petition of the Board of Works for the Lewisham District under their Common Seal. Sheweth,— 1. That your Petitioners are the Board of Works for the Lewisham District, constituted under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. That although the control and management of the roads, streets, and sewers within that District are vested in your Petitioners, there are powers vested in various Companies which authorise them to break up or disturb the streets and pavements, and this involves not only unnecessary and frequent expense, but is also injurious to the surface of the streets, and causes obstruction and inconvenience to traffic. 2. That your Petitioners are of opinion that the public interests require that the control over the streets and pavements shall be so vested in your Petitioners, aud the various other local authorities in the Metropolis, as to enable them to make proper regulations as to the breaking up or disturbing of the streets and pavements in their several districts. 3. That your Petitioners are informed that Subways already exist in certain streets, and your Petitioners are of opinion that it is expedient that further power should be conferred for making and maintaining other Subways in streets, and that provisions should be made requiring that such Subways should be used for the reception of pipes, wires, and the like, instead of such streets being from time to time thus broken up and interfered with. 4. That your Petitioners observe that the number of wires and cables placed overhead has greatly increased and is still increasing in many Districts in the Metropolis, and it is suggested that such wires and cables involve danger to persons using the streets and injury and inconvenience to buildings, and that such overhead wires and cables are subject to no efficient system of control or regulation. 5. That your Petitioners consider that additional powers should be conferred for the control and regulation of all such wires. 33 6. That your Petitioners therefore urgently press upon your Honourable Board to insert a clause or clauses embodying the above suggestions in any Bill that may be introduced into Parliament for the creation of District Councils, and that such District Councils should be the Local Authorities for the purposes aforesaid. And your Petitioners will ever pray, &c. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District.

REPORT TO The Board of works for the lewisham district TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1890, By Dr. S. BLAKE JOLLY, Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The sanitary condition of the Lewisham District during the year 1890 has been eminently satisfactory. There has been a slight rise in the death rate, but this has been due to causes which have raised the death rate for 1890 over the whole kingdom. Those causes were, in the first place, the Influenza epidemic, which accounted, both directly and indirectly, for a large increase in the number of deaths at the beginning of the year; and, secondly, the intense cold during the last part of the year, which was fatal in many instances to both very young and very old persons. Notwithstanding these unfavourable conditions, the death rate for the district during 1890 was 13.9 per 1000, which compares favourably not only with that of the other outlying districts of London, but also with that of most of the principal health resorts. 2 There has been no epidemic of infectious disease during the year; and in spite of the large number of diphtheria cases in London, and the fatal epidemic of the same disease in our near neighbourhood of Croydon, there have been only 49 cases reported during the year, and only 11 deaths. This, I think, we may consider speaks well for the drainage and sanitary condition of the District. Population. The population of the Lewisham District, as estimated at the middle of the year 1890, amounted to 94,458, occupying 15,094 houses, as compared with 90,812 occupying 14,503 houses in the previous year. The population at the census in 1881,was ascertained to be 71,715. BIRTHS. The registered births in the District in the year 1890 amounted to 2,259. This number is GO less than the previous year, and also less than any year since 1881. Of the births 75, or 3'3 per cent., were illegitimate. Males 1,155 Females 1,104 The birth rate to the population was 23 9 per 1,000. In London it was 29T per 1,000. This is the lowest birth rate yet recorded for London, the rate having fallen continuously year by year since 1879, when it was 35 5 per 1,000. The birth rate in England and Wales was 29.7, per 3 1,000 living, being as much as 2.9 per 1,000 below the average rate in the preceding 10 years. The birth rate has now experienced a continous decline since 1879. 1 hen it was 36.3, compared with which the rate of last year shows a decline of no less than 18.2 per cent. Deaths. The number of deaths registered in the District for the year 1890 was 1,320, being 194 more than the number registered during the previous year, when the death rate was unprecedentedly low. Males 639 Females 681 The death rate was 13.9 per 1,000. The number of deaths in Public Institutions amounted to 144, an increase of 5 on the previous year. Lewisham workhouse 96 deaths. St. John's Hospital, Blackheath 17 „ Koine for Sick Children, Sydenham . 10 „ North Surrey District Schools 12 „ AVaterman's Asylum, Penge 9 ,, During the same period the death rate in England and Wales, which in the two previous years had been unprecedentedly low, viz., 17.8 and 17.9, rose to 19.2. This rate, however, is lower than that of any year prior to 1881. The death rate of London was 20.3. This rate was higher than any one of the five preceding years, and was an interruption to the almost unbroken fall in the London mor- 4 tality which began in 1879. The death rate of the "Outer King" of suburban districts, did not exceed 16.5. The death rate in the twenty-eight great towns, with an aggregate population of close on ten millions, varied greatly, ranging between 16.5 in Nottingham and 30.6 in Manchester. Zymotic Disease. The number of deaths from Zymotic Disease was 42 more than in the previous year. Measles—The number of deaths from this disease was 34, as compared with 21 deaths in the year before. Whooping Cough—53 deaths as compared with 23 for 1889. Diphtheria—11 deaths as compared with 5 for 18b9. Scarlet Fever—4 deaths as compared with 9 for 1889. Diarrhoea—29 deaths against 34 for 1889. Typhoid—11 deaths as compared with G for 1889. For the fifth successive year there was no fatal case of small-pox. The deaths from Phthisis were slightly fewer, while there was an increase of 68 from other diseases of the respiratory organs, for which result the epidemic of Influenza is mainly responsible. Notification of Infectious Diseases Act. During the year 1890 there has been a good opportunity of testing the working of this Act. It has greatly added to 5 the work of the Sanitary department, especially to that of the Inspectors of Nuisances, who have carried out their work in a very able and energetic manner. It has shown itself a moat important step in the right direction, making the sanitary authorities immediately acquainted with the extent and locality of any infectious disease in our midst. The more one sees of the working of the Act, however, the more one feels that it falls short in one particular, viz., that the Removal of Infectious Cases is not compulsory in all cases where the Medical Officer may think the proceeding necessary for the safety of the surrounding neighbourhood. This addition to the Act will, however, I trust, be made in the course of time, and the Act will then render any general epidemic of infectious disease almost practically impossible. The Notifications to mo of infectious diseases in this District for 1890 were as follows:— Small-pox 1 Diphtheria 49 Membranous Croup 5 Erysipelas 36 Scarlet Fever 228 Enteric Fever 30 Puerperal Fever 3 Relapsing Fever 1 Total of infectious cases reported 353 Inquests. Coroner's inquests were held in 57 cases of death under peculiar circumstances 6 The causes of death were returned as follows:—Natural causes 30. The remaining 27 were violent deaths, of which 24 were returned as accidental, 3 as suicidal. Twenty-eight deaths were registered as "Not Certified," no formal inquest being considered necessary by the Coroner after inquiry into the circumstances. Marriages. During the year 1890 there were 445 Marriages in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 337 were solemnised in the various Churches, 34 in Dissenting Chapels, and 74 at the Registrar's Office. During the same period there were 131 marriages in the Hamlet of Penge, of which 109 were solemnised in Churches, 11 in Dissenting Chapels, and 11 at the Registrar's Office. Total 576, as compared with 538 in 1889. The marriage rate was equal to 12.1 persons married per 1,000 of estimated population. In London it was 16.6 per 1,000, a somewhat higher rate than in any of three preceding years, but otherwise the lowest recorded since civil registration began. In England and Wales it was equal to 15.1 per 1000 ; a slightly higher rate than has occurred during the last six years. Meteorology. The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich in 1890 was 48.6. 7 The highest reading by day, 82.8, was registered in August, and the lowest reading by night, 13.1, in March. Rain fell on 1G2 days. The total amount of rainfall was 21.9 inches, or three inches below the average for the last seventy-five years. I am, Gentlemen, Faithfully yours, S. BLAKE JOLLY, Medical Officer of Health to the Lewi-sham District. 8 TABLE I. Population, Inhabited Houses, Births, Deaths, and Marriages. (GROSS NUMBERS).

The Board of works for the Lewisham District SURVEYOR'S REPORT Of Work executed from Lady-day, 1890, to Lady-day, 1891. Gentlemen, I beg to submit this my Twenty-second Annual Report on the works executed and the general business transacted in my department during the past financial year. HIGHWAYS. The quantity of material used for the maintenance of the public Roads in the District is shewn in the following Table:— Division. Broken Guernsey Granite. Port Philip Stone. Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Parish (cubic yds.) 2670 1487 ... 2411 1548 8016 Hamlet of penge (ditto) 883 ... 615 ... 646 2144 Total 3453 1487 615 2411 2194 10,160 The rainfall, as registered at the Forest Hill Stoneyard, from the 26th March, 1890, to the 25th March, 1891, inclusive, was:— Number of days on which snow or rain fell INCHES. 0 1890 March 26th to 31st, inclusive 0.00 19 „ April 1.62 11 „ May 1.87 16 „ June 2.84 16 „ July 4.49 15 „ August 2.04 5 „ September 0.51 11 „ October 1.08 20 „ November 1.56 14 „ December 0.14 11 „ February 1.19 0 „ February 0.00 11 „ March, 1st to 25th inclusive 1.52 Total 149 Total 18.36 The rainfall was 4.2 inches less, and snow or rain fell on 4 days fewer, this year than last. During the winter there were seven 2 snowstorms, some of which were of considerable severity. The snow, and the long continuance of frost, entailed a great amount of additional work and expenditure. Four thousand eight hundred and sixty-three cubic yards of ashes, sand, burnt ballast, and in fact any suitable material I was able to obtain, were spread on the roads and footpaths during the frosts. The total additional cost was £1,582. The amount of snow, and the severity of the frosts, were greater than have been experienced for many years; and in over twenty years I have never used in one year anything like this quantity of material in frosty weather. A large number of the unemployed were set to work in clearing the paths, &c., of snow. On account of the continuous frost the usual amount of material could not be put on some of the roads, and in consequence they are not at present in as good condition as I should like to see them. ROAD WATERING. In the Blackheath Division the Road Watering was carried out by horses and drivers supplied by Mr. J. C. Pickernell, at a contract price of 9s. per horse, harness and driver per day; in the Lewisham Division the work was done chiefly by the Board's own horses and men, assisted, when required, by men and horses supplied under contract by Mr. G. Sabin at 7s. Gd. per day. Mr. W. Stimpson supplied the horses, men and harness in the Upper Sydenham and Forest Hill, and Lower Sydenham Divisions at 7s. 9d. and 7s. Gd. respectively. In the Hamlet of Penge the horses and drivers were supplied by Mr. R. Winnifrith at a contract price of 8s. per day. The length of roads watered was as follows:— Locality. Miles. Yards. Parish of Lewisham 60 961 Hamlet of Penge 12 700 Total Lewisham District 62 1651 STREET LIGHTING.

For some years past I have drawn attention in my annual reports to the difficulty of disposing of the dust, and it is now three years since any was sold, from which time until this last year I have been able, with some difficulty, to find free shoots. During last year, however, the Board have been obliged to pay a small sum for shooting some of the dust, and at the present time there appears to be every probability of having to expend a considerable sum for the disposal of the dust, ashes, &c., during the current year. The horses and harness in the Blackheath and Lewisham Division were supplied by Mr. G. Sabin, at 4s. 9d. per horse per day; in the Sydenham and Forest-hill Division Mr. W. Stimpson supplied the horses and harness at 4s. Gd. per day,—the Board finding carts, men and boys. 6 The following Table shews the manner in which the dust was disposed of:— Locality. To who supplied. Ox what Terms Supplied. Blackheath and Lewisham Division Mr. W. Appleby Given. Mr. W. Jerrard „ Mr. D. Phillips „ Mr. Umfreville „ M r.

The difficulty of obtaining shoots for the Dust was also experienced in the Hamlet of Penge, and fur some of the Dust a free shoot could not be found. The horses, carts and harness were supplied by Mr. R. Winnifrith, at 5s. per day each,—the men and boys being in the ment of the Board. The dust was disposed of as follows:— Locality. To whom supplied. On what terms Supplied. Penge Beckenham and Penge Brickworks Company The Board paid 6d. per load for part and part was taken gratis. Beckenham Local Board Given.

The following Table shows the number of Houses sanctioned to be built and drained, and number of gullies, manholes, ventilators, and flushing chambers constructed in existing Sewers during the year:— 11 Total Hamlet of Penge Lewisham Parish Description of Works. 328 19 309 No. of Houses sanctioned to be Built and Drained. 241 29 212 No. of Houses &c., sanctioned to be Drained. 86 15 71 No. of Additionsto Buildings functioned. 446 24 422 No. of Dwelling Houses and Public Buildings, &c.completed within the year 134 9 125 No. of Prontage Drains laid. 6 3 3 No. of Gulliesconstructed in Public Roads. 0 0 0 No. of pipe Ventilators constructed in old sewers. 21 6 16 No. of Marholes acting asFlushing Chamberand Ventilators constructed in old sewers. 12 6 16 No. of self acting Flushing Chambersconstructed in old sewer. 12 3 9 No. of small manholes acting as ventilators constructed adjoining flushing tanks.

The following Table gives the number of Flushing Tanks at work at the present time. There are 73 in Lewisham and 20 in Penge—a total of 93. This is a large number. I do not think any District in the Metropolitan area has so many. The old-fashioned tilt action flusher in Blythe Vale, which was put in in 1883, and was the first automatic flushing apparatus used in the District, has been superseded by a syphon, the tilt box being worn out. The collective discharge of these tanks amounts 13 to, in Lewisham, 59,180 gallons, and in Penge 18,915 gallons of water. This large quantity of water will give a good idea of the amount of flushing that goes on automatically in the District night and day, and which I venture to say few people are aware of: Parish of Lewisham.

The following disinfectants were used in Hushing gullies, disinfecting dust bins, urinals, &c. Permanganate of Potash 8 cwts. Sanitas Powder 7 tons. Jeyes' Perfect Purifier 128 gallons. Carbolic Acid 30 „ Carbolic Powder 1 ton. Cost, about £169. With regard to the Forest Hill Brewery Company discharging hot washings of barrels, &c., into the Perry Vale Sewer, a large tank has been constructed in order to collect and cool them, and there is every reason to believe it will prove successful. One of the most important matters connected with Sewerage was the completion of the 3ft. 9in. by 2ft. 4in. egg-shaped sewer along the Bromley Road, and also the completion of the drainage of the Priory Estate. All the cesspools are now destroyed and the houses drained into the sewer. I need hardly say this is a good thing done, remembering the opposition that was offered and the difficulties that had to be overcome before it could be accomplished. The flushere have also been engaged in tracing and finding the position of stoppages in drains prior to serving notices, in a large number of cases. The sewers vested in the Board have been periodically inspected, cleansed, and Hushed during the year; and I can say with confidence they never were in such a good condition as they are at the present time. Although this work is unseen, it is of the first importance, and deserves the first consideration. RECREATION GROUNDS, &c., &c. The Churchyard of St. Mary's, Lewisham, was taken over and will be henceforth maintained by the Board. Its area is about two acres, and it is very much used. Two of the open spaces along the Bromley Road, at Rushey Green, were levelled and returfed, and a few shrubs planted. The work will be extended this year. What has been done is a great improvement, and 1 believe fully appreciated by the public. The "Crooked Billet" enclosure at Penge, was remodelled, a light iron railing erected in place of the oak fence, the shrubs 16 removed, and the space laid down in grass with a few shrubs and flowers. SHORTLANDS AND NUNHEAD RAILWAY. The works on this Railway are being rapidly proceeded with. At the present time none of the road approaches to bridges are completed. The elevations of the public road bridges were submitted to the Board for approval, as provided in the Act. All the over bridges will have steel girders, with ornamental columns, where the span exceeds 40 feet on the square. A system has been adopted which I have always advocated, viz., laying the permanent way over the bridges on the ordinary transverse sleepers, packed underneath with ballast. I believe this will deaden the sound of passing trains very much. It is proposed to have four stations in the Lewisham District, viz., Brockley, Catford, Bellingham, and Beckenham Hill. There will also be another station nearer Shortlands, just out of the District, on the Cator Estate, which is to be named Ravensbourne. I expect the line will be opened early next year, and I think it cannot fail to be useful to the public. SOUTH EASTERN METROPOLITAN TRAMWAY. This Tramway, which commences at South Street, Greenwich, and terminates opposite the Black Horse p.h., Rushey Green, Catford, was constructed during the year. The work was not commenced until June, and as it had to be completed by the 7th August, had to be pushed on rapidly. It took up a good deal of my time. The Board of Trade Inspector passed the line on the 5th August, and it has been opened for some time. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. The only Bill deposited during the year was for acquiring additional land in Morley Road, Sunninghill Road, and Beaufort Gardens for the purposes of the South Eastern Railway. I hear nothing of this Company widening their main line or carrying out their pledge by building a station at Further Green. FLOODING, FRONTAGE LINES, ROAD IMPROVEMENTS, &c. A piece of ground at the back of Molesworth Street, containing nearly four acres was purchased by the Board. This will 17 give an opportunity of carrying out the long projected overflow for flood water from the Ravensbonrne at this point. The remaining portion of the ground will be used as a much wanted Depot for road material, &c. At the time of writing this report I am engaged in making drawings of the overflow, cottage for caretaker, and other matters connected with it. The recently constructed storm water relief works in Penge have done good service during the year. I am now preparing reports, estimates, and plans for similar surface water outlets in Stanstead Road. The. roadway at the Crooked Billet p.h., in Penge, was widened, and an improvement was made in the road and footpath at the corner of Beckenham Road and Kent House Road. An improvement was also made in the road and footway near the Duke of Cambridge p.h., Lewisham, during the construction of the South Eastern Metropolitan Tramways. There were 20 communications received from the Superintending Architect of the County Council requesting suggestions on frontage lines, under the 75th and other sections of the Metropolis Local Management Act. I reported on them, and the annexed table will show the result of such applications. Eighty statutory notices were sent to builders and others for commencing to build before giving notice. Several summonses were taken out and convictions obtained for this and other offences. Some trees were planted along the public roads, and additional name plates put up. During the year one hundred and forty-nine drawings and tracings were made in my office, and a large number of estimates, specifications, and reports prepared, and many letters written. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst., Surveyor to the Board. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District.
