REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD FOR THE YEAR 1873-74, and REPORTS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER AND SURVEYOR; Also Accounts in Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board during the same period. Printed in accordancc with section 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, (18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120,) and ordered to be circulated among the Inhabitants of the District. In May, 1873, the Board advertised for new contracts for scavenging and dusting for a term of three years, the then existing ones having nearly expired, and tenders were received from various Contractors for the execution of the work; the lowest being as under:— Cleansing and Dusting. Mr. Boakes, Cleansing St. Saviour's £1,300 per annum. Mrs. Easton, Cleansing Christchurch £1,580 ,, ,, Collection of Dust, whole District, £700 ,, These prices being greatly in excess of the previous rates, the Board declined to let the work for the period intended, and, with the consent of the parties, extended the old contracts for three months only at the enhanced prices; referring it to a Special 4 Committee to consider whether a better arrangement could not be made for the execution of such work. Subsequently the same contracts were further extended for a period of six months, viz., to the 1st March, 1874. During this interval, the Special Committee very fully and carefully investigated the question referred to them; but not finding themselves in a position to advise the Board to undertake the work, they reported to that effect, and recommended that advertisements for fresh contracts for a further period of twelve months should be issued. This was done, and on the 25th February last the following tenders, amongst others, were received, those of Mr. Reddin being the lowest:— roadways and roadways footways. only. Mr. Reddin, Cleansing St. Saviour's £1,400 £1,070. ,, ,, Christchurch £1,200 £1,000. ,, Collection of Dust, whole District £690 These prices being considerably under the previous tenders, the Board agreed to accept Mr. Reddin's offers for the whole of the work, including the cleansing of footways, which hitherto had not been stipulated for; they also accepted an offer from him to supply water-carts, drivers, and men, at 9s. 6d. per set per diem, and contracts were shortly afterwards entered into accordingly. ???bulation For the purpose of preserving and perpetuating the right of way which the public possess over various passages and places in the District, now closed and disused, mostly situate at the water-side, a perambulation was, on the 6th November last, made of the same by members of the Paving and General Purposes Committee, accompanied by a number of boys from the Parochial Schools in the neighbourhood; and a record of the condition of the several localities visited was afterwards entered in the books. ???vement ???de. In order to effect a desirable improvement, the Board has consented to pay Messrs. Meux & Co., the owners of the "Three Compasses" public-house, Bankside, £100, on re-building and setting back those premises. Towards this cost the Metropolitan Board will contribute £50. 5 In compliance with the earnestly expressed desire of Inhabitants of Cross Street, Blackfriars Road, the Board has had the carriageway of that Street paved with wood. It has also, on application made by the Guardians of St. Saviour's Union, had a portion of John Street West, contiguous to their public offices, paved with wood; and, on a like application from the Trustees of St. Saviour's Parochial Schools in Union Street, has had the roadway in front and at the side thereof in Red Cross Street similarly paved; the stones taken up being in each case transferred to and laid in other localities where repairs were necessary. These several works were executed by Mr. Carey, the well-known Wood Pavior, and the cost was as under: — Cross Street £388 12s. 2d. John Street West £273 2s. 6d. Union Street £445 14s. 3d. Wood Paving. In consequence of notice given by the Phoenix Gas Company in December last of its intention to raise the price of Gas after the then current quarter to 4s. 6d. per 1000 feet, and the general dissatisfaction caused by the recent action of the London Gas Companies, the Board has appointed a Committee, consisting of Messrs. Sutton, Dunn, King, and Stannah, to confer with other District Boards and Vestries on this question; and has joined in a Memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works by the Vestries and Boards of Lambeth, Newington, St. Olave's, and Lewisham, which was presented on the 22nd ult., praying for an inquiry as to how far the London Gas Companies comply with the provisions of the 10th Vict., cap. 15, and also whether the circumstances at the present time justify the increase in price. Price of Gas. The whole of the sum of £2,000, borrowed in the year 1864 of the Provident Clerks' Assurance Association to defray the expense of paving Stamford Street, has been repaid by annual instalments of £200; a balance of £1,400 is however still owing to the Society in respect of a second Loan of £2,000, as will be seen on reference to page 34; and a fresh Loan of £3,000 has been obtained of the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, for enabling this Board B Loans. 6 to complete the paving of the carriage-way in the Blackfriars Road, as far as the Parish boundary. This work has been completed, and the new Loan will bear Interest at 3¾ per cent, per annum. The principal money is repayable, by annual instalments of £200, in fifteen years. Annuities. The last of the Annuities payable by the Board as successors of the late Clink Commissioners for money advanced to that Trust, has lapsed by the death, in September last, of Mrs. Hagbergh, who was in receipt of £28 per annum. Mr. Haddock, formerly Collector to the Commissioners of Borough Pavements, another Trust succeeded to by this Board, has also lately died, and the Annuity of £10 8s. 1d. paid to him in compensation for loss of office, will lapse on payment to his representatives of any balance which may have been due at the time of his decease. Mr. Sturmy's Resignation. At the Meeting of this Board held on the 31st December last, Mr. Sturmy intimated his desire to retire from the office of Clerk to the Board, a position which he had ably and satisfactorily filled since its establishment in the year 1855. The Board, being unwilling to accept his resignation, under a hope that he might be able to resume his duties, deferred the consideration of the subject for awhile. But ultimately, finding that Mr. Sturmy was really desirous of being relieved from active duties, the Board was reluctantly compelled to accept his resignation as from the 25th March, 1874. In consideration of his long and faithful services, it was resolved to grant him an Annuity or Retiring Allowance of £106 9s. 2d. for life, in accordance with the 29th Vict., cap. 31. The Clerkship The subject of the vacancy thus occasioned having been referred to a Special Committee, and carefully considered, it was resolved, on the recommendation of such Committee, to divide the duties appertaining to the Clerkship; to advertise for a Clerk; and to appoint as Assistant Clerk and Accountant, Mr. W. H. Atkins, who for many years previously had satisfactorily filled that position under Mr. Sttrmy; and, on the 18th March last, Mr. Henry Simpson, 7 of No. 20, Borough High Street, Solicitor, was duly elected as the Clerk of the Board, both appointments taking effect at Lady-day. A further vacancy in the Staff occurred at the same time by Mr. Bianchi resigning the office of Public Analyst, under the Adulteration Acts, his other duties as the Sanitary Officer of the Board, and numerous professional engagements, preventing him from devoting sufficient time to the work of analyzation; and, as his successor, the Board has appointed Dr. Bernays, Lecturer and Professor of Chemistry at St. Thomas's Hospital, at a salary of One Hundred Guineas per annum. Office of Analyst. On the 14th January last, the Board appointed Mr. Biastchi as Gas Examiner, in accordance with section 27 of the 23rd and 24th Vict., cap. 125, he having offered to undertake the necessary examinations; and a gas-testing chamber has since been fitted up in accordance with the same section. Gas Examined The period for which Mr. Charles Harris had been elected as the representative of this Board at the Metropolitan Board of Works, expiring by effluxion of time on the 10th instant, it was unanimously resolved, at a Special Meeting held on the same day, to re-elect that gentleman for the ensuing period of three years; and a cordial vote of thanks was passed to him for his able and valuable past services as such representative.

Gentlemen, It is my duty and privilege for the eighteenth time to submit for your information the annual statistics bearing upon the health, mortality, and sanitary work in connection with the St. Saviour's Board of Works; and in order to render the facts so revealed more intelligible to those who can only give such Tables the time necessary for a cursory glance, I venture, as I have hitherto done, to summarise their contents. It will be observed that the number of Deaths in the District is in excess of that of the previous year; but although there is an increase, it is not exceptionally large, as the total number registered is below the average of several previous years. The mortality for the whole District for 1873 was 759, but as the number of Births was 1102, an addition of 343 to the population—the mortality must so far be regarded in the light of the almost invariable law of proportion of Deaths to the number of persons living. Of the number of Deaths recorded, 337 were persons under 20 years of age and 31 passed the age of 80. This latter number is augmented by the residence in the Christchurch Workhouse of aged people admitted from two other Districts. The Annual Report of the Registrar-General not having been issued at the date of this Report, I am unable to make any comparison between your District and that of London and its four great Divisions, but my impression from the weekly Records is, that in a sanitary point of view, such a comparison would not be unfavourable to its present condition. Although the Tables exhibit an increase of nine Deaths from Epidemic Diseases, it is a pleasing fact that no case of Death occurred from that terrible scourge, Small-pox. This state of things should be sufficient to encourage those who arc interested in the practice of Vaccination. There is, however, a lingering prejudice against its operation, which can only be overcome by the steady and persistent perseverance of those whose duty it is to enforce the existing laws in reference to this matter, and I am 10 happy to believe that in your District this is the case. You will observe from the Statistical Tables that 104 persons have died from Epidemic Diseases. Of these 2 died from Pyœmia, 4 from Erysipelas, 30 from Measles, 5 from Scarlet Fever, 3 from Diphtheria, 17 from Whooping Cough, 2 from Typhus and Typhoid Fever, 36 from Diarrhoea, 2 from Syphilis, 1 from Dysentery, and 2 from Croup. The increase on the previous year arose principally from Measles, of which there was an increase of 16 against a decrease from Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, and Fever. The Deaths from other causes arc to a great extent attributable to Phthisis and Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. During the time it has been my distinguished honour to hold the position of Medical Officer of Health to this Board, many substantial improvements have been effected, the tendency of which, I have no doubt, has been greatly to promote the sanitary condition of the neighbourhood, and thus justified the expectations of those who framed laws for the purpose, and those who in this District have endeavoured to carry them out. I apprehend there is no tenable reason why Deaths among the population of London should not be reduced to the minimum number which reason and experience teach us to expect. Still, before this be accomplished much has to be done. Both the quality of the water and the method of its supply are far from satisfactory. The unhealthy dwellings of the poor at the present time are exciting very general attention among a class whose position will possibly lead to legislation on the subject. Complaints of the overcrowding in unhealthy dwellings have been reiterated in my Annual Reports, and frequently for years past pointed out by Local Authorities and their Officers; but the subject has hitherto failed to gain that 11 attention which its importance demands. The cure of the evil is undoubtedly a difficult problem, and may possibly be solved without legislative interference; although the Government, under the influence of public opinion, are just at this time endeavouring to remedy the acknowledged evil. I apprehend it is concluded that no class of persons should even helplessly and innocently be left in a position to injure the health of their own families or that of their neighbours by polluting the atmosphere; fresh pure air being as essential as pure water. There can be no doubt that the improved method of water supply in many close and crowded districts is a general boon; but it is to be regretted that so few avail themselves of the advantage the new system offers. Notwithstanding oft-repeated remonstrances from those who arc in the habit of visiting the poor, they in many cases neglect to attend to the necessary duty of cleanliness. This is even the case with those who have been inmates in public institutions where cleanliness is authoritatively insisted upon. It is a fact, that this evil during the past few years has considerably decreased, and with the progress of knowledge and intelligence it will doubtless continue to diminish. Upon the subject of the comparative purity of the water supply in this District, I beg to observe as a result of my own analysis, and that of Professor frankland, that the Companies drawing from the Thames delivered water containing on an average a smaller proportion of solid impurity than in the preceding year. The Southwark and Yauxhall Companies exhibit the greatest improvement. Taking the amount of organic impurity contained in a given volume of the Kent Company's water as unit, the proportional amounts in an equal volume of water supplied by each of the Metropolitan Companies are:— New River 1.4 Southwark 2.8 West Middlesex 3.0 Grand Junction and Lambeth 3.1 Chelsea 3.2 and East London 3.5. The waters were clean and transparent when drawn from the 12 Mains. All the river water had therefore been efficiently filtered. The proportion of organic matter in the Metropolitan waters is more within the control of the Companies than is commonly supposed. Large storage reservoirs enable them to shut out the waters from the rivers when they arc in flood, and carrying down the scourings of ditches and sewers, and the washing of cultivated fields. Storage in reservoirs before filtration effects a large amount of purification by subsidence, which renders the subsequent purification by filtration considerably more perfect. The Companies which possess the greatest storage capacity are the East London, New River, and West Middlesex. The Companies which possess the most perfect filtering apparatus, are the New River, West Middlesex, and Southwark. It is but fair to state that the Southwark and Yauxhall Company have done their best to perfect their filtering apparatus, and rank amongst the best in London. They have also increased the capacity of their subsidence reservoirs. I again take the opportunity of drawing your attention to the right use of disinfectants, more particularly of the disinfection of the sick-chamber and articles contained therein. Dr. Letheby, one of the most able and experienced Medical Officers of Health, advises that all matters discharged from the body should be received in a vessel containing active disinfectants, in the proportion of about half a pint of either a solution of 4 ozs. of Carbolic Acid to a gallon of water, or a solution of 2 lbs. of Sulphate of Iron in a gallon of water; that all articles of clothing should be boiled in water, or plunged into boiling water, before they are taken from the room; and in addition to this, that they should be steeped in a solution of Carbolic Acid of the above-mentioned strength. When the room is vacated, disinfection may be practised with the most perfect success. All the articles contained in such a room should be spread out so us to receive freely Sulphurous Acid fumes which are to be generated therein, and having closed the windows, and stopped up as completely as possible every aperture and outlet, measures should be taken for providing the needful quantity of Sulphurous Acid. One ounce and a half of Sulphur should be used for every 100 cubic feet of space. The Sulphur may be burnt in a 13 shallow pipkin or earthenware saucer, containing some live coals, or a little Bisulphide of Carbon. The pipkin or saucer should be supported upon a pair of tongs laid across a pail of water, so that in case of accident the burning Sulphur may fall into the water and do no injury. After a period of six or eight hours, the room may be opened for ventilation, and the several articles spread out for airing. The floor and other parts of the room should be thoroughly cleansed, and the ceiling lime-washed. Infected clothing and bedding should be subjected to the process of disinfection in the chamber provided by your Board for the purpose in Ewer Street, which may be used by any resident in the District. The passing of the Adulteration of Food Act, with the powers it confers upon the Local Authorities, will no doubt prove an instance of beneficial legislation. The provisions of that Act require considerable modification, and they will doubtless receive in Parliament that attention which their important nature imperatively demands. Meanwhile the various Sanitary Boards arc endeavouring to carry out the Act, and have appointed Analysts and Inspectors for that purpose. The work performed by the Sanitary Inspector will be found in one of the appended Tables. It only remains for me to acknowledge the uniform courtesy and assistance of the Board and its Officers, and to subscribe myself, Your faithful Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 20th May, 1874. 14 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH.—Population at Census, 1871, 14,573.
