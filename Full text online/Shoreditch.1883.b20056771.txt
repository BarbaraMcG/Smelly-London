PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 18th & 19th VIC., CAP.. 120. LONDON: A. T. Roberts, Son & Co., Steam Printing Works, 5, Hackney Road, E. 1884. A REPORT On the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., and of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ending Lady-day, 1884. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Acts." REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1884, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £65,891 13s. 2d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four Quarters was 2s. 4d., being for the Quarter to Midsummer, 7d.; to Michaelmas, 7d.; to Christmas 7d.; and to Lady-day, 7d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s. 6d. The amount of the Guardians' Calls for the year ending Ladyday, 1883, was £54,500; and for the last year, £53,400; and for the Half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1884, is £29,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1884, was nil. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rates will be found in the Balance Sheets, as audited and signed. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the Rates levied for the last year were— s. d. General—in the £ 2 2 Sewers ditto 0 6 2 8 6 The total amount collected on the Vestry Rates for the year was £74,885 16s. 1d., an increase upon the previous year of £5,790 12s. 1d. Of these sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor Rates, large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £53,400 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rates and Metropolitan Asylums Board's charges are paid, there is a sum of £12,242 19s. 11d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £563 12s. 8d. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Sewers Rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated Rate of £13,410 6s. 4d. From the General Rate is paid the School Board Rate of £16,641 7s. 9d., and the Toll Bridges Precept of £1,931 3s. 6d. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, or for the allowance to owners. ASSESSMENT. The valuation of the Parish for Assessment purposes is as follows, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year— List in force- April, 1883. April, 1884. Increase. Gross rental £730,240 £751,295 £21,055 Rateable value 589,764 607,910 18,146 The number of Assessments and the Rateable Value of each Ward, omitting such of the Gas, Water, Railway and other Assessments, as are included in several Wards, are as follows:— Number of Assessments. Rateable Value. Moorfields Ward 2,117 79,319 Church Ward, North 2,215 51,686 Church Ward, South 1,657 54,063 Hoxton Ward 2,717 71,853 Wenlock Ward 1,851 53,305 Whitmore Ward 2,441 53,233 Kingsland Ward 1,791 42,846 Haggerstone, East and West 1,715 32,967 Acton Ward 1,828 40,050 7 The Rateable Value of the Parish is made up as follows:— Railways £59,874 Gas Company 28,344 Water Companies 7,350 Tramway Company 2,500 Regent's Canal Company 738 Board Schools 7,343 Hoxton House Asylum 1,125 Theatres and Taverns attached thereto 2,605 The Town Hall 1,000 Other Assessments of £500 and upwards, including Model Dwellings of that value 24,580 The Workhouse and Infirmary belonging to the Holborn Union in the City Road, is by Local Act rated at £19 only. The Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary is not Assessed. The total of the above is £135,459, which shows that the ordinary Assessments, under £500, amount to £454,305. GROSS AND RATEABLE VALUE. Communications were received from several Vestries and District Boards, suggesting alterations in the Law, and asking for the Vestry's support. Amongst these was a communication from the Vestry of Kensington, suggesting the abolition of the distinction between Gross and Rateable Value. The Vestry, seeing that this is a question affecting not only the Metropolis but the entire Country, and that no serious demand for such an alteration has been made, declined to take any action in the matter. 8 TAMES COMMUNICATIONS. The Metropolitan Board introduced into Parliament a Rill for the construction of a Tunnel between Shadwell and Rotherithe, and Steam Ferries at points lower down the river. Private parties promoted a scheme for the construction of a Duplex Bridge near to the Tower. Several communications were received from the Water-side Local Authorities, some supporting, others opposing the various sohemes, and asking the Vestry's assistance. The Vestry, while fully recognizing the necessity and importance of improved communications between the North and South, east of London Bridge, but having no very direct interest in any of the rival schemes, and seeing that the Waterside Local Authorities were by no means agreed as to the merits of any of them, declined to take any action for or against thorn. None of the schemes were sanctioned by Parliament. SCHOOL BOARD EXPENDITURE. Communications were received from several Vestries and Boards protesting against the increased expenditure, and consequently increased money demands by the London School Board. The amount required from this Parish for the year 1883 was £1(5,641 7s. 9d., and for 1884, £19,525 13s. 2d., being an increase of £2,884 5s. 5d. for the year. The Vestry, it is true, is the moneyraising authority for the School Board, as well as for several other Metropolitan Authorities, but beyond performing this ministerial duty, it has no connection with or control over the School Board. The Members of the School Board are elected directly by the Ratepayers, and the Vestry, considering that the remedy, if any exists, is in the hands of the Ratepayers, declined to interfere with or to express any opinion upon the question. METROPOLITAN WATER SUPPLY. Several attempts have boon made by private Members; in the House of Lords, by Lord Camperdown, and by Mr. Torrens in the House of Commons, to amend the Water Acts, in respect to the Companies powers and charges. None of these proposals made any progress 9 During the year an important Judgment was given in the House of Lords upon a question raised by a Mr. Dobbs as to the meaning of the term "Annual Value." It had always been held by the Companies to mean "Gross Value" or the full rental which an ordinary yearly tenant would pay to the landlord, the latter bearing the expense of repairs, insurances, &c. Mr. Dobbs contended that it was the amount less these expenses, or the same as the Poor Rate would be charged upon. The question had been before four Courts, two deciding one way and two the other; the last, the House of Lords, held in favor of Mr. Dobbs which is of course final. Although "Annual Value" is the lesser value, it does not follow that the Poor Rate value, as stated in the ratebook is conclusive upon the point, as in case of dispute between the consumer and the Company, the Magistrate is to decide. An appeal was made on behalf of Mr. Dobbs and his Committee for aid towards his costs in contesting the above question with the water Companies. The Vestry contributed the sum of fifty pounds. GAS COMPANIES' AMALGAMATION. The Vestry was consulted by the Board of Trade as to its opinion respecting a projected amalgamation between the Gas Light and Coke Company and the South Metropolitan Gas Company. The Vestry, having no direct interest in this question and possessing no sufficient information upon the merits of the subject, offered no opinion. The Amalgamation was not carried out. ELECTRIC LIGHT ORDERS. Following the Electric Light Act of 1882 several notices were given by promoters of Electric Light Companies of intention to apply for Provisional Orders to authorize the supply of Electricity for Lighting and Power to public and private consumers, as stated in the last Annual Report. The only Order proceeded with was that promoted by the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company, which, after some correspondence and a conference with the Board of Trade, was agreed to and passed through Parliament. 10 The Order required that a capital of £15,000 should be appropriated as a separate capital for the purposes of the undertaking, and a deposit of or security for £2,250; and if such deposit was not made within six months the Board of Trade might revoke the Order. The deposit was not made, hut an application was made by the promoters to the Vestry for consent for an extension of time. The Vestry refused for reasons which need not here be stated, and it is anticipated that the promoters will not proceed further with the scheme.* ST. JOHN'S ROAD IMPROVEMENT. This has been completed and the purchase-money paid to the London School Board, towards which the Metropolitan Board will contribute one-half. REGENTS' CANAL RAILWAY. No progress whatever seems to have been made in the direction of the execution of this scheme. It is now certain that the Company must apply to Parliament for an extension of time for completion, or abandon part or the whole of the undertaking. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Vestry has been engaged in four Actions-at-Law during the past year. One in which the Vestry was Plaintiff, to try the right of possession to a piece of land, which being a public nuisance and failing to find an owner who could furnish a satisfactory title, the Vestry enclosed and occupied. In this the Vestry was not successful. In one case an action was brought against the Vestry to recover damages by a person who slipped upon a worn sewer flap ; the case was brought from the Superior to the County Court, and damages were given for £100. In another case a person met with injury while descending some steps from the lown Hall, where he had been to attend a concert. He recovered Since the above was written the Board of Trade have issued notice that the Order will be revoked. The course will thereupon be open for other parties to apply for powers. 11 damages to the amount of £250. In the other case a road was left after repairs (as alleged) in an improper condition, and a horse was damaged. It is possible that the Vestry had a legal defence to this Action, but it being a matter of doubt and not, in a pecuniary sense worth contending, it was settled for £50 damages and costs. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Several prosecutions have been instituted against the keepers of houses kept for immoral purposes. In all cases the really offending parties were fined or imprisoned. Where the fines were paid the Treasury remitted the greater portions of them towards the Vestry's expenses. In several cases the parties, anticipating summary proceedings, decamped. Representations have been made by several parties to the Home Secretary as to the very unsatisfactory condition of the law in relation to this question, and urging that the duty of prosecution should not devolve upon the Parochial Officers (who are not Peace Officers) but upon the Police, and there is reason to believe that the Home Secretary coincides with this View. It would be worthy of consideration whether a united representation to that effect should not be made to the Government by the Local Authorities. PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS. The measures introduced into Parliament during the present Sessions, affecting the Parish of Shoreditch, were few in number, but of some importance. The only Bills of general importance were the London Government Bill of Sir W. Harcourt, and the United Telephone Company's Bill. The former Bill was a measure long promised, and had been dealt with to a certain extent by anticipation. The Vestry in April, 1882, passed a resolution expressing approval of a measure for the reform of the Government of London, which would provide for the 12 administration of purely Local Affairs by Local Councils. When Sir W. Harcourt's Bill was introduced it was found, in the opinion of the Vestry to be antagonistic to the principle above expressed; the Vestry, therefore, petitioned against the Bill. The entire question has been so fully discussed in all its phases as to render it unnecessary to dwell upon it in this Report. It did not pass the second reading through want of time.* The United Telephone Bill was promoted by private parties. Its object was to obtain Parliamentary powers to carry lines across and over streets, as is now practically done, but with doubtful legality. The Vestry with many others opposed the Bill, and the Government having refused to sanction it, it was not proceeded with. Representations have been made to the Government by the Authorities of several Metropolitan Parishes as to the danger to be apprehended from the numerous and ever increasing number of overhead wires, but the reply of the Government was a refusal to interfere until the question of the legal power of the Companies to place the wires over streets, or of the Local Authorities to regulate or remove them had been decided by a Court of Law. The Wandsworth Board of Works brought a test action, which in the first instance went in favour of the Board, but on appeal against it. The Wandsworth Board, it is understood, declines to take the case further—that is, to the House of Lords. It now remains to be seen what steps the Government will take, if any, to place these overhead wires under local control. There is reason to believe that a united effort will be made by the various Local Authorities to urge the Government to fulfil their promise and introduce a Bill for that purpose. Railways, Tramways, &c. Two Bills of a purely local character affecting this Parish in particular were introduced—the London and North Western Railway Bill, and the North Metropolitan Tramways Bill—the former *It is a significant fact relating to the above Bill that, since its introduction in the session to the 30th July, when it was abandoned., the number of petitions presented in its favor were 20, and the total number of signatures 30, so all but one were signed officially (by Chairmen, &c.). Against the Bill the'number of Petitions was '22G, of which 172 were signed officially by the Chairmen and others under seal, and the total number of signatures was 21,556. 13 asked for powers to widen the line running through Shoreditch to the City for a short distance, viz. Plough Yard to Hearn Street. Plough Yard was to be diverted. The Bridges over Skinner Street and Primrose Street were to be widened. The Vestry asked that Plough Yard should be widened, paved and sewered, at the Company's expense, and failing to obtain this by negotiation, opposed the Bill in Parliament. The Vestry in conjunction with the Metropolitan Board obtained a widening of the street to be substituted from a proposed width of about 18 to about 25 feet, and by its own opposition secured an obligation on part of the Company to pave and sewer Plough Yard to the Vestry's satisfaction, and also for the improved lighting of Skinner Street and Primrose Street. Tramways. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company introduced a Bill to authorize the extension of the system through Great Eastern Street, Commercial Street, and Bethnal Green Road. The Vestry of Shoreditch offered no opposition, but the Local Authorities of the other parishes, with the inhabitants, offered some opposition to the Commercial Street and Betbnal Green Road extensions, and in the end only the Great Eastern Street extension— Old Street to Shoreditch—was sanctioned. This paragraph alludes only to that part of the Tramways Company's scheme as it would have affected this Parish. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 126 times; the Council Chamber 5 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charges. The receipts for letting Hall, Council Chamber, and Committee Rooms were £397 17s. Od. YESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Vestry and Committee Meetings held during the year ended April 20th, 1884, is as follows— Number of Vestry Meetings 32 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 34 14 Sewers, &c., Committee 27 General Purposes Committee 28 Valuation Committee, including Sub-Committee 5 Town Hall Committee do. 24 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee 6 Total 156 Appended are various Tables showing Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities, Loans Outstanding, Analyst's Reports, List of Contracts, &c., &c.

To the Vestry of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch. Gentlemen, 5,039 births—2,540 males and 2,499 females—and 2,972 deaths were registered in the twelve months ending 25th March, 1884. Deducting the deaths (267) which occurred in Holborn Infirmary, the mortality was 21.3 per 1,000 living, being slightly below the average of the last five years, which was 21.65 per 1,000. The largest number of deaths was registered in Haggerstone District, in which is situate Shoreditch Infirmary. The following statistics show the rate of mortality in the different Registration Districts throughout the Parish:— Population Deaths. Average per 1,000 living. Holywell 7,376 134 18.1 Saint Leonard 14,967 310 21.3 Hoxton New Town 29,937 501 16.7 Haggerstone 46,275 1,224 26.0 74 600 deaths occurred in public institutions in the Parish, viz.:— 249 in Shoreditch Infirmary, 267 in Holborn Infirmary (situate in Hoxton New Town), 64 in the North Eastern Hospital, and 20 in Hoxton House. Diseases acknowledged to be induced by cold and damp were very destructive. There were 395 deaths from bronchitis, 290 from phthisis, and 187 from pneumonia, making a total of 872 deaths. During the previous year there were a total of 840 deaths registered under the above headings. 1,413 deaths occurred under one year of age—against 922 in the previous year. The deaths under five years of age havo decreased—being 2,399 against 2,582 in the previous year. 830 deaths occurred of persons 65 years of age and upwards, viz.:— 537 from 65 to 75; 249 from 75 to 85; 42 from 85 to 95; and 2 deaths were registered at 99 and at 100 years. In the previous year 436 persons died between 65 and 75 years of age; 180 from 75 to 85; 37 from 85 to 95; and 6 over 95 years of ago. In infancy (from 1 to 5 years of age) the largest number of deaths were caused by lung disease (254), comprising 149 from bronchitis and 105 from pneumonia. The disease which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility, 141 deaths; convulsions, 108; whooping cough, 56; premature birth, 141; and diarrhoea, 104. From the age of 55 and upwards 250 deaths were caused by bronchitis; 79 by heart disease; and 85 by paralysis; 236 were registered under the term of "old age." ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 370 deaths, viz.:—57 by whooping cough; 120 by diarrhœa; 104 by scarlet fever; 60 by measles; 15 by diptheria; and 14 by other zymotic diseases. 13 of the 57 deaths from whooping cough occurred in infants under one year of age. The influence of age is manifest,—40 of the 57 deaths from whooping cough were in infants under two years of age, and 101 of the 120 deaths from diarrhoea occurred in infants under two years of age. There were only three deaths from small-pox. 75 DWELLINGS.—A great deal of work has been done in the past year to improve the dwellings, and the work has been well done. Walls and ceilings cleansed and repaired, floors, stairs, roofs, &c., repaired to make them safe and serviceable. Water closets in 736 premises have been cleansed and repaired, and to promote cleanliness and prevent dangerous accumulations 916 closets have been provided with water supply. To secure more dryness in the surface ground, and to allow of more ventilation in the basements of 663 dwellings, their yards have been paved with stone or cement concrete. Much care has been taken to prevent the atmosphere being polluted by dust accumulations. 578 new dust bins have been provided—and from 114 small confined premises the dust bins have been removed, and improved public dust bins erected, in open spaces. Many of the dwellings improved are small old cottages, which had become unfit for human beings to live in. But in them much of the surface decay has been removed and the houses made drier, and the sanitary appliances more suitable, so that the dwellings are now habitable. 22 premises have been closed, as they were unfit for human habitation. ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS IMPROVEMENT ACTS.— There are places in the Parish where the dwellings are so crowded together, and so closed in, that proper ventilation is impossible; and the structures are so much decayed, and so damp, that they are dangerous to health. It is exceedingly difficult, or impossible, to keep the walls, &c., of such houses free from poisonous accumulations. There are other dwellings, like Watson's Place, Ware Street, Louisa Street and Nancy Street, which have been constructed of such defective materials that the owners cannot prevent the dwellings becoming unfit for human habitation. I have witnessed the earnest efforts of many Leaseholders, and a large expenditure of money and labor to effect improvements in these dwellings ; for a short time they have been much improved and made habitable, 76 but a year or so of occupation has manifested that the labor and the capital were wasted. These premises are notorious to your Vestry; their defects have been so often reported to the Sanitary Authority; and when contagious diseases prevailed in the Parish it occurred in these dwellings in an exceptional degree owing to the injurious condition of the premises, and to the destitution and uncleanliness of the occupants. These facts and experiences have compelled your Medical Officer to report these houses, together with a number of other dwellings named in the Inspector's Report, to the Metropolitan Board of Works, as unfit for human habitation; under the "Artizans' Dwellings Improvement ('Cross') Acts." But the Metropolitan Board of Works has declined to bring the houses under the operation of the Act. DRAINS.—A large proportion of the Inspector's time has been occupied in securing better drains for dwellings. In many premises these are astoundingly defective, and it is beyond question that the water carriage of the sewage, as at present in use in many premises is a failure; where drainage is most needed, (that is to remove sewage from the dwellings), it fails to prevent accumulations of sewer gas and soil deposits; and the careless manner in which the drains have in many instances been constructed, renders them dangerous. These drains not only fail to carry off the sewage adequately, but they saturate the ground around the dwellings with increasing accumulation of sewage. THE CONSTANT WATER SUPPLY.—Has been in operation throughout the Parish several years, and shews its advantage over the intermittent supply, the inhabitants obtain fresher and cleaner water. Wherever water butts are found they are ordered to be removed; only 12 have been met with this year. In 548 dwellings during the past year, alterations have been made to enable the inhabitants to obtain their supply of water direct from the main, instead of drawing from cisterns. The inhabitants have occasionally complained that they have not a constant service of water, but the interruptions were only for 77 a short time, and when the attention of the New River Company was directed to the complaints, the inconvenience was lessened or was removed. DISINFECTION.—To arrest the spread of contagious diseases 318 infected houses were disinfected, the infected rooms fumigated by sulphur, and subsequently the windows kept open to expose the room freely to the oxydising destroying influences of the open air. The walls of the rooms, where necessary, were stripped and cleaned. 1,284 infected articles were disinfected by heated air at the Disinfecting Oven. 354 cases of contagious disease were reported to the Sanitary Department. 31 were cases of Small Pox, and 28 of these were removed to Hospital. Means for isolating the infected persons have been at all times available in the Hospitals of the Asylums Board. DUSTING AND SCAVENGING.-The inadequate removal of refuse must of necessity become an increasing evil, as people become more and more crowded together. The common infection from decomposing agents that precedes the specific infection of "disease" evidently should be more and more guarded against. It would be more saving from a health point of view, thereby promoting industry, to obtain more suitable arrangements for the removal of the dust and other refuse, and for the cleansing and watering of the streets, to keep the atmosphere of streets and dwellings free from the injurious matters that collect on the roadway and elsewhere. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 79 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH, Sanitary Department, To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendance during the year ending 25th March, 1884, shewing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notioe, and the orders made for their abatement.

MISCELLANEOUS. Over-crowding abated in 1 premises. Water restored in 175 „ Urinals attached to public houses, re-constructed in 9 „ Urinals on private premises trapped and purified in 4 „ Animals, kept so as to be a nuisance, removed from 15 Accumulation of dung and rubbish removed from 19 „ Making a total of 7,892 separate nuisances, dangerous to health, abated in 1,561 dwellings, 82 In addition to the ordinary notioos served for the abatement of nuisances 523 letters have been written. To show the charaoter of the work done, a few cases are given in detail as follows:— 1 to 16, BANKSTOCK BUILDINGS, WHITMORE ROAD.— Are two roomed houses, each house has a small yard, scullery, and water closet attachod. Tho sculleries were paved with soft bricks imbeded in wot filth—tho common house sink in each scullery was an untrapped five hole stone. The water closets were filthy in tho extreme—without water supply and standing over disused cesspools. The yards wero not paved—and the pipe drains which had been laid within a few years—were laid in a very irregular manner that permitted sewage to escape and sodden the ground. Notioes wore served on the owner in compliance with whioh, the cesspools wore emptied, and filled up with lime rubbish—the closets re-constructed with concrete floors, and water laid on. The drains re-laid throughout, the yards and sculleries paved with cement concrete—and one publio dust bin of improved construction built in the court, which relieves all the houses from accumulations of refuse in the small back yards. 1 to 6, NORFOLK GARDENS, CURTAIN ROAD.—Are four roomed houses—the yards wero badly paved, water closets foul and no water laid on. Water stored in oisterns situate in foul yards. The forecourts, were unpaved and undrained and consequently foul. Notices were served on the owner in compliance with which the water closets have been re-constructed, with concrete floors, and water laid on. The yards paved with cement concrete and water given direct from the main in lieu of cisternage, and a public dust bin of the improved order built. In addition to these improvements, on my recommendation, tho owner has removed the whole of the wood fencing that 83 surrounded the forecourts—and paved the entire space with cement concrete, and thrown it open to the public—it now forms, with the well paved footway of Norfolk Gardens, an excellent playground for the little children of this crowded place. 1 to 6, NELSON'S PLACE, MOYE STREET, HAGGERSTONE.— Are two roomed houses, they were extremely damp, dilapidated, and foul. Under notices served, the yards and water closets have been paved and re-constructed in a superior manner—water laid on to the closets, and water given direct from the main. New floors and hearths laid and an improved public dust bin built. In addition to these improvements, acting on my recommendation, the owner has removed the whole of the dilapidated wood fencing that surrounded the dirty unpaved and undrained forecourts, and paved the whole area of the court, with cement concrete. This is a great boon to the poor people living there, not merely as preventing the walls of their houses standing in a swamp, as formerly—but in promoting a measure of cleanliness in their houses, that was previously impossible, when every footstep left traces of the miry ground of the yards and forecourts. Not only is cause of damp removed by the paving referred to, and cleanly habits engendered, but (as in Norfolk Gardens) an excellent playground is provided for children. GRANVILLE BUILDINGS, 106, Suites of Apartments—These Model Dwellings were reported in the Annual Report of 1877, as having been in a very injurious condition, water for drinking purposes being stored in cisterns placed immediately over the water closets of apartments to which they belonged, and immediately under the water closets of the apartment above, with no effectual cover to prevent water or excreta which might overflow the closet pan above, from polluting the drinking water below—and there was evidence that such pollution had taken place largely. 84 Much work was done at that time to improve the condition of the dwellings generally. The cisterns referred to were removed—and water supplied from large cisterns placed on the roofs. On re-visiting the premises, it was found the cisterns placed on the roofs were much neglected and very dirty. Notices were therefore served requiring, amongst other things, that the tenants should have the advantages of a constant supply of water direct from the main without storage in cisterns. This has been done—and it should be stated as illustrating the dangers inseparable from cisternage, that in the course of the works, the workmen found in one cistern the body of a cat in a very advanced state of decomposition. The yards were originally paved very badly with tar paving which in the course of years had become quite unfit for any useful purpose. On my recommendation the owners have relevelled the whole of the yards, and paved them in a superior manner with asphalte. These again form excellent playgrounds for a large number of children. HOUSES UNFIT FOR HABITATION.—Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5, Jane Shore Court—South Side—Shoreditch. These houses have frequently been brought under the notice of the Sanitary Committee, and much money, and effort expended by the owner to keep them fit for habitation, but their defective construction and the evil reputation of the place have effectually shut out a careful class of tenants; thus about three years ago after having been closed for six months, during which time they were cleansed and repaired, it was found they could only be let to a class of persons who destroyed and abused what was intended for their advantage. The Metropolitan Board of Works having refused to deal with this court under the Artizan's Dwelling Improvement Acts. Notice was served on the owner to close the houses, they being in a state unfit for habitation. This was done, and the premises continue closed. 85 1 to 17, WATSON'S PLACE.— It was stated in the annual report of 1882, that in consequence of the owner's neglect it had been necessary to enter these premises under the powers of the "Metropolis Local Management Acts" and re-construct the drains, re-build the water closets, build dust bins, and pave the yards and areas, (these works were executed by the Vestry's contractor under my direction in a substantial manner.) Summonses were taken out at that time against the owner, and a Magistrate's order obtained under which the interior of the houses were cleansed and repaired, but not substantially— subsequently most of the houses were let in tenements, many of them to separate tenants for each room, none of whom could be held responsible for general conditions. It was no particular person's business to clean the passages, stairs, yards, or water closets, therefore they were not cleaned. It was no one's special obligation to require the dust to be removed, it was therefore permitted to accumulate until official inspection secured its removal—and it was no one's special duty or interest to prevent destruction—therefore water taps were broken off—doors of dust bins wrenched off—rain pipes torn down—roofs of back additions destroyed—the internal fittings, doors, sashes, stairs, &c., were also being destroyed, when it became necessary to serve notices requiring the houses to be closed as unfit for habitation. This was done. The property has since passed into other hands and is now being repaired, but the entire fabric of the houses—built of the worst materials and in the worst style of workmanship precludes the hope of any permanent improvement being effected. No Police Court Summonses have been taken out during the past year.
