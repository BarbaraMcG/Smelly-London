This Report is compiled in accordance with the Public Health Regulations 1959 and Ministry of Health Circular 1/69. Health Education was continued as opportunities arose. Films and discussions were arranged in schools on the hazards of cigarette smoking and other subjects. Elderly citizens were advised on the importance of regular checks on their eyesight, hearing, feet and on the lighting, floor-coverings and other amenities of their homes, with a view to reducing the risk of accidents and increased dependence on others with advancing age. I am convinced that retired people have an important and useful part to play in helping each other, and in the training of their grandchildren in good habits of personal hygiene, feeding and behaviour while "baby-sitting". All too often, these useful opportunities are wasted in front of the television set watching advertisements for sugary and starchy foods, and eating too many sweets at the same time, VITAL STATISTICS The health of the population continues to be satisfactory. There was a further small fall in the birth-rate, but there were more deaths than in the previous year, mainly due to coronary disease and pneumonia. CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Under new Regulations, infective jaundice (hepatitis) has become notifiable, mainly for the purpose of knowing to what extent, if any, this condition is being spread by the use of hypodermic syringes by drug addicts or others. None of the 5 cases notified were attributable to this cause. Immunisation against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, poliomyelitis, smallpox and tuberculosis have all shown increases over the previous year, and the only notifications among these diseases were 22 of whooping cough and 6 of measles. The new measles vaccine was given to 659 children in the District without ill-effect, but the scheme has had a setback, owing to doubts concerning the safety of a small number of batches of the vaccine issued. The number of measles cases was certainly less than anticipated, and it is therefore hoped that the present setback will be temporary. /The 3 The epidemic of influenza which was forecast and against which extensive precautions had been proposed, fortunately showed no signs of materialising. Vaccination of the general public was not recommended or considered necessary. RE-HOUSING PRIORITY CSV MEDICAL GROUNDS 105 requests for priority for re-housing on medical grounds were referred to me for assessment, usually supported by a doctor's written certificate. Each case was fully investigated and my recommendations were as follows:- Diseases or Conditions Total Applicants Priority Recommended Priority Not recommended Asthma, bronchitis, catarrhal diseases etc, 28 13 15 Blood pressure 4 4 0 Heart disease 6 5 1 Nervous disease (Anxiety states, neurasthenia, neurosis etc.) 32 18 14 Rheumatism 12 10 2 Tuberculosis 2 2 0 Other diseases 5 5 0 Other conditions 16 8 8 105 65 40 Figures for 1964 were 113 49 64 " " 1965 " 89 46 43 " " 1966 " 90 46 44 " " 1967 " 111 61 50 The 40 applicants not recommended for medical priority include (1) Illness not aggravated by housing conditions; (2) Temporary indispositions; (3) Those pleading the discomforts of overcrowding and structural defects (i.e. grounds other than medical); (4) Repeated requests already assessed. 4 /SECTION SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 AND 1962 During the year, 11 cases in possible need of care and attention were investigated and kept under observation with the services of the district nurse, health visitor, home help, meals-on-wheels, as necessary. Subsequently, 2 of these cases were voluntarily removed to hospital. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF STAFF I examined 53 officers and staff of the Chigwell Urban District Council and 9 officers and staff of the Essex County Council on appointment for duties in the District; also 10 Chigwell Urban District Council staff and 6 Essex County Council staff were assessed and reported on for sick-pay and superannuation purposes, following prolonged periods of sick-leave or retirement. Finally, I would again like to express ray thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. To all who have provided me with statistical and other information for inclusion in this report, my grateful acknowledgements are also made. H. FRANKS,M.B.,B.S., B.Hy., D.P.H.

LOUGHTON: Roding Road Church Hall. /SCHOOL 12 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE: The following extracts from the Annual Report of the Divisional School Medical Officer for the West Essex Division are of interest:- "During 1968 detailed preparations were made for the beginning of a new system of selective school medical examinations. Among the changes to be made were the institution of an annual vision test for children aged 7 and over and an audiometry examination for every school entrant. There would be greater reliance on questionnaires for older children in place of the routine examinations which have formed the corner stone of school medical work for so many years. It seemed likely that the school doctors' time could be used to better advantage in such a scheme but that there would be little alteration in the total time required to do what was needed. Special Schools: It has long been recognised that a day special school for educationally sub-normal children was needed in the Chigwell area. During 1968 arrangements were made to open a day school in premises used as an ordinary junior school. The new school was to be named St. Luke's and it was to be opened in January 1969 with between 30 and 40 pupils. At the time of writing the number of pupils has increased to 47 whose ages range from 7 to 13. Most of the pupils are 9 or 10 years of age. The large number of children who need special educational treatment solely because they are slow learners is a serious problem in this Division and it is hoped that St. Luke's will help solve many of the difficulties which have existed in the past. School Dental Service: In previous Annual Reports mention has been made of the regular inspection and treatment which has been given to the residential special schools each year. It is now pleasing to be able to report a very positive improvement in the dental health of the children at these schools as evidenced by figures which are available for pupils at High View Residential School. In 1965 at the school dental inspection at this school, 72% of the pupils needed treatment. This high figure dropped in the 2 succeeding years, and at the latest inspection in December 1968 only 43% of the pupils needed treatment. Because of the resignation of the dental health teacher there has been very little progress with the dental health education programme in the Chigwell Urban District. However, a further dental health teacher was appointed at the end of the year to take /up 13 "up her duties at the beginning of 1969, and it is hoped that future reports will be able to announce the continuation and extension of the programme. Tuberculosis Case Finding: The unknown positive reactors were referred to the Chest Physicians who arranged any other investigations considered necessary. It is more than 6 years since a case of tuberculosis has been discovered by this means and it is possible that having regard to the low incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis amongst the indigenous population the time spent on carrying out these tests is not justified by the results obtained. Infectious Diseases: There were no serious outbreaks of infectious disease in schools. Child Guidance Service: The Loughton branch, now having a psychiatric social worker, psychotherapist and psychologist directly attached is able to able to function as an independent unit under its medical director, Dr. J, Waldman, and provides the full range of diagnostic, consultative and therapeutic facilities for its community area. School Psychological Service: Special Schools - Woodcroft continues to be used for placement of children in cases approved by the Department of Education and Science. Regular visits are made to Woodcroft and weekly visits to High View School, for purposes of assessment and educational advice. A similar contact is planned with St. Lukes, as from January 1969. Physical Education: It is disturbing to find that, in spite of precautions, the number of pupils suffering from plantar warts tends to increase. Schools in the Loughton area were affected at the beginning of the Autumn Term 1968. One school with a high proportion of cases withdrew from swimming at the public bath for the second half of the term. Although school children are only a section of the population using public baths, strict instructions have been issued to schools in an attempt to ensure that children attending during school hours are not spreading the infection. We are grateful for the support and co-operation of the School Medical Officer in. difficult cases " /HOME 14 HOME NURSES: BUCKHURST HILL 5 Mrs, J. Turner, 55 Walnut Way (01-504-7689) Mr. H.

Dr. Windle Taylor, the Director of the Water Examination Department of the Metropolitan Water Board, has kindly supplied the following information regarding the water supply for the district:- "1. (a) The supply was satisfactory both as to (i) quality, and (i.ii) quantity throughout 1968. (b) All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine; after a predetermined period of contact the pipes are flushed out and refilled; samples of water are then collected from these treated mains; and the mains are returned to service only after results are found to be satisfactory. The quality control from these laboratories is carried out by means of daily sampling from sources of supply, from the treatment works or well stations, from the distribution system, and through to the consumer. Any sign of contamination or any other abnormality is immediately investigated. (c) (i) The Board has no record of the number of structurally separate dwellings supplied in your area, but the population supplied direct according to the Registrar General's estimates at 30th June, 1968, was 56,350. (ii) No houses were permanently supplied by standpipe. (d) No artificial fluoride was added, and where the fluoride content is indicated in the analyses it represents the naturally occurring fluoride in the water. 2. (a) The supply was derived from the following works and pumping stations:- Lee Bridge works with some well water from time to time from Chingford Mill and a little from Ferry Lane works and Waltham Abbey well. Between May and September some water was derived from the interim supply from Coppermills Works. No new sources of supply were instituted and there were no changes to the general scheme of supply in your area. The number of samples collected and the bacteriological and chemical analyses of the supply from the above sources after treatment are shown on the attached sheets. 18 (b) (b) On account of their hardness content and alkaline reaction the Board's river and well water supplies are not considered to be plumbo-solvent. It should, however, be appreciated that all types of water pick up varying amounts of metal from the material of water piping particularly when it is newly installed; this applies to copper. zinc, iron and also to lead. Special tests for lead have been carried out during 1968 on 100 premises where a lead supply pipe is installed. The premises were chosen to give an even distribution of samples throughout the whole of the Board's area. Two samples were collected from each premises; one was the first running of water standing in the lead pipe overnight and the other was a sample of water after running the tap for a few minutes. The results are set out in the accompanying table:- Lead content of water from main taps in consumers' premises Lead content (mg/l Pb) Samples of water standing in lead pipe overnight Samples of water after running the tap Less than 0.01 10 37 0.01 31 57 0.02 21 4 0.03 8 1 0.04 9 0 0.05 5 0 0.06 5 0 0.07 4 1 0.08 1 0 0.09 3 0 0.10 1 0 0.12 1 0 0.16 1 0 100 premises 100 premises The above results are very satisfactory and the figures are within the limits of the World Health Organisation European Standards for Drinking Water Quality. This states that the upper limit for lead in running water in the supply should not be more than 0.1 mg/l (Pb); but where water undertakings continue to use lead piping the concentration of lead (as Pb) should not exceed 0.3 mg/l after 16 hours contact with the pipes. /Water -19- "Water Samples: (a) Average results of Chemical Examination.

Edwards, C.Eng.M.I.C.E.,M.I.Mun.E.,A.M.B.I.M., Engineer and Surveyor, has kindly supplied the following information - (a) Drainage and Sewerage: The soil drainage from the greater part of the District gravitates to the main disposal works at Luxborough which was improved in 1938, was extended after the war and recently has been further improved with the addition of final effluent and storm water treatment lagoons. A scheme for a further extension has now been submitted to the Ministry consisting of more filters and humus tanks. -21- A smaller part of the District drains to the Millers Lane Sewage Disposal Works from whence the Council has now decided to lay a trunk sewer to take the flow to the Luxborough Lane Works, thereby eliminating the need for a second Disposal Works at Millers Lane. The completion of these improvements is expected to result in a continued high standard of purity in the effluent to be discharged to the River Rodmg. As regards sewerage, the Council is faced not only with the increasing foul flows from the new development, but also with some ageing and unsatisfactory sewers which contribute to the flooding difficulties referred to below. Generally, there is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist. These combined sewers have caused flooding at various points in the District and work has started on the laying of new surface water sewers to remove part of the flow from the combined sewers in South Loughton and Buckhurst Hill and thus from the Sewage Treatment Works, Schemes costing a total of £250,000 have been completed, but there is still more work to be done. A small area of Buckhurst Hill drains into the sewers of the London Borough of Redbridge at Woodford, thence via Chingford and to the East Middlesex Scheme. Part of Chigwell Row drains to the London Boroughs of Redbridge and Barking. There are 5 outlying pumping stations lifting the flow from low lying areas up to the main gravity sewers. (b) Public Cleansing: Domestic refuse is being collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and labour. A fleet of 7 compressing type refuse collection vehicles is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a FREE service for removing bulky domestic articles (e.gr mattresses, bedsteads etc) on request from householders, THIS FREE SERVICE CANNOT BE PUBLICISED TOO MUCH as it is provided to combat the other alternative of tipping old mattresses, etc., into ditches or onto forest land or roadside verges. The new Civic Amenities Act will also be of help in combatting this problem. Trade refuse also is collected, a charge related to actual cost being made only for refuse, the character of which is clearly not domestic. /Until -22- Until now, refuse has been disposed of by controlled tipping in Chigweil at a site leased to the Council,, The refuse was covered with spoil, hardcore or other innocuous filling, and during tipping, only a very small surface of refuse remained uncovered. Measures were taken against flies, etc., as necessary from time to time, but this rarely happened. As this tip is now full, further and more long term arrangements for refuse disposal have been made at great cost to the ratepayers because other possible controlled tip sites are not available within the District. Transportation of refuse in bulk to tips in outer Essex starts in April, 1969 using 3 new and large bulk transporter vehicles from the new Transfer Depot in Luxborough Lane. Salvage of paper continued to produce sales during the year. Trailers have been purchased for attachment to the refuse vehicles so that salvage can be better pre-separated before tipping. Nearly 5,000 road gullies in County and District roads are emptied (and re-sealed with clean water) by machine regularly during the year by contract. (c) Swimming Pool: The Council's new covered swimming pool was finished in the summer of 1967, and has had a very successful year. It is a real asset to the District, particularly for children and clubs, and the total number of users was 328,000 for the first year's operation. 3. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1964.
