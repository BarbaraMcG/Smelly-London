BOROUGH OF WEMBLEY ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the Year 1954 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1954. This Report has been compiled in the following five chapters, four with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services.

VITAL STATISTICS. 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1954 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 129,500 and whilst this is considerably below 131,384 the census figure for 1951 it probably represents the most accurate figure attainable. It is an interesting observation that the population of Wembley and Kingsbury recorded in the census of 1931 was some 65,799, an inter-census increase of 99.7%. Wembley remains the fifth largest County District in Middlesex, those greater, according to population, being Harrow, Ealing, Willesden and Hendon. 2. In 1954 there were recorded 1,481 live births, giving a birth rate of 11.44 per thousand of the estimated population. The number of deaths was 1,118 giving a crude death rate of 8.63 per thousand. When the comparability factor (1.10) is applied the standardised death rate becomes 9.49, a decrease on last year's figure and below the national rate of 11.3 per thousand of the population. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 18.23 showed a slight drop compared with the figure of 1953 and is below the national rate for England and Wales yet it demands some attention. Prematurity of birth and congenital malformation are the main causes of death in very young infants and an emergency unit is maintained at the Edgware General Hospital which can be called to the house when a premature birth occurs to give immediate and skilled attention prior to removal if necessary to hospital. 4. During the year there was one death from maternal causes. 4 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A. CERTAIN VITAL STATISTICS, 1954 from figures supplied by Registrar-General.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital are situated in the Borough and these hospitals are under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross Hospital. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the Hendon Isolation Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included:— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 8181.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex. (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.)

Edgware Chest Clinic, Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 4467/8.) 12 2. AMBULANCE SERVICE. A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Local Health Authority at:— No. 4 Depot. (ELGar 5506.) The accident service is obtained by dialling 999. The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3. HEALTH SERVICES. Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, are provided by the County Council and relevant details in so far as they apply to the borough are included below:— County Medical Officer : A.

Only 2 cases, both adults, were referred to Kensington Medicinal Baths for treatment more intensive than could be given at the Clinics or in the homes. The generalisation remains true that infestation is scarcely a Public Health problem in Wembley. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 5. MORTUARY. The public mortuary which was built a good many years ago at a time when the population was under 20,000, has continued to meet the needs of the district. That this has been possible is partly due to the provision in recent years of a refrigerated chamber which has proved of inestimable benefit. Neverthless, the time cannot be too far off when a new mortuary planned on presentday standards of lay-out and equipment will be a necessity. 162 bodies were deposited in the mortuary during the year, the majority of which were on orders from the Coroner so that postmortem examinations could be made. 15 STATISTICAL APPENDIX B.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 1. SERVICES PROVIDED, Notification, investigation, pamphlets issued on the various infectious diseases, exclusion from school of patients and contacts, advice re milk handlers—Disinfection —Hospitalisation generally at Hendon Isolation Hospital or Neasden Hospital, re puerperal pyrexia and ophthalmia neonatorum, Emergency Bed Service, re poliomyelitis at Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, re smallpox as arranged by the Regional Hospital Board— Notification of tuberculosis—Weekly and quarterly returns to the Registrar-General and County Medical Officer—Authentication of travellers' inoculation state—Food poisoning notification and investigation—Scabies, arrangements with Royal Borough of Kensington— Complete bacteriological service available at Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, outfits distributed from Public Health Department. 2. There is little to note in this Section for the year, as the absence of any unusual infectious disease and the lack of any major outbreak of notifiable disease have not occasioned serious concern during the year. The incidence of common infections of infancy varies slightly from time to time and the figures in the statistical appendix indicate that the experience in 1954 was not unusual or in any way adverse. It will be seen from figures later in the chapter that there were two outbreaks of food poisoning of which the Department was aware, involving 48 cases, although all of these were mild and transient. There is no doubt that a number of mild cases and of mild food poisoning outbreaks occur where the symptoms are so transient that medical attention is not called and the cases, therefore, are not notified. It would be a help in tracing the source of contamination if such cases could be brought to the notice of the Department at a very early stage when remains of the food eaten may well be available for bacteriological investigation. The result of these investigations would enable advice to be given to the kitchen staff where the outbreak had originated and would enlarge our knowlege of sources of infection and enable us to give more detailed advice to the community generally. 3. The supervision of contacts landing from ship or aeroplane called for routine surveillance of 4 persons regarding smallpox but no persons regarding typhoid fever. Constant vigilance must be exercised on persons arriving from infected foreign areas and this supervision must be given with discretion and understanding. International Certificates of vaccination and immunisation were authenticated in respect of 635 residents intending to proceed overseas. 17 18 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

HOUSING. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. This Act came into force on the 30th August of this year. A circular accompanying the Act states that the new Act provides the statutory powers for widening the scope of housing policy and necessary to implement the proposals made in the Government's White Paper, "Houses—The Next Step." Since the War, policy has been concerned mainly with the erection of new houses and flats for families lacking these, but Parliament has now decided the time has come to give more attention to the nation's stock of existing houses. In 25 particular, the Act facilitates the exercise of the Council's statutory responsibilities for the clearance and replacement of slum houses, the enforcement of essential repairs and the encouragement of improvements and conversions. The Council is required within twelve months to submit for the Minister's approval proposals for dealing with houses in the area which appear to be unfit for human habitation and suitable for demolition. A general survey of the older properties in the Borough is being made and will be reported to the Council in due course. Another part of the Act deals with the increase of rents of houses, which are claimed by the landlord to be in good condition. Where an application for rent increase has been made and the property is held by the tenant not to be in good repair, then upon an application from the tenant for a Certificate of Disrepair, the premises are inspected by the Sanitary Inspectors and the details of the defects are reported to the Health Committee who decide whether or not the defects warrant the issue of a Certificate of Disrepair. The number of Certificates granted was 22 and the number of applications refused was 2. 3. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough, which is provided by the Colne Valley Water Co., except for a small area in the southern end of the district supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Co., remained satisfactory in quality and quantity. The supply is pumped from deep wells in the chalk outside the Borough boundaries. All of the samples taken from piped supplies were reported as satisfactory. No tendency to plumbo solvent action has been detected. All dwelling houses in the Borough are provided with a mains water supply. There is a number of private wells in the Borough all in connection with industrial undertakings, but in no instance is the water from these sources used for drinking. The Council have continued to express their concern at the hardness of the public water supplies which expressed a total hardness range from 234—264 parts per million. Whilst there would not appear to be evidence of prejudicial effects to health from such hard water its detrimental effects on boilers and hot water systems are well-known. 26 4. SWIMMING POOLS. The two outdoor Swimming Pools have continued to be a source of enjoyment and healthy recreation. "Breakpoint" chlorination or superchlorination which was installed just prior to the 1951 season has made it possible to maintain a sparkling clear water, together with a minimum risk of infection. Attendances at the Pools during the year were:— Kingsbury 65,589 Vale Farm, Wembley 71,976 5. FOOD HYGIENE. The Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1954, is not yet operative but under Section 6 the Ministers at some future date may make such regulations as appear to them to be expedient for securing the observance of sanitary and cleanly conditions and practices in connection with the sale of food for human consumption; its importation, preparation, transport, storage, packaging, wrapping, exposure for sale, or otherwise for the protection of the public health. It is hoped that when this Act commences there will be issued a series of bold and precise regulations which will replace the inadequacies of the existing law. So far as this Borough is concerned the food premises generally are kept in a reasonably good and hygienic condition and the managements are mostly co-operative in their endeavours to observe the Council's "Clean Food" Byelaws. Various methods are adopted for "protecting" food from contamination by dust, dirt and flies, etc., particularly cooked meats, cheese, pies and cream products, which are eaten without further cooking. In some cases the food is covered by sheets of cellophane or muslin and in other cases glass or perspex covers are provided. It is still, even with these precautions, difficult to prevent the occasional fly getting into contact with the food and until all food premises have refrigerated display counters vigilance must continue. Until all employees are conscious of their obligations, and practice in their daily routine a severe and hygienic code, instruction, education and publicity must be our unrelenting task. The Wembley Clean Food Association do much to augment the activities of the Council's officers in this sphere. The high standard of the code of practice which all members observe and which gives a higher standard than is at present enforceable by law is deeply 27 appreciated by the inspectorate. At the end of the year 125 traders were members of this Association. 6. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. The Committee on Air Pollution under the Chairmanship of Sir Hugh Beaver reported in November of this year. It was appointed to examine the nature, causes and effects of air pollution and the efficacy of present preventive measures; to consider what further preventive measures are practicable; and to make recommendations. In the introduction to this Report the Committee state their emphatic belief that air pollution on the scale with which we are familiar in this country to-day is a social and economic evil which should no longer be tolerated, and that it needs to be combated with the same conviction and energy as were applied one hundred years ago in securing pure water. They are convinced that pollution on the scale we know can be prevented. To do this will require a national effort and will entail costs and sacrifices; the recommendations made will involve expenditure by the Government, local authorities, industry and householders alike. They express confidence that their proposals, if carried out, will secure happier and more healthy living conditions for millions of people, and on all counts the cost of the cure will be far less than the national loss in allowing the evil to continue. The most serious immediate problem to be tackled is visible pollution by smoke, grit and dust, and definite recommendations are made in regard to these, although it is emphasised that the problem is not one which can be solved overnight. Real improvement can be secured only by a continuous programme urgently and insistently carried out over a number of years. The objective of the recommendations is that by the end of ten to fifteen years the total smoke in all heavily populated areas will be reduced by something of the order of 80 per cent. This will mean a degree of freedom from air pollution which many parts of the country have not known for more than a century. With regard to gaseous pollution, there is not yet the knowledge to deal effectively with the whole problem; but recommendations for preventive action are suggested and research projects recommended. It is basic to all the recommendations that at the outset it should be made the declared national policy to secure clean air, and that a 28 statement to this effect should find expression in new legislation, a "Clean Air Act." The nature and effects of air pollution. The Interim Report, published in December, 1953, describes in some detail the nature and amounts of air pollution at present in this country:— (i) the most serious problem is the pollution which arises from the combustion of fuel (coal, oil and their products); (ii) the effects are most severe, and the need for prevention is most urgent, in the "black areas." These are the urban areas which are liable both to heavy pollution and to natural fog; (iii) a distinction can be drawn between visible pollution by smoke, grit and dust, and pollution by invisible gases, the most important of which are the oxides of sulphur ; (iv) more than half of all the smoke comes from industrial sources and railways, but for each ton of coal burnt domestic chimneys produce twice as much smoke as industry and discharge it at a lower level; (v) nearly all the grit and dust comes from industrial sources, including power stations and railways; (vi) sulphur dioxide is discharged wherever coal, coke or oil is burnt, whether in industrial or domestic premises; The effects on health. Whilst scientific evidence about the effects of air pollution on human health is incomplete, enough is known to make it abundantly clear that it is injurious to both physical and mental wellbeing. The effects of the London fog of December, 1952, which resulted in the deaths of some 4,000 people, have been the subject of a recently published report by an expert committee appointed by the Minister of Health. The Beaver Report deals rather with the consequences of the continuing air pollution persisting year in and year out over wide areas of the country. There is a clear association between pollution and the incidence of bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. Statistics show that every year the death rate from bronchitis in England and Wales is much higher than in other 29 European countries for which reliable figures are available. The following table shows comparative death rates from bronchitis for England and Wales and the Scandinavian countries:— Death rates from Bronchitis per 100,000. Males. Females. Denmark 1951 2.2 1.9 Norway 1951 5.5 5.8 Sweden 1951 5.0 4.0 England and Wales 1951 107.9 62.7 1952 83.8 42.0 1953 91.9 47.6 Not all of the difference can necessarily be attributed to air pollution since other factors, for example, climate and housing conditions, play a part, but in general it is the industrial towns liable to heavy pollution where the highest death rates prevail. The Report deals with industrial smoke, grit and dust, sulphur pollution, domestic smoke and pollution of the atmosphere by the ever increasing growth of motor transport. Wembley is fortunate in not having many of the larger metallurgical works in the district or any gas works or the type of industry which causes considerable atmospheric pollution; we nevertheless still have troubles at times with smoke nuisance, to which the inspectors direct their attention. The Council are members of the National Smoke Abatement Society and at a meeting of local authority and corporate members of the South-East Division of the Society, it was decided to establish a Divisional Council to carry out activities and study the problems relating to atmospheric pollution in the area of the division. The South-East Division embraces the counties of Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, London, Middlesex, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Sussex. Wembley's representatives are Alderman C. H. Smith, O.B.E., D.L. and the Chief Sanitary Inspector and we were indeed honoured by having Alderman C. H. Smith elected as the Chairman of this division. 7. MASS RADIOGRAPHY. A meeting was called in November, 1953, presided over by the Mayor, when the 30 in¬Charge of Miniature Mass Radiography Unit No. 5A addressed representatives of 330 organisations in the Borough, giving details of the proposed visit of his Unit. The Middlesex County Council agreed to co-operate in publicity which consisted of posters, leaflets, advertisements in the press, the showing of slides in cinemas, loud speakers, and requests to doctors to send their patients for X-ray. The Mass Radiography Unit visited the Borough in January and February, 1954, and operated on six sites over periods varying from three days up to a fortnight; evening sessions were arranged in order to enable everyone to attend and booking centres were set up in various parts of the Borough for the convenience of the public. The Mayor officially opened the proceedings at the first site, British Oxygen Co. Ltd., on January 3rd, when he was the first person to be X-rayed. The six sites where the Unit operated were:— British Oxygen Co. Ltd. General Electric Co. Ltd. Selfridge's Sports Pavilion. Atcraft Ltd. Brotherhood Hall. Kingsbury Swimming Pool. A total of 12,023 people were X-rayed, of whom 19 were found to be cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis and 2 of bronchial carcinoma. 8. LAUNDRY FOR THE AGED. A scheme for laundering the night attire and bed linen of aged and incontinent people living in their own homes, commenced in April, 1954; it is administered by the Old Persons' Welfare Committee who receive an annual grant from the Council of £200 to cover the expenditure incurred. On application to the Medical Officer of Health for this service (from the professional person in attendance) a Home Nurse is asked to visit and complete a form of recommendation. After accepting the certificate, which is only valid for one month, the Public Health Department passes it on to the Geriatric Officer of the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee. The Hospital makes arrangements for the collection, washing and return of the laundry and 31 mits the account to the Old Persons' Welfare Committee. A fresh certificate is required by the Hospital each month if the laundry service is to continue, and shortly before expiration the Home Nurse revisits and issues a further certificate for another month, or, alternatively, a certificate to indicate that the service should cease. 9. RODENT. CONTROL. The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three "Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 558 premises were found to be infested and 739 premises were satisfactorily treated. The following details of sewer treatment have been provided by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. In March, 1954, a 10% test bait of sewer manholes was carried out. 340 manholes were baited and there were 2 complete "takes" and 18 partial "takes." In the treatment which followed 345 manholes were baited when there were 24 complete "takes" and 110 partial "takes." The corresponding figures for the 17th Maintenance Treatment carried out in October, 1954, were—manholes baited 329, complete "takes" 16, partial "takes " 72. No new developments in poisoning technique were introduced during the year but Warfarin which was used very extensively during 1953/54 has continued to produce good results. 32 STATISTICAL APPENDIX D.

During the year your medical officers have acted professionally for the Council, performing 47 clinical medical examinations of actual or potential staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This activity helps in the provision of a medically sound personnel for all activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual case of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficiency impossible without such a service. I am proud to record the loyalty and diligence displayed in the work of the Department, and I take this opportunity of thanking the whole staff for another year of conscientious effort. I would conclude by an expression of appreciation to all members of the Council, especially those who serve on the Health Committee and particularly the Chairman, for the admirable way in which they have directed the policy of the Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health. 49 Hendon Printing Works Ltd. 42/44, Victoria Road, N.W.4 Phone: SUNnyhill 1004 H.P.W. 31222
