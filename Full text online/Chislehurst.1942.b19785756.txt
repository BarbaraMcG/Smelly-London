HEALTH REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1942. Madam and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Health Report for the year 1942, this being the twentieth one presented by me as your Medical Officer of Health. The Report is again curtailed, and contains only such information as it is desirable to record. A rise in the Birth Rate took place, viz. 18.1 per thousand of population, as compared with 14.6 last year. The Death Rate showed a decrease for the year, this being 9.7 per thousand of population, as against 11.4 last year. A decrease also took place in the Infantile Mortality Rate, this being 38 per thousand registered births, as compared with 52 last year. Owing to the small numbers involved in this Rate, fluctuations are liable 10 occur. The year was a satisfactory one from the point of view of incidence of Infectious Disease. A large decrease in the number of cases notified took place, but this was chiefly due to the much smaller number of cases of Measles reported. In presenting this Report, I desire to thank the Council and all its Officers for the kind help and assistance they have given me. In particular, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the loyal and efficient services rendered by Mr. Allen, and all the members of the Public Health Department. I am, Madam and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. N. CAVE, Medical Officer of Health. 3 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE Chairman C. E. GAMON, Esq., J.P.

Infectious Disease. 974 visits were made to notified cases of infectious disease (diphtheria, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, etc.). On the removal of a case to the Isolation Hospital, the release from quarantine (home eases) or in other necessary cases, disinfection was immediately carried out by spraying rooms and their contents with formalin, and the clothing and bedding was steam disinfected at the disinfecting station. Public Library books found in any premises in which infectious or contagious disease occurred were also disinfected by formalin vapour in a special metal chamber. Certain articles have also been destroyed by fire. The disinfections carried out during the year were as follows:— Sprayed. Fumigated. Steam Disinfected.1 Destroyed.

Vermin. (i) Bed Bugs. During the year 46 complaints were received of infestation of premises by bed bugs. The number of houses and/or their contents found to be infested was 60 (including 4 in the Council's possession). In suitable cases, and on the request of tenant and owner, the disinfestation of the premises and contents were simultaneously carried out by the Department. In all other cases the premises were disinfested by the owners, and the contents by the tenants. In all necessary cases bedding was steam disinfected by the Department. The usual method of disinfestation insisted upon is to strip as much woodwork from walls, etc., as possible, seal the premises and use a sulphurous gas or spray with contact fluid. Close supervision was made of premises which had been disinfested, and tenants were given suitable advice and instruction on methods of prevention and destruction of vermin. 21 (ii) Rats and Mice. 960 visits were made to premises in connection with rat infestation. 143 complaints were received, and at 187 premises infestation was remedied. In order to assist those affected with rat, etc., infestation, especially in view of the difficult conditions prevailing during the year, a whole-time rat-catcher has been engaged since 1941. His services have been found very useful in dealing with this difficult problem. In addition to the work he carried out at the owner's or occupier's expense in dealing with rodents on private property, he also undertook similar duties on the properties in the possession of the Council. During the three months of his service he attended at 19 private properties, paying 18 visits for this purpose. 8. Food Inspection. (i) Meat Inspection.
