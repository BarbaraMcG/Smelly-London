During the past year the Vestry has held twenty-six General and Special Meetings, and twenty-seven Committee Meetings. Sewers Works. 3-inch pipe drain 8 feet 4 „ „ 38 „ 6 „ „ 739 „ 9 „ „ 642 „ 12 „ „ 1965 ,, 15 „ „ 910 „ Total 4302 Eleven gulleys, thirty-seven gratings, fifty-four drain mouths and two flushing shafts to sewers, havo been formed and constructed. 100 applications have been made to drain houses into sewers, including notices of intended new buildings, and plans checked and approved, comprising 229 houses and premises, 189 of which have been properly drained and completed, and forty are in progress. About forty cesspools have been done away with. A fifteen-inch pipe sewer, (about 492 feet) has been laid in the Deptford Old Lower Road, from the rear of the “Lion south wards, to the Earl sewer, and tho road-gulleys and house drains have been connected therewith. 12 660 feet of twelve-inch pipe sewer, has also been laid by the Vestry in Corbett's Lane, and the several house drains have been connected therewith by the Owners. Upon the execution of the sewers and drains in “ Southwark Park," the Metropolitan Board of Works consented to the drainage of Clarehall Cottages and Place, Jamacia Level being taken into such sewers, and for that purpose a twelve-inch pipe sewer (432 feet) was laid by the Vestry at the rear of Clarehall Cottages, in the line of the old open ditch, and connected with the sewer in the Park. The drainage of the houses, Clarehall Cottages and Clarehall Place, is now being carried out by the Owners, by combined drains into the beforementioned pipe sewer. The works of the East London Railway having necessitated certain alterations of the drainage at China-hall Place, Providence Place, Portland Place, Baltic Place, &c., the works required have been carried out by the Contractor to the Vestry, under the direction of the Surveyor of Sewers, and the cost thereof charged to the East London Railway Company. A letter from the clerk to the Metropolitan Board of Works, having been received by the Vestry, calling attention to the evil resulting from the practice of sweeping road refuse into the sewers, through the street gullies, the Vestry directed their Surveyor of Pavements to see that the Labourers employed did not sweep the road slush into the road gullies. Paving Works. The following works have been done with new and old stone, from March, 1867 to March, 1868:— New carriage-paving laid 137 tons. Old carriage-paving relaid 2771 yards.

The carriage-ways and foot-ways, Corbett's-lane and Debnam's-road, Rotherhithe Newroad, have been repaved and made up by the Vestry, and the cost thereof apportioned amongst the owners of property therein, after deducting a contribution mado by tho Vestry of one-third part of such cost. The carriage-way, Rotherhithe-street, has been taken up and relaid at the following plaees, viz.:— from the Surrey Consumers' Gas Works to the "Surrey Dock Tavern," also from Hull Head Dock to the King and Queen Granary. The carriage-way, Rotherhithe-wall, between the "India House'' Public-house and the west gateway to Messrs. Perks's Mill, has been also taken up and relaid. Two paved crossings, six feet wide, have been formed in the carriage-way, Russell-street, viz. :—one from the north foot-way of Lower York-street across to Randell's Rents, and one from Mr. Bolton's to the approach to Commercial Dock Pier, Thames-street. The Vestry have entered into a contract with Mr. Thomas Turner, of King's-road, Chelsea, to pave the carriage-way and foot-ways, Union-road, and that portion of the carriage-way, Deptford Lower-road, extending from the " Royal Oak " Public-house, to the Surrey Commercial Dock entrance, according to a tender and schedule of prices accepted by the Vestry; the work was commenced on the 1st May, 1868, and is now (June, 1868) in active progress. The surveyor's estimate of the cost of the work, amounted to £8,410 3s. 2d , and, in order to meet the expense, the Vestry have, with the consent of the Metropolitan Board of Works, obtained a loan of £8,000, from Mr. Robert Lawrence, of Ware, Herts, upon mortguge of the paving and general purposes rates of this parish, such loan to be repaid by twenty annual instalments, with interest, at the rate of £5 per cent. per annum. Lighting. During the past year, eight new lamps have been set up, viz.:—four in Rotherhithe Newroad (viz.:—one opposite Corbett's-lane, one at the angle of the Branch-road, one opposite Dartmouth-road, and one under the South Kastern Railway arch), one in Debnam's-road, one in CorbettVlane, one in Maynard-road, and one in Commercial Dock-road, making the total number of lamps in this parish, lighted under the contract with " The Surrey Consumers' Gas Company," 362. (For further particulars of contract see page 6.) Cleansing, Watering, &c. The Vestry have entered into a new contract with Mr. Joseph Parsons, for three years, for the supply of men, horses and carts, at per day, for the cartage of the cleansings from the Mainroads. after the same have been swept up by the Vestry 's labourers, and to a shoot provided by the Vestry. Mr. Alfred Thomas Hobman, is the contractor for removing the cleansings from the streets, other than the Main-roads, at per day, for man, horse and cart; he also contracts for the supply of horses, harness and drivers, to tho Vestry's water-carts for wutering tho whole of the roads and streets of the parish. E 14 The Vestry have made an alteration in the staff of labourers employed in cleansing and watering the roads and streets, and the present arrangement is as follows :—viz. A Ganger and five men are employed for cleansing and watering the parish streets and roads, and a Ganger, and six men for cleansing and watering the Main-roads, formerly known as the Turnpike-roads. An arrangement has also been made, whereby the Guardians of the Poor have taken upon themselves the entire supervision of the pauper labour in the Stone Depot, and the payment for the same, which arrangement supersedes the former system, whereby the Vestry used to employ and pay the casual poor, sent to the stoneyard by the Relieving Officer. The Guardians also purchase unbroken stone, which, when broken by the applicants for relief, is taken by the Vestry for the repair of the roads, at the current price. The Vestry have entered into an agreement with the Vestry of Bermondsey, whereby this Vestry have to maintain, cleanse and water all that part of the carriage-way of the Manorroad southward of the north corner of Roseberry-street; also all that portion of the carriage-way, Rotherhithe New Road eastward of the west corner of Hyson-road, the Vestry of Bermondsey taking for the same purposes all the remainder of the said Roads respectively northward and westward of the before-mentioned points: such agreement to terminate after six months' notice to that effect from cither Vestry to the other.

Miscellaneous. The Vestry in June, 1867, upon the recommendation of a Committee appointed to investigate into the matter, made the following resolutions with respect to Rates in arrear, viz:— That for the future the names of all persons in arrear be entered in the succeeding Ratebooks, and that there be only two Rates in collection at one time. That all the persons who have not paid the last preceding Rate, within six weeks after the confirmation of the then present Rate, be forthwith summoned, and that such principle be adopted in all succeding Rates. It appearing, by the basis for the County Rates, as prepared by the Justices for the County of Surrey, that it was proposed to raise the assessment of this parish, from £83,539 to £126,000. The Vestry appointed a Committee to appeal against such basis, which Committee prepared grounds of objection and attended before the Justices with same, but could obtain no reduction in the amount which was ultimately fixed at £126,000 for this parish. The Vestry being desirous of obtaining the settlement of several questions that had arisen as to the working of "The representation of the People Act, 1867, "with respect to 17 the Qualification of Vestrymen, the making, assessing, and collecting of the Parochial Rate, &c., they obtained the opinion of Mr. Mellish, Q.C., thereon, which will be found in the Appendix hereto annexed. (No. 3.) The Vestry presented a petition to the House of Commons through John Locke, Esq. M.P., untying for the repeal or modification of the seventh section of "The Representation of the People Act, 1867, so as to enable Owners of small property to compound for Parochial Rates, as heretofore. Memorials have been presented by the Vestry to the Lord Lieutenant of the County of Surrey, urging the appointment of Charles Churchill, Esq , and Cyrus Legg, Esq., as Justices of the Peace for the County, to act in conjunction with John Mews and Henry Sterry, Esquires, in transacting the Parochial business of this parish, requiring the assistance of Magistrates. The Vestry memoralised the Secretary of State for the Home Department against the Bills introduced into Parliament last Session, entitled "The Municipal Corporation (Metropolis) " and Metropolitan Municipal Government." The first-mentioned Bill, having for its object the establishment of a Central Municipal Corporation, in lieu of the Metropolitan Borad of Works, and the latter Bill the establishment of Municipal Corporations in the several Parliamentary Horoughs in the Metropolis, in lieu of the Vestries and District Boards. Ultimately the firstmentioned Bill was withdrawn, the promoters not having complied with the standing orders of the House of Commons, and the latter was negatived without a division. The Vestry presented a petition to the House of Commons through John Locke, Esq., MP., in support of " The Metropolis Gas Hill. The Vestry of this parish having arranged to co-operate with the Vestry of Bermondsey in carrying out an improvement at Jamaica Level, they have agreed with Mr. Back, the leaseholder, for the purchase of his interest in the portion of the Mill-stream and banks from Union Bridge southward, to Swan Bridge, for the sum of £50, and the Vestry are also in negotiation with Sir William Gomm, the ground landlord, for the freehold of the said site, for the purpose of throwing the same into the public way, the Vestry of Bermondsey having for the same purpose purchased the site of the old Toll-house, Jamaica Level, and as soon as the preliminaries aro settled the improvement works will bo carried out jointly by the two V entries. Upon the rebuilding of the houses, destroyed by fire, in Rotherhithe-street near Lavenderlane, the Vestry arranged with the owner (Mr. Chambers), to set back the same about two feet for the improvement of the street at that spot, which has been done at a cost to the parish of £71 10s. 0d. The Metropolitan Board of Works having, on the 1st of July, 1867, under the provisions of the "Fire Brigade Act, 1865 " taken possession of all the fire-escapes in the Metropolis, the two fire-escapes in this parish have since that time been under the control of that Hoard, and this Vestry have been relieved from the payment to "The Royal Society for tho Protection of Life from Fire "of the contribution (£160) towards their maintenance, such contribution being covered by the amount paid by this parish to the Metropolitan Hoard of Works for the purposes of the before-meutioned Act. Measrs. Hyaas and Son having applied to be allowed at their own expense to extend the F 18 two Rights of Way on either side of their premises, Trinity-street, out about ninety-feet into the River, and level with their proposed New Wharf, the Vestry approved of their application upon Messrs. Byass undertaking to form a flight of stone or iron steps at the River-end of the way on the south side, and to properly fence the boundaries of both the ways to the satisfaction of the Vestry; also upon condition that the New Wharf be kept throughout its entire length 4 feet 6 inches above Trinity high-water level. The Vestry approved of the application made by Mr. James Naylor for permission to extend his Coal Wharf, Rotherhithe-wall, out 13 feet into the River, provided he also continued the parish Right of Way to the River opposite the north end of West Lane, out level with his proposed New Wharf, and flush with Mr. Clift's building on the west side of the Right of Way, and left the said way of the same width as heretofore. A letter from the Secretary of State having been received by the Vestry, at the latter end of December, 1867, to the effect that it was possible, owing to the designs of wicked and evil-disposed persons the ordinary Police force of the Metropolis might be found insufficient in number to perform the duties required by them, and requesting that the Vestry would lose no time in inviting all well-disposed persons to come forward and enrol themselves as Special Constables, to assist the police in the preservation of the Peace, and in affording protection to life and property, John Mews and Henry Sterry, Esquires, two of the Magistrates for this County, attended, and 728 of the inhabitants of this parish voluntarily came forward and were duly sworn in as Special Constables, and at a meeting of the Special Constables, afterwards held, a staff was appointed, and Districts and Rallying Points were assigned, as follows, viz.— MAJOR JAMES PAYNE, Chief Superintendent.

From 25th March, 1867, to 31st March, 1868. To the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Swrey. Gentlemen, Until the last few years the state of sanitary knowledge was not satisfactory, and the subject failed to excite much interest in the mind of the general public; the medical part of the community have always contended, that the prevention of disease was better than its cure, and have from time to time enunciated those views, and carried them into operation, as far as they had power and opportunity. The indifference of the public, has been in some measure overcome by the destructive effects of some severe epidemic diseases, which have appeared amongst us, aided by the exertions, for a series of years, of a few earnest and philanthropic men, who have been engaged in effecting a remedy for this defect in our social system. Various Legislative enactments in relation to Collieries and Factories, the Interment of the Dead, the Health of Towns, Nuisances removal, the preservation of large spaces for the People, the supply of Water, purity of Gas, and recently more comprehensive Acta of Parliament have been passed, which have excited very hopeful feelings in the minds of those engaged in the work of sanitary improvement. We have reason to believe that in ordinary times a great saving of human life has been effected by the operation of the laws already alluded to, and that the power of severe epidemic diabases has been mitigated by the introduction of our sanitary laws. In the year 1866, when we experienced an outbreak of Asiatic Cholera, London and its suburbs, except the Eastern district, were lightly visited by it, and we have ground to conclude that the combined and systematic arrangements that were made in different localities to combat the disease, were attended with great success. 20 The past year has been characterised by two circumstances which are regarded as unquestionable proofs of the prosperity and sound sanitary state of a district; an increase of births, and a very large decrease of deaths, the diminution of deaths, cannot be accounted for by the idea entertained by some persons, that a favourable state of health, immediately after a severe epidemic, is to be explained by the disease having removed by death a large number of weakly and aged persons; inasmuch as during the year 1866, the deaths by epidemic cholera amounted to twenty-one, which must be considered a small number, compared with population. We must, therefore, look to other causes for the improved health of the Parish, and give a fair portion of credit to the sanitary measures which have been in operation for a series of years. We shall not be far from correct in calculating the population of this Parish at twentyeight thousand five hundred, and in forming this estimate, we must consider that a moving population, consisting of Seamen, and persons casually employed, amounting to about two thousand, must be added to the fixed population of twenty-six thousand five hundred. The births registered during the year amounted to 1007, 527 Males and 480 Females ; being an increase of thirty-nine over the former year, and 477 over deaths. The usual quarterly and annual tables are annexed, and will show that from March 25th, 1867, to June 24th, 139 deaths were registered ; from June 24th, to September 29th, 135; from September 19th, to December 25th, 138 ; from December 25th, 1867, to March 25th, 1868, 118. Total 530. Coroner's Inquests were held on the bodies of fifty persons, and twenty-three of that number were non-residents in the parish. Twenty-six deaths were occasioned by Drowning. The death of the oldest person registered was that of a female aged eighty-seven years. It is my purpose in future to consider the year to commence on April 1, and terminate on March 31, of the following year; according to this calculation eighteen births, seven Males and eleven Females, and eight deaths must be added to the above number. Deaths arising from five of the most common epidemic diseases were 21 less than in the previous year; by three of the chief diseases of the lungs, 45 less, and as no death was caused by Cholera, 22 lives are gained from that source; the total, 88 in number, nearly approaches the very large diminution of deaths amounting to nearly 100, which has taken place during the past year. A very important means of benefiting public health is to be derived from improving the habitations of the poor, and preventing too many persons from occupying houses or rooms. The comparative rate of mortality, during the last three years, will be seen by the following statement:— No. of deaths. Corrected mortality. Deathrate. From March 25, 1865, to March 24, 1866 581 537 20-14 do. 1866 do. 1867 621 600 2M2 do. 1867 do. 1868 530 507 17-14 21 It is the misfortune of the poorer classes to be the first sufferers by epidemic diseases, and from this source they usually spread to other classes of the community. The Vestry at one time gave hopeful signs of feeling the importance of the matter, but our efforts in this direction have been crippled by the want of necessary assistance. One hundred and sixty-two notices have been served for the removal of nuisances, we have had to deal with dilapidated and dirty houses, defective drainage, foul accumulations of fluid matte r and manure, and illegal keeping of Pigs ; in every case tho service of a notice was sufficient to cause the removal of the nuisance, and no summons has been issued during the past year. A long-standing nuisance is nearly abolished, by the piping and partial filling in of the Surrey Mill-stream. The water-supply has not been satisfactory in the Western Division of the Parish, numerous complaints are usually made in the spring and summer portions of the year, but during past year they have been more loud and frequent; several communications with the Company on the subject received very little courtesy, nor were they attended with much effect. The Slaughter-houses have been inspected from time to time, and with one or two exceptions. they were found in a satisfactory state. The condition of the Bakehouses was not to be complained of, but the Vestry deemed it necessary to present a copy of the Act of Parliament to every Baker in the Parish, to make him acquainted with the obligation to keep his Bakehouse clean, and lime-whiten it periodically In closing my remarks on the circumstances attending the first complete year of my duty, as your Medical Officer, I cannot help expressing the gratification I feel in being enabled to state such a very satisfactory condition of the Parish ; it has been the custom even in quarters supposed to be well informed, to pronounce Rotherhithe an unhealthy place, but the facts disclosed in this report must necessarily remove such a mistaken opinion. With your kind assistance, and the zealous co-operation of those who are associated with me in the work of sanitary improvement, I trust we shall see a farther reduction of the death-rate.

CLAY, Chairman. ERNEST o. COE, CHARLES J B. HERTSLET, Auditors. 29 APPENDIX No. 3. Copy Opinion of Mr. Mellish, Q.C., upon case submitted by order of the Vestry of Rotherhithe, January, 1868. QUESTION. 1. Whether those gentlemen who have been elected Vestrymen and whose qualification is now under £25 rating, can still act as Vestrymen up to the end of the term of their election ? ANSWER. 1. I am of opinion that those gentlemen who have been elected Vestrymen and whose qualification is now under £25 rating, cannot still act up to the end of the term of their election. 2. Whether, if such gentlemen cannot act as Vestrymen, they are still Vestrymen de jacto, and consequently no further election can be made untill the expiration of their term of office, should they not resign or die? 2. I am of opinion that such gentlemen hare ceased to be Vestrymen. It is true that under section 54 the becoming disqualified is not stated as one of the grounds of ceasing to be a Vestryman; but 1 think it would be held that under section 6 a person who ceases to be rated to the proper amount ceases to be a Vestryman The section says, that the Vestry shall consist of persons rated to the specified amount, which seems to me equivalent to saying that other persons cannot be or remain members of the Vestry. 8. Whether any gentleman who was a Vestryman previous to the month of October, 1867, but who, in consequence of the taking away of the compounded ratings, then ceased to be rated at a sufficient amount (£25), but who upon the supplemental rate made January, 1868, has now acquired a rating of £25, is in consequence eligible to come back and retake his seat at the Vestry. 3. I am of opinion, for the reasons already stated, that the persons referred to in the question cannot come buck and retake their seats unless they arc re-elected. 4. Can the Vestry apply to the Metropolitan Board of Works to have the Parish divided into Wards under the 41st sec. of 25 and 26 Vic., c. 102, and if so, are they bound to do this ? 4. 1 am of opinion that if the Parish did not contain more than 2000 rated householders at the time of the census of 1861, no application to divide the Parish into Wards can be made until the next census. I think the parish is clearly not bound to make the application. 5. If not can the Inhabitants elect 36 more Members under the second section of 18 and 19 Vic., c. 120, and if so, are they buund to do this? and when should the election take place? See sec. 7, 10, 20. 5. I am of opinion that there is no power in the inhabitants to elect 36 more members under the 2nd section of the 1 *tli and 19th Vic c. 120. I think that section only refers to the number originally to be elected, and 1 cannot find any section which gires a power to increase the original number. I 30 6. Are the provisions of the 10th Geo. IV., c. 131, or any of them, applicable towards the making, assessing, collecting, allowing and appealing against rates in this Parish, or do these provisions only refer to properties compounded ? 6. I cannot find any provisions of the 10th Geo, IV., c. 131, which are now applicable, some of the clauses appear to relate to landlords of furnished lodgings, who did not compound; but as far as I can see it leaves them in the same position as they would be without the Act. 7. Can the landlord who lets his house to A, who underlets to B, C, D and E, claim to have his house rated in his (the landlord's) name ? 7. I am not aware of any section which enables such a landlord as is reefrred to in the section to be rated. 8. Can houses rated to the landlord under the provisions in the 7th sec. of 30 and 31 Vic., c. 102, be compounded for in accordance with the provisions of 10th Geo. IV. c. 131 ? 8 I am of opinion that houses rated to the landlords under the provisions of the 7th section of the 30th and 31st Vic , c. 102, cannot be compounded for in accordance with the provisions of the 10th Geo. IV., c. 131. 9. Can the landlord and tenant make any legal arrangement by which the landlord can be rated for and pay the tenant's rates ? See 30 and 31st Vic., c. 102, ss. 7 and 49. 9. I am of opinion that a landlord and tenant cannot, by any arrangement between themselves, prevent the tenant from being rated and from being liable to the Parish for the rate; but they may make any arrangement they please as to which of them should pay the rate, provided the arrangement be not made corruptly, contrary to the 49th section. 10. Does the 7th sec. of 30 and 31st Vic., c. 102, affect the compounding for the paving, lighting, and sewers rates as well as the poor rate ? See sec. 161, 18 and 19 Vic., c. 120. 10. I am of opinion that the 7th section of the 30th and 31st Vic.c. 102, does not affect the compounding for any rates except the poor rates. Wherever paving, lighting and sewers rates could have legally been compounded for before that Act, I think they may still legally be compounded for.
