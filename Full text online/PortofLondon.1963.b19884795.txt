AC :4369 PLON 71 119 CORPORATION OF LONDON PORT HEALTH AUTHORITY ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH To 31st DECEMBER, 1963. CONSTITUTION AND JURISDICTION The governing body of the City of London, the Corporation of London, was originally constituted the Sanitary Authority of the Port of London by Section 20 of the Public Health Act, 1872. The cost of administration was met from the Corporation's private funds for close on fifty years, when it became rate (and grant) aided. By the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the term "Port Sanitary" was changed to "Port Health", and the Port Health district is further defined by that Act as the "Port of London as established for the purposes of the law relating to the Customs of the United Kingdom" and by the Public Health Act, 1936 as "the Port as established for the purposes of the enactments relating to the Customs". The limits of the Port Health District of the Port of London were originally defined by a Treasury Minute dated 1st August, 1883. They commence at high water mark in the River Thames at Teddington Lock, in the County of Surrey, and extend down both sides of the said River Thames to an imaginary straight line drawn from the Pilot mark at the entrance of Havengore Creek in the County of Essex, to the Land's End at Warden Point, in the Isle of Sheppey, in the County of Kent, such point being the north-western limit of the Port of Faversham, and extend up and include both sides of the River Medway to an imaginary straight line drawn from the south-east point of land westward of Coalmouth Creek, thence across the said River Medway to the western-most point of the piece of land which forms the eastern side of Stangate Creek, or, in other words, the north-west point of Fleet Marsh and thence in a southerly direction to I wade Church in the said County of Kent, and thence in a north-easterly direction to Elmley Chapel in the said Isle of Sheppey, a supposed direct line from Elmley Chapel to Iwade Church, being the western limit of the Port of Faversham, and the said Port of London includes the Islands of Havengore Creek aforesaid, called Potton and Rushley Islands, and so much of the said Creek and Watercourses as extends from it to the town of Rochford, and also includes all other Islands, Rivers, Streams, Creeks, Waters, Watercourses, Channels, Harbours, Docks and places within the before-mentioned limits contained. The Port of London Authority with which the Port Health Authority works in close cooperation, was established as the administrative body of the Port of London including the docks and tideway of the River Thames, by Act of Parliament in 1909. January, 1964. To, THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COMMONERS OF THE CORPORATION OF LONDON My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my first Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London. As I took up my appointment on the 1st January, 1964, all the work described was carried out under my predecessor, Dr. J. Greenwood Wilson, the first holder of the combined post of Medical Officer of Health for the Port and City of London. A letter from the Secretary, Ministry of Health, dated November, 1963, indicated that the Medical Officer of Health should prepare his Annual Report in accordance with Form Port 20. Paragraph 5 of this Form reads as follows:â€” "The information required by Sections I, V, VI, VIII, XlVand XVI,which has been given in an earlier report and has not since changed, need not be repeated each year. A recapitulation of all information should be made in the Report for the years 1952 and 1955 and thereafter quinquennially. For the intermediate years only ctije changes which have occurred during the year covered by the Report need be mentioiy ctions; if there is no change "No Change" should be entered". This Report ha&^en prepared. in Accordance with the above directive. The following is a summary of the principal items mentionedJAN.65 ) Shipping The number of vessels arriving in the Port of London during 1963 was &.939, from foreign ports and 10,443 coastwise. The total tonnage of these vessels was^9~Sw^hl net tons as compared with 46,267,832 net tons in 1962. The Boarding Medical Officers visited 1,667 vessels from foreign ports and 6 coastwise ships. The Port Health Inspectors made io,Z49 inspections of vessels, 12,535 of which were foreign going, 1,945 coastwise and 769 inland navigation. Water Supplies Regular sampling of water supplies for ships was continued during the year and an incident of contaminated water in the Millwall Docks was dealt with. During the year considerable improvement was effected in the methods of stowage of hoses and nozzle equipment for ship's water supplies. Communicable Diseases On 1st August the Public Health (Ships) (Amendment) Regulations, 1963, came into force enabling port health officers to require the production of International Certificates of Vaccination against smallpox by persons arriving in this country from foreign ports. From 15th of May until 5th August,- Stockholm was declared a smallpox infected local area. During this period all passengers and crews arriving from the infected area were checked to ensure that they were in possession of valid International Vaccination Certificates and if not were either vaccinated or placed under surveillance. 299 cases of notifiable and other infectious diseases were reported as having occurred on 150 vessels. 223 of these cases were dealt with in the Port. 107 cases were admitted to various hospitals, including 43 to the Port Isolation Hospital at Denton, near Gravesend. Full precautionary measures were taken in respect of a ship reported to have landed a case of suspected smallpox abroad. Special investigations were undertaken in connection with cases of gastro-enteritis (one fatal) and food poisoning and one case of leprosy was dealt with. Rodent Control During the year 3,131 rats, 1,541 in ships and 1,590 in shore premises were destroyed in the Port of London. In addition 2,601 mice were destroyed, 146 in ships and 2,455 in shore premises. 89 rats were examined for plague with negative results. 5,408 inspections of lighters for evidence of rodents were made. International Deratting and Deratting Exemption Certificates The number of deratting certificates issued to ships was 39, the method of deratting in 35 instances being poisoning with Sodium Fluoroacetate (1080). 1,069 deratting exemption certificates were granted. Shellfish The shellfish industry in the Thames Estuary was minimal during the year because of the severe winter. No cases of food poisoning resulting from the consumption of shellfish gathered in the area were reported. 1 Medical Inspection of Aliens and Commonwealth Immigrants During the year 165 aliens and 1,333 Commonwealth Immigrants were examined by the Medical Inspectors. The arrangements whereby the larger passenger ships are boarded by the Medical Inspectors with the Immigration Officers at Brixham was continued and worked effectively. Pigeon Control With the co-operation of the Port of London Authority and occupiers of dock premises systematic control measures were carried out to keep the pigeon population at a reasonable level. Canal Boats 10 inspections of canal boats were made during the year. 4 defects were found on 3 boats. Clean Air Act, 1956 During the year 36 infringements were observed. A prosecution was taken in one case unsuccessfully. Transport of Refuse by Lighters A few minor infringements of the bye-laws were noted. In one case successful legal proceedings were taken. Houseboats No difficulties were encountered during the year. 19 houseboats were licensed to be moored at Benfleet in accordance with the Essex County Council Act, 1952. Sanitary Accommodation at the Docks The Port of London Authority are in process of modernising sanitary accommodation at the docks and considerable improvements were made during the year. Launches The launch "Alfred Robertson", which has been in continuous service for 26 years, is to be replaced. The new launch will be slightly larger so that it will be capable of acting as a relief, in cases of emergency, for the cutter "Humphrey Morris" on the Gravesend Boarding Station. Visitors and Students Visitors and students, for the most part doctors, and public health inspectors, from many countries visited the Port for instructions in and demonstrations of port health work. Students for the Diploma examination for Public Health Inspectors were also taken for instruction in port health work. Food Hygiene (Dock Carriers, etc.) Regulations, 1960 During the year progress was made in raising the standard of hygienic handling of food cargoes and appreciable improvements achieved in the cleanliness of the vehicles used for the transport of food. Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960-1962 During the early part of the year a survey of the passenger-carrying launches which operate summer services on the River was carried out. Altogether during the year 47 inspections were carried out in connection with these Regulations and the few defects noted were dealt with without taking legal action. Dangerous Drugs Twenty-six certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued under the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1953. Imported Food The total amount of foodstuffs seized and condemned as unfit for human consumption and either reconditioned or disposed of for animal feeding or for industrial purposes under guarantee or destroyed or re-exported was 6,614 tons 10 cwts. 2 qrs. 22 lbs. as compared with 5,065 tons 3 cwts. 3 qrs. 9 lbs. in 1962. Fertiliser and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1926 Six samples of Feeding Stuffs and two samples of Fertilisers were submitted to the Agricultural Analyst. Finally, I wish to record appreciation of the collaboration and assistance rendered by Her Majesty's Customs, the Pilots, the Immigration Officers, the Port of London Authority, the Shipping Federation, the staffs of Shipping Companies and Merchants, the staffs of the Central 2 Public Health Laboratory, the "Dreadnought" Seamen's Hospital and St. Andrew's Hospital, the Public Analyst, the Emergency Bed Service, the Regional Hospital Boards and Hospital Management Committees concerned, and all those who have so generously and willingly helped in every aspect of port health work throughout the year, particularly the Chairman, members and staff of the Port and City of London Health Committee.

The Port of London trades with all parts of the world. SECTION IV INLAND BARGE TRAFFIC Numbers and tonnage using the district and places served by the traffic. These barges are of all types and are registered annually with the Port of London Authority. They number approximately 7,000 and their tonnage is some 500,000. The traffic of these craft extends throughout the length of the Port while a number of them are employed carrying goods and merchandise via the canals to all parts of the country. SECTION V WATER SUPPLY 1. Source of supply for:â€” (a) The District â€” No change. (b) Shipping â€” No change. 2. Reports of tests for contamination: â€” It is very desirable that samples at normal temperature be delivered at the laboratory as early as possible and not later than six hours after they have been drawn. Previously, samples had been taken to the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale or to Devonport Pathological Laboratory at Greenwich, according to the prevailing circumstances, while the Public Health Laboratory at Maidstone had examined samples from the Medway. However by courtesy of the North East Metropolitan Hospital Board, arrangements were made for bacteriological tests of water samples from supplies within the Port to be undertaken by the laboratory at St. Andrew's Hospital Bow. Accordingly samples drawn from the supplies in Docks on the north bank of the River were sent to Bow, while those from the south bank supplies and vessels moored in the River were sent to Greenwich. The first test of the new arrangements arose soon afterwards when routine samples drawn from hydrants in Millwall Dock and despatched to Bow were found to be grossly polluted with faecal organisms. In order to trace the source of pollution, many samples were taken at intervals while processes of elimination continued. Eventually, this gross contamination was traced to a 7 fractured supply pipe laid below the tidal level of the dock water. The hydrants were put out of service and were not used to supply ships until repairs were completed, the new pipes cleansed and chlorinated, and several samples proved the water to be potable. 3. Precautions taken against contamination of hydrants and hosepipes: â€” Since a Code of Practice was introduced a few years ago and agreed by the Port of London Authority, there has been a trend towards replacing all the wooden boxes, situated at convenient watering points throughout the Docks, by suitable metal containers, to provide more hygienic stowage for hoses and nozzle equipment. It is encouraging to find that the principles of the Code of Practice are consistently upheld and those engaged in the work are more conscious of their responsibilities. 4. Number and sanitary conditions of water-boats and powers of control by the Authority:â€” One more boat has been put into service in the Medway and it will supply fresh water to ships in the Port of Rochester as well as those moored in the London Port Health Authority District which includes the Isle of Grain, thus coming intermittently under the jurisdiction of this Authority. While under construction and fitting out, the boat and equipment were inspected by a Senior Port Health Inspector who satisfied himself and reported that the construction, design and equipment were compatible with modem practice. There has been no change in the powers of control of water-boats by this Authority and the general standard of the water-boats in service is very satisfactory. The need for constant supervision of water supplies has always been stressed where potable water is concerned. Generally, it is not the purity of the initial supply that is in question but the temporary storage and delivery service. Tanks, hydrants and hose equipment are involved. Everything associated with these aspects must be strictly controlled and hygienically maintained if the end product is to be a clean and wholesome water supply. The percentages of 'Satisfactory* 'Good' and 'Excellent' samples in aggregate for the years 1960, 1961 and 1962 respectively amounted to 80.4%, 95.0% and 98.11%, thus indicating the high standard of purity maintained in this Port. Although the figure for 1963 has dropped to 89.06% (see table 2 below) it is not to be assumed that it represents a proportional decline in the high standard hitherto maintained, because the numerical drop is, in fact, attributable to the polluted water incident at the Millwall Dock already mentioned where 22 samples were drawn and found to be unfit before the cause of the pollution was discovered.

List of infected areas â€” No change. 2. Radio messages - No change. 3. Notification otherwise than by radio â€” No change. 4. Mooring stations â€” No change. 5. Arrangements for â€” (a) Hospital accommodation for infectious disease (other than Smallpox â€” see Section VII) â€” No change. (b) Surveillance and follow up of contacts â€” No change. (c) Cleansing and disinfection of ships, persons, clothing and other articles -No change. The Public Health (Ships) (Amendment) Regulations, 1963, came into effect on 1st August, 1963. These regulations amend the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1952 to 1961 and enable port health officers to require the production of International Certificates of Vaccination against smallpox. If a person is not in possession of such a certificate he may be offered vaccination, and may be placed under surveillance or in isolation. 9 SMALLPOX IN SWEDEN Stockholm was declared a smallpox infected local area in accordance with Article 3 of the International Sanitary Regulations, after confirmation on 15th May, of the diagnosis of a case in that area, and was pronounced 'free from infection' on 5th August. During this period it was necessary to maintain a rigid control on all vessels arriving from Sweden. In the summer season there is a regular service carrying approximately 350 passengers to and from Sweden (three return voyages per week), in addition to which U.S.S.R. vessels carry approximately 150 passengers from Leningrad via Stockholm weekly. These 4 ships berthed at Tilbury Landing Stage. In addition many smaller vessels arrived in the Port of London from Sweden. Instructions were issued to Boarding Medical Officers to the effect that all passengers and crew arriving from the infected area must be checked to ensure that they were in possession of valid International Vaccination Certificates or had been vaccinated recently, otherwise vaccination should be offered. Anyone who declined vaccination was to be placed under surveillance. All passengers and crew were to be questioned as to the likelihood of their having been in contact with one of the cases of smallpox and if so they were to be asked to complete a surveillance card giving their address in this country. Although this procedure was normally carried out by the Boarding Medical Officer at Gravesend, occasionally a ship was allowed to berth and the Port Health Inspector in the area carried out the necessary checking. Fortunately, the majority of passengers and crews had valid International Vaccination Certificates but nevertheless over 300 persons were placed under surveillance and many were vaccinated. The arrangements worked very smoothly and there was little, if any, delay to shipping. SECTION VII SMALLPOX 1. Name of Isolation Hospital to which smallpox cases are sent from the District. Long Reach Hospital is situated on the south bank of the River Thames about eight miles above Gravesend. The hospital consists of 10 ward blocks capable of accommodating 170 patients but, except in cases of emergency, only three ward blocks (2 of 20 beds and 1, a cubicle ward of 10 beds), total 50 beds, are kept available for immediate use. The hospital includes residential quarters for the staff and a laundry, although the administration and staffing is carried out from Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford. 2. Arrangements for transport of such cases to that hospital by ambulance giving the name of the Authority responsible for the ambulance and the vaccinal state of the ambulance crews. A case or cases of smallpox would be removed from the vessel by this Authority's Ambulance launch and conveyed ashore via the pontoon at Denton and from thence conveyed by road ambulance direct to Long Reach Hospital. The Port Health Authority would be responsible for the vaccinal state of their Ambulance Launch crews, while the vaccinal state of the Road Ambulance personnel would be the concern of the South-east Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board under whose jurisdiction both Joyce Green and Long Reach Hospitals fall. 3.

Facilities are available at the Virus Laboratory at the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. 10 SECTION VIII VENEREAL DISEASE Venereal Disease is not compulsorily notifiable to Medical Officers of Health but efforts are made both by the Boarding Medical Officers and the Port Health Inspectors to bring to the notice of seamen using the port the facilities available for free treatment and the importance of obtaining skilled treatment as early as possible. Should there be a known case, it is usually possible to arrange for the patient concerned to be taken at once to the nearest clinic of the Seamen's Hospital or other hospital in the vicinity of the ship.

"CLAN MACLACHLAN" On the 14th March, a cablegram was received from the Port Medical Officer at Gibraltar that an Asian seaman who was landed from the mv "Clan Maclachlan" at Gibraltar on 11th March with otitis media and sinusitis, was later diagnosed as suffering from suspected modified smallpox. The Ministry of Health was informed and a cablegram sent to the Port Medical Officer, Gibraltar, asking for confirmation of the diagnosis and requesting that samples be sent to the Public Health Laboratory at Colindale for examination. The ship had called at Calcutta on 21st February, Aden on 27th February and arrived in the Port of London on 15th March. The ship was contacted by radio telephone and the Boarding Medical Officer, together with two Port Health Inspectors and a Rodent Inspector proceeded down river in the cutter "Humphrey Morris" and boarded the shipoff Thames Haven at 2.15 p.m. All members of the crew - there were no passengers â€” were examined and together with the pilot were revaccinated. Those members of the crew who were going ashore in London were asked to give the addresses to which they were going and each was handed a pre-paid postcard for notifying any change of address within 14 days of leaving the ship. The bedding from the cabin occupied by the case and from the ships's hospital was removed for disinfection and the hospital was fumigated; the cabin was fumigated the next day when the ship was in dock. The ship caught the tide and docked at Tilbury Dock in the evening as scheduled. The names and addresses of members of the crew who were leaving the ship on the 16th March were posted on the morning of that day to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas to which they were proceeding. Subsequently a report was received from the Public Health Laboratory at Colindale that specimens of vesicle fluid and blood from the Asian seaman had been received from the Medical Officer of Health of Gibraltar and had been examined with the following results:â€” Gel diffusion test; Negative for variola vaccinia group; Egg culture test; Negative for variola virus. Medical Officers of Health who had been notified that members of the crew were proceeding to their areas and the Port Medical Officers of the ports at which the ship was calling on leaving London on 20th March were informed accordingly. GASTRO-ENTERITIS - m.v."NICHOLAS BOWATER" On the arrival at Gravesend of the m.v. "Nicholas Bowater" from Charleston (U.S.A.)via Rouen, on the 8th January, it was ascertained that ten Officers had suffered from Gastro-Enteritis. The first symptons became evident soon after the ship had left Rouen but quickly subsided, and when the vessel was boarded only the Captain and the 3rd Engineer still had residual symptoms. Instructions were given that fresh milk and vegetables taken on board at Rouen, where food poisoning had been suspect in recent months, were not to be used until investigations had been carried out and samples of milk, lettuce, apples and tomatoes were sent to Maidstone Laboratory for bacteriological examination. The results of the bacteriological examinations were negative and the outbreak was attributed to a virus infection which was very prevalent in most countries at that time. All ten cases remained on board and were kept under surveillance by the Boarding Medical Officers during the vessel's stay in London and all had recovered by the time the vessel sailed on the 11th January. FATAL CASE OF GASTRO-ENTERITIS -s.s."DEVON" During the homeward voyage from Australian ports to United Kingdom, via Suez Canal the 4th Engineer, age 23 years, became ill on 9th December and died four days later. He was buried at sea. The ship arrived at Aden on 18th December and samples of beef steak fillets were bacteriologically examined, from which CI. welchii was isolated. When the ship arrived at Liverpool on 1st January.no further incidents had arisen. However, the remaining beef steak fillets were removed from the Storeroom and an examination revealed CI. welchii, whereupon the steaks were destroyed by the Port Health Authority. It was decided at Liverpool to postpone a complete investigation until the ship arrived at London, the terminal port. This actually took place in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport and it was decided to allow the Port Health Authority a relatively free hand in the field of hygiene and bacteriological investigations. It was decided to take samples of all relevant foodstuffs from the ship's Provision Rooms and to transfer all meats to a Cold Store pending bacteriological examination results. Meanwhile, everything associated with the storage, preparation and cooking of meats was thoroughly cleansed with a solution of 'chloros' fumigated with formalin vapour and finally washed with clean water. All wooden surfaces were scraped and dunnage associated with the storerooms burned. 12 A total of 29 samples were taken of all suspected foods available and sent to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Colindale, with all relevant information relating to the investigation. The presence of CI. botulinum was not ruled out on account of the relatively short duration of illness and dramatic death. Except for two samples, all results proved negative. Salmonella Typhimurium was isolated from silverside and veal. This meat was subsequently destroyed under the supervision of the Port Health Authority and all remaining foodstuffs returned to the sterile and clean storerooms aboard. SUSPECTED FOOD POISONING - TANKER "VESTFONN" The Norwegian tanker "Vestfonn' arrived in the Thames on the 8th June having disembarked a man at Gibraltar suffering from Typhoid Fever. There was also a history of recurrent attacks of diarrhoea affecting nearly everyone else on board. On arrival the ship was directed to anchor at Holehaven where she was boarded by the Boarding Medical Officer and a Port Health Inspector who carried out a preliminary investigation before allowing the ship to go to her berth at Thameshaven. One man on board was still ill and he was removed to Denton Isolation Hospital for investigation and treatment. With the full co-operation of the owners and agents the ship was held at Thameshaven until Monday morning when the Boarding Medical Officer, two Port Health Inspectors and a Doctor from the Norwegian Embassy boarded her and took specimens from other members of the crew for bacteriological investigation. A thorough hygiene inspection of the ship was made. Some members of the crew were paid-off and repatriated to Norway and the ship proceeded to Rotterdam and from there to the Mersey and thence to Stanlow on the Manchester Ship Canal. Investigation at the Southend Laboratory revealed that two crew members were carriers of Sonne Dysentery Organisms and that one of these men was also a carrier of a Salmonella Organism but not Typhoid Bacilli. Most unfortunately he was a galley boy and since he handled the milk making machine in the galley there was a risk of infection spreading from this focus. This was borne out by the results of investigation of the reconstituted milk which showed considerable contamination. By the time these results were received, the ship had sailed, but the information was passed on to the Ports concerned for any action to be taken which they might think necessary. LEPROSY A request was received from the Surgeon of the m.v. "City of Port Elizabeth", lying at Royal Albert Dock, for a second opinion on a diagnosis of a seaman, age 43 years, who had been taken ill with a temperature and a rash. As a matter of urgency a Medical Officer of the Shipping Federation, Royal Albert Dock, was called in and the man was admitted to St. Anne's Hospital, Tottenham on a provisional diagnosis of exacerbation of old leprosy. The patient had spent 6 months in hospital in Jordan 6 years ago and was again admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in 1961 being treated for leprosy on both occasions. He was later repatriated to India but whether he was considered cured at that time is unknown. Fumigation of the native quarters and hospital of the "City of Port Elizabeth" was carried out with formalin and the bedding of the seaman was destroyed. St. Anne's Hospital reported on the 27th August that this man definitely had Erythema Nodosum Leprosi but was now fit for repatriation and arrangements were made with the Shipping Company accordingly. DENTON HOSPITAL Although Denton Hospital has been taken over by the South East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board under the National Health Services Act, the Port Health Authority continues to exercise, through the Senior and Assistant Port Medical Officers, the medical supervision of cases admitted to the hospital. The nursing and administrative control lies with the Dartford Hospital Management Committee. Consultant advice on difficult cases is available through the Physician-Superintendent of Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford, who whenever necessary transfers cases there for special investigation and treatment. 13 The number of cases admitted to Denton Hospital in 1963 was a follows:â€” Chickenpox 15 Chickenpox contact 1 Dysentery 3 Gastritis 1 Malaria 1 Measles 7 Measles Contacts 3 Miscellaneous 1 Mumps 2 Pyrexia of Unknown Origin 1 Quinsy 1 Scabies 1 Typhoid 1 Tonsillitis 5 43 SECTION X OBSERVATIONS ON THE OCCURRENCE OF MALARIA ON SHIPS Six cases of Malaria (three seamen and three passengers) were reported on ships during the year under review. This compares with twenty-one cases in 1962. Two passengers were well on arrival, two seamen were admitted to hospital on arrival in London, one passenger died on board and the body was landed at Port Tewfik, and one seaman was admitted to hospital at La Coruna. A notice giving advice on the Chief Precautions and Treatment of Malaria is issued by the Ministry of Transport and should be on board every British ship. SECTION XI MEASURES TAKEN AGAINST SHIPS INFECTED OR SUSPECTED OF PLAGUE No ships infected with or suspected of plague arrived during the year. SECTION XII MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS IN SHIPS FROM FOREIGN PORTS (1) Procedure for inspection of ships for rats The Port Health Authority employs sixteen Rodent Operatives working in conjunction with and under the supervision of the Port Health Inspectors. The Rodent Operative's first duty is to visit all ships arriving in his district to search for evidence of rodents, paying particular attention to vessels which have arrived from plague infected ports and to visit such vessels during the discharge of cargo and to ascertain that reasonable measures are adopted to prevent any rodents escaping ashore. His second duty, is the examination of ships in his area which are due for inspection under Article 19 of the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1952-63 and the Prevention of Damage by Pests (Application to Shipping) Order, 1951-6, relating to the granting of Deratting and Deratting Exemption Certificates and Rodent Control Certificates respectively. The Rodent Operative's third duty is the examination of shore premises and lighters for signs of rat infestation paying particular attention to premises adjoining the berths of vessels from plague infected ports, and lighters in the vicinity. Some twenty-one years ago the Port Health Authority instituted a Rodent Control Scheme in all docks and premises of the Port of London Authority on behalf of that Authority and in the premises of the tenants of the Authority on behalf of the occupiers. (2) Arrangements for the bacteriological examination of rodents, with special reference to rodent plague, including the number of rodents sent for examination during the year. 14 All rats for examination for plague, either by post mortem and subsequently, if necessary, by bacteriological examination, are promptly sent to the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. The bodies are placed in polythene bags which in turn are placed inside metal boxes, sealed and labelled so that there is no risk of the escape of any rat fleas during their transit to the Laboratory. The boxes are, of course, delivered by hand. The rat population of the Port is now so small and is under such strict control that it can be said to be almost certain that the arrival of a plague infected rat, even should it manage to get ashore, would be highly unlikely to have any serious significance. In other words, an epizootic could not be introduced into the Port for the simple reason that there are insufficient rats to enable the spread of infection. Nevertheless, eighty-nine rats were sent to the Laboratory and were examined for plague with negative results. (3) Arrangements in the district for deratting ships, the methods used, and if done by a commercial contractor, the name of the contractor. (a) The burning of sulphur at the rate of 31bs. per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a period not less than six hours. This method is seldom used in the Port of London. (b) The generation of hydrocyanic acid gas by various methods. For the destruction of rats a minimum concentration of HCN at the rate of 2ozs. per 1,000 cubic feet of space is required with a minimum of two hours exposure. (c) "1080" and "Warfarin". The employment of "1080" has been used regularly throughout the docks for some time with highly satisfactory results both on shore and in ships. A substantial number of ships have been deratted by this method in preference to the use of cyanide, resulting in a considerable saving of time and cost to the shipowner. Although satisfactory results have been obtained from the use of "Warfarin" a suitable baithas yet to be found, particularly in granaries, with which to mix the poison so that rats will take is continuously in preference to grain and other forms of cereal on which they are normally feeding. (d) Trapping. Trapping is seldom employed save for the destruction of isolated rats which have escaped a major poisoning operation or which have not yet established themselves. (e) Methyl Bromide. This is a very effective and lethal fumigant which has been used in this Port as an insecticide, particularly in the dry fruit industry. It has considerable penetrating powers and is not difficult to disperse after an operation. It is also possible to use this gas as a rodenticide and where there is an infestation of rodents and insects the combined problem can be solved with one operation. The following are the names of the firms approved for carrying out the deratting of ships:â€” London Fumigation Co. Ltd. Rentokil Laboratories Ltd. The P. & 0. Orient Line Contra-Pest Service Ltd. RODENT CONTROL ON LIGHTERS Rat-proofing, which in essence means the elimination of harbourages entirely or at least denying access by rats to such spaces that must remain, was continuously encouraged and an increasing percentage of craft inspected showed no indications of rats aboard. Harbourages usually consist of obscure spaces behind wooden linings and lockers into which the rats find or gnaw access and where they can breed with reasonable security. Having been denied access to these spaces, the rats resort to the bilges unless the drain holes at the bulkheads are restricted by a grill or perforated plate. Not all the lighters have been rat-proofed yet, but those that have not been so treated, mostly units of small fleets, are gradually being absorbed into larger businesses by which the principles of rat-proofing have already been accepted and put into practice. Naturally, the outstanding benefits have accrued to those lighters normally trading with rat attractive cargoes. During the year, experiments to determine the feasibility of installing permanent poison baiting measures with anti-coagulant substances were not successful and, apart from poisonbaiting on a few specific occasions, rodents were exterminated by fumigation with sulphur dioxide or methyl bromide. Where harbourages can be exposed, sulphur dioxide is a simple and effective rodenticide, otherwise the extra penetrating and lethal properties of methyl bromide are preferred. Incidentally, methyl bromide at high concentrations is becoming increasingly popular for disinsecting cargoes in lighters since any stray rodents are killed simultaneously. Nearly nine hundred such fumigations were carried out during the year and, as a result of close collaboration with the Industry, all facts and figures were submitted to the Port Health Authority for their information. 15 More than five thousand lighters were inspected despite severe wintry weather in the early part of the year. SUMMARY OF LIGHTER INSPECTIONS FOR YEAR 1963 Number of lighters inspected 5,408 Number of lighters without any evidence 4,811 Number of lighters with old and negligible fresh evidence 510 Number of lighters treated for rats 87 Number of dead rats recovered after treatment 732 Number of specimen rats sent to the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale for bacteriological examination 14 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON RODENT CONTROL The general technical pattern of rodent control which has been so successfully applied for the past decade has been continued and the policy of unrelenting suppression by swift, effective action maintained. The Rodent Control Scheme continues to provide the willing co-operation required without which the measure of success achieved could not have been attained. The enormous depredations once caused by rodents in this great seaport have been drastically curtailed and only an occasional rat is now reported where colonies thrived before. The population of rodents is kept to a low level by denying them as far as possible the three main environmental essentials to breeding, viz, subsistence, harbourage and free communication. Food and water are generally available, but progressive rodent-proofing of ships and shore premises together with improved sanitation in the docks reduces the scope of undisturbed breeding harbourages. No place attractive to rodents for breeding is insignificant when the fecundity of these pests is considered. The wide range of trading interests and transport organisation involved in the reception and distribution of merchandise in the port makes it vulnerable to continuous rodent infestation and therefore vigorous and systematic efforts by a competent staff, provided with the most effective means of extermination must be maintained. Palliatives are not sufficient in this field of pest control. 16 Table showing figures and statistics of Lighter Inspections for past ten years Year No. of Lighters Inspected % of Lighters without any Infestation % of Lighters with negligible Infestation % of Lighters treated No. of rats recovered after treatment Average No. of rats recovered per Lightertreated 1954 3267 86.8% 11.2% 2.0% 427 6.4 1955 3142 86.1% 10.4% 3.5% 820 7.3 1956 2492 84.0% 11.5% 4.5% 689 6.0 1957 3746 85.3% 10.4% 4.3% 849 10.9 1958 2714 87.9% 8.5% 3.6% 797 8.1 1959 2217 81.0% 13.2% 5.8% 723 5.7 1960 7207 86.3% 12.4% 1.3% 552 5.9 1961 6366 84.9% 13.5% 1.6% 848 8.1 1962 3793 86.8% 11.7% 1.5% 483 8.5 1963 5408 89.0% 9.4% 1.6% 732 8.4 Average 1954-1963 4035 85.8% 11.2% 3.0% 692 7.5 TABLE E Rodents destroyed (bodies recovered) during the year in ships and in shore premises (1) On vessels Number of Jan.

Two such Orders have been made. The first in 1936, covering the public and private layings bordering the part of the foreshore of the Estuary of the River Thames between Canvey Island and Shoeburyness; and the second, in 1957, covering the foreshore or waters bordering that part of the Estuary of the River Thames or any tributary thereof, between Garrison Point, SheernesB, and Warden Point in the Isle of Sheppey. The very severe winter had a disastrous effect upon the cockle beds and oyster layings in the Thames Estuary although some trade at Leigh did survive with a limited supply of cockles. Signs of hope and a little activity were evident in mid June at the oyster layings in the River Roach. It was anticipated that matters would improve as the Autumn approached, but progress continued very slowly and the supply was limited to the retail trade at Southend. It transpired that brood oysters, normally imported from France and Portugal, had also suffered during the winter and therefore the supply became difficult and expensive. Consequently, the oyster business was at low ebb during the year. The experimental layings and pits belonging to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food appeared to have suffered similarly and were almost without signs of activity. 18 The cockle trade however made a substantial recovery and the collection almost met normal seasonal demands. The 'sterilisation' centres at Leigh were kept under normal observation and found to comply fully with the requirements of the Order. There are eight processing establishments at Leigh which are conducted in a very satisfactory manner in respect of hygiene. These establishments cater for the processing of all the cockles gathered from the "prescribed area" and samples are taken regularly for bacteriological examination by the Public Health Department of the County Borough of Southend-on-Sea, after the cockles have been cooked, washed and made ready for sale. No cases were reported during the year of food poisoning or other illness resulting from the consumption of shellfish taken from layings within the district of the Port Health Authority.

List of other staff engaged on the work:- Clerical staff at the central Office. 3. Organisation of the work:â€” Aliens and Commonwealth Immigrants are medically examined, at the request of an Immigration Officer of the Home Office, on arrival in the Port by the Medical Inspector, who is either the Boarding Medical Officer or a part-time Medical Inspector called in to deal with a particular ship. A 24 hour a day boarding service is maintained at Gravesend. Since the inception of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act the larger passenger ships have been boarded at Brixham or Plymouth etc. 4.

No change. 19 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 The Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) (Vessels) Regulations, 1958 The progress in this field was steadily continued during the year, and the calls made upon the Inspectorate were not so heavy as previously. The policy initiated from the outset of prompt suppression of offensive emissions by every possible means, preferably other than by legal action, remained unaltered and this attitude has promoted goodwill in the international shipping industry. The regular shipping lines are fully aware of their obligations and it was seldom that a reminder was necessary, but it was quite natural to find spasmodic infringements among casual traders which have not assimilated the requirements of the Regulations, or where the installation is virtually incapable of proper combustion. Even so, there were those aggravating incidents where because of the human factor ships although properly equipped, contravened the Regulations. In order to ensure progress and to keep the goodwill of the Industry, it is necessary that the Inspectors should have sufficient technical knowledge and experience to evaluate the circumstances giving rise to dark smoke and to assess the claims of a 'defence' Wich may be advanced by the offenders. Some of the overall improvement is due to the extendc use of smokeless fuel on harbour installations and some to the displacement of old steam engines by internal combustion machinery. Nevertheless, most motorships are fitted with auxiliary steam boilers which must be kept in mind and the larger cooking ranges of passenger liners must not be overlooked. Both have given rise to difficulties from time to time. The stage has been reached in this Port when any dark smoke emission is immediately conspicuous and the port area community equally conscious of the offence, therefore, in these circumstances and where the pattern of shipping and personnel are continuously changing, the Inspectorate must be constantly alert to enforce compliance with the Regulations and minimise adverse public criticism. A great deal of work has been done to achieve the present satisfactory result and much is yet to be done to maintain this achievement and promote further progress. Short of legal proceedings, the policy of education and persuasion should and will be continued to this end. Officially recorded action during the year included *Prosecution 1 * *Statutory Notices served 3 ***Informal Notices and Warnings 32 * Case dismissed. ** Cautionary letter sent. *** No recurrence of offence after notification by Inspector. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936, PART X-CANAL BOATS Ten inspections of canal boats were made during the year. Three canal boats were found to have a total of four defects, as follows Cabin in need of cleaning and/or painting 1 Boat required painting inside and out 1 Defective and holed condition of cabin sides 1 Required general overhaul for minor delapidations 1 4 The Owners and Master of the defective craft were in each case notified and required to carry out the necessary repairs. The following infringements of the Act were also found Certificate of Registration not produced 2 Certificate of Registration requiring renewal 2 4 The Owners and Masters were informed of the requirements of the Act in these respects. The return of the number of inspections of canal boats made during the year is a clear indication that this traffic is now virtually non-existent so far as the Regents Canal is concerned. A report of the British Waterways Board stated that from 1954-62 the tonnage of goods fell by 8%, and that while costs increased 34% receipts rose by only 22%. That this unhealthy state of affairs could not be allowed to continue is reflected in their adoption of a "multi-user" policy, 20 which in their view, with a broader operational basis, economic or social, offers the best future for Inland Waterways. The appearance of converted narrow boats used as pleasure craft on some of the more rural canals is one aspect of this new policy. A matter, however, of closer interest to the Port Health Authority as well as to the Metropolis, is the scheme a private group of canal carriers, who under licence operate the Grand Union and Regents Canals, have formulated and which has been submitted to the Rochdale Committee. It is based on utilising the inland waterways through London, including of course the River Thames, for the conveyance of goods to and from specially set up water-side terminals on the outskirts of this now greatly extended conurbation, where goods will be off and on loaded from vehicular traffic to lighters or canal craft. It is intended that a link should be made with the London Docks from such terminal depots for the purpose of dealing with imports and exports. If the scheme was fully implemented, it would undoubtedly result in a reduction of the number of heavy vehicles needing to pass through the Metropolis to the Docks. On account of the immense congestion they cause in the central area, the Police have already sought and obtained powers to restrict these heavy vehicles to one particular route. Although the primary object of the scheme is to relieve traffic congestion by providing an alternative means of transport, there would as a result also be a decrease in the amount of atmospheric pollution as well as a diminution in the volume of noise which would ensue as a natural consequence of this. These are matters equally important from a public health point of view. As was stated at a Conference of the National Society for Clean Air, it has been estimated that half the pollution in some American Cities came from motor vehicles, and this may well be the case in some of our own Cities. The scheme is, therefore, one which must appeal to all London local authorities who have prescribed "smokeless areas", and on that account as well as from the traffic point of view should be given proper consideration. LOADING AND TRANSPORT OF REFUSE BY LIGHTERS Regular inspection of the wharves and lighters continued during the year and several minor infringements were dealt with without recourse to legal action. On one occasion only, it was decided to take legal proceedings which were successful and a penalty was imposed. There are sixteen wharves in regular service on the tideway and in the creeks and an additional six wharves are maintained for any emergency tipping. Two refuse depots outside the jurisdiction of the Port Health Authority continued to transport the refuse by lighters to disposal points within the district of the Port Health Authority. The operations of loading, carriage and discharge of refuse are watched by the Inspectors afloat to ensure that the provisions of the Byelaws are complied with. There was a slight, general improvement noted although much more is desired, especially at the open wharves with direct tipping of buoyant refuse exposed to the elements. Covering of loaded lighters in transit showed some improvement. During the early part of the year, Lots Road Power Station at Chelsea commenced disposal of furnace clinker by lighter as a temporary measure to cope with a modernisation programme. Hitherto, this clinker had been transported by road vehicles. The method of loading was to convey it by a water-carriage system from the boiler house to a storage pond, and thence to the lighter by a perforated grab, operated by a tracked diesel unit. By virtue of its heavy gravity, only a fraction of the normal bulk is carried by a fully laden lighter and, the clinker being free from dust, it is not found necessary to cover the coamings with tarpaulins to comply with the Byelaws. The cargo is entirely inert and innocuous. Another improvement was successfully effected by Fulham Borough Council at the Townmead Road Depot where the new refuse disposal installation operates on the principle of sorting, salvage and incineration. The clinker residue from the furnace is wetted and transferred from the plant to the wharf frontage by a covered conveyor belt, through a telescopic chute from which it cascades into the lighter. No tarpaulin sheeting of the coaming is enforced or necessary. It may well by that other improvements will accrue when the Greater London Council takes control and schemes at present witheld proceed from the drawing board stage. HOUSEBOATS The Essex County Council Act, 1952, provides that the mooring of any houseboat within the County shall not be lawful without the consent of the Council of the district in which the houseboat is situated, and that the Council may require the owner or occupier to remove or demolish any houseboat not authorised by them. The Port and City of London Health Committee are, however, still responsible under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, for the sanitary supervision of houseboats coming within the jurisdiction of the Port Health Authority, although under the Essex County Council Act, 1952, the local Council in Essex are now responsible for the licensing and drawing up of conditions under which they are prepared to grant licences to houseboats. 21 The duties of the Committee in regard to the sanitary supervision of houseboats are safeguarded by Section 212 of the Essex County Council Act, 1952, which provides inter alia that no consent shall be given to the mooring of any houseboat within the Port of London without the previous written consent of the Corporation of London as the Port Health Authority of the Port of London. Ben fleet During the year, the Benfleet Urban District Council, with the concurrence of the Port Health Authority, granted nineteen 'temporary consents' to boats which were considered fit for human habitation for the ensuing twelve months. This was three fewer than the previous year. Although the consent allows for permanent habitation, many of the houseboats are seldom occupied. There are always problems of refuse and sewage disposal and provision of drinking water supplies for these craft and it is anticipated that the number will gradually diminish especially in view of the immediate proximity of a Council refuse tip. Canvey Island Ten years ago, there were twenty houseboats in this area, but some were either destroyed or sevetely damaged in the floods of 1953, while others were displaced to allow for work to be done in the Creek to prevent a recurrence of the disaster. There remain only six boats which lie at the seaward end of Smallgains Creek and only one of which is permanently occupied. Canvey Island Urban District Council have never granted 'temporary consents' and, although the sewage and drinking water problems are present, the colony has never given rise to anxiety in a general way. DANGEROUS DRUGS During the year twenty-six certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued under the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1953, Regulation 13 (2) of which is as follows (a) The master of a foreign ship which is in a port in Great Britain shall be authorised to procure such quantity of drugs and preparations as may be certified by the medical officer of health of the port health authority within whose jurisdiction the ship is or, in his absence, by the assistant medical officer of health, to be necessary for the equipment of the ship until it reaches its home port. (b) A person who supplies a drug or preparation in accordance with a certificate given under this paragraph shall retain the certificate and mark it with the date on which the drug or preparation was supplied and keep it on his premises so as to be at all times available for inspection. PIGEON CONTROL There has been no change in the methods of control during the year, nor has there been any serious complaint about nuisances arising from fouling or damage by pigeons within the Docks. Since the responsibility must rest with the owners and/or occupiers of the premises and the Port Health Authority to safeguard public health, the co-operation of all three is essential and is obtained. The Port of London Authority engage a private contractor with a license to narcoticise the birds with approved baits and subsequently destroy them humanely, while the tenants of industrial premises regularly trap birds and destroy eggs at the localised roosting haunts. The operations of the contractor are carried out when the docks are not working and the area is quiet, and although they are not necessarily witnessed by the Port Health Authority, the recorded results are made available to the Inspectors. The systematic trapping of birds and egg destruction however is kept under regular surveillance. Since the introduction of The Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers, etc.) Regulations, 1960, particular attention has been paid to the meat transport premises and granaries. Number of birds trapped 1,049 Number of eggs destroyed 402 Number of birds narcoticised 10,557 \MM\L HEALTH AND WELFARE At 6 p.m. on 13th May, the Boarding Medical Officer received a message via North Foreland Radio Station from the Russian ship "Angaresk" due in Gravesend Reach later that evening that a reindeer aboard was parturient. Not being able to communicate directly with the ship, which was not fitted with VHF radio, North Foreland Radio Station kindly made contact by Morse telegraphy in order to determine the ship's requirements. The answer came just as the ship was approaching Gravesend Reach that the Company's Agents had arranged for a Veterinary Surgeon to attend. The Boarding Medical Officer was greatly relieved to know that he would not have to act as midwife to a reindeer, a job for which he felt he was inadequately trained. â€¢Â» THE PROVISION OF SANITARY ACCOMMODATION AT THE DOCKS Permanent Accommodation As a matter of urgency provision of up-to-date and adequate sanitary conveniences has been the continued concern of the Port of London Authority and the Port Health Authority. A programme giving priority according to demand has been arranged which includes schemes of reconstruction and additional construction to augment existing provisions which may be inadequate. Location is a very important factor, particularly to resident crews of ships obliged to use the conveniences and similarly to the dockworkers employed at the berths. The new conveniences are comprehensive in design and provide separate accommodation for ladies, officers, shore staff, crew and dock employees. Those sited at berths normally occupied by ships with Asian crews are specifically provided with a section which meets the personal customs of Asians. In addition to providing conveniences it is necessary to arrange for their maintenance which must include supervised daily cleansing. At present this work is carried out by a servicing contractor, but difficulties have been met with toilets that have been misused. Such incidents are unfortunately frequent and there would appear to be no remedy short of the employment of regular attendants which would be considered financially prohibitive since the conveniences are in service by night and day. The Port Health Staff systematically inspect for cleanliness and efficiency of the installations to expedite corrective action where nuisances are discovered. Hooliganism, leading to wanton destruction of sanitary fittings, often occurs after normal dock working hours and is becoming a matter of concern to the P.L.A. Dock Police. The reconstruction programme has been extended to conform with the requirements of the Food Hygiene (Docks Carriers) Regulations, 1960 and in this respect has been almost completed. To this end, the allocation of sanitary accommodation has been met by some conversions as well as some new construction at the meat discharging berths. Units in service comprise twin urinal stalls and 4 feet washing troughs, situated at the following berths Royal Victoria Dock 'A', 'F, and 'Z' sheds. Royal Albert Dock No. 10-12, No. 12-14, No. 29, No. 33 sheds King George V Dock No. 5, No. 4-6, No. 6-8, sheds. Although soap dispensers and electrically operated hand driers are provided at some of the units where conversions have been carried out, this problem remains to be solved generally and is a subject for further consideration. MOBILE AND TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION In order to meet the needs of the large number of passengers who disembark and may be detained for some time ashore by landing formalities, suitable sanitary units are moved into the area as necessary For the convenience of those who find it expedient to use lavatories aboard ship rather than those ashore at the berths arrangements can be made on request for them to have portable chemical closets, serviced by a contractor. This is a particularly useful provision in wintry weather for wives or families on visit, especially of a ship happens not to be moored alongside. NEW LAUNCH TO REPLACE M.L. "ALFRED ROBERTSON" After twenty-six years of continuous service the launch "Alfred Robertson" no longer has the speed and amenities for present day requirements of the port health service. It has therefore been decided to replace her by a slightly larger vessel, increasing the overall length by 4 ft. 6 ins., the beam by 2ft. and the moulded depth by 6 ins. Thus the dimensions of the new vessel will be Length overall 58 ft. 6 ins. Breadth moulded 14 ft. 0 ins. Depth moulded 7 ft. 0 ins. Draft aft 5 ft. 3 ins. The new launch will be of steel construction, with a single screw driven by a Gardner diesel engine developing 230 b.h.p. to give the desired operational speed of 10 knots. The General Arrangement plan shows the cruiser stern and forward flare and sheer, which are designed to help keep the decks reasonably dry in adverse weather when underway. Although primarily for the Middle River District service, this new vessel will be able to relieve "Humphrey Morris' on Gravesend Boarding Station in cases of emergency, and will be built under the Survey of Lloyds Register of Shipping with equipment in accordance with the latest requirements of the Ministry of Transport. 23 24 GENERAL ARRANGEMENT - NEW LAUNCH VISITORS AND STUDENTS Visitors and students, usually medical men and public health inspectors have continued to come from overseas for theoretical and practical instruction in and demonstration of Port Health work. They receive instruction in as many aspects as time permits and this may range from days to weeks, or even months. During the year visitors came from Arabia, Borneo, Ceylon, Chile, Hong-Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaya, Mauritius, Nigeria, Poland, Sierra-Leone, Tanganyika, Thailand, Turkey, West Indies, and Yugo-Slavia. Although this work must inevitably add considerably to the normal duties of the Inspectorate and Rodent Operatives, it is accepted that port health work is both national and international in character and its effectiveness must depend to some degree upon the efficiency of the controls applied throughout the ports of the world. Students taking the Diploma examination for Public Health Inspectors are required to be given training in port health work and this instruction has been undertaken on behalf of many authorities in the London area. Some students have already been given the necessary instructions and it is anticipated that many more will come forward in the future. FOOD HYGIENE (DOCK CARRIERS, ETC.) REGULATIONS, 1960 During the year every effort was made to secure compliance with the Regulations so far as was considered reasonably practicable, but it must be acknowledged that the meat berths in the docks and the generally accepted methods of handling meat cargoes are not condusive to hygienic conditions. To a great extent, this has made the task of raising the standard of hygienic handling both slow and very often difficult. Whilst it is agreed that more hygienic conditions should be introduced the cost of carrying out the complete capital works involved and providing the necessary equipment immediately is considered to be prohibitive. However, it is gratifying to find that the required improvements are being introduced gradually and cleaner practices generally accepted. There has been an appreciable improvement in the conditions of road vehicles. The older types of vehicles and trailers with wooden linings have been progressively converted or replaced by those which are internally sheathed with suitable metal or plastic insulation, and increased use has been made of the larger refrigerated bulk transports. As regards rail transport, credit is due to the Port of London Authority for the considerable improvement in their trucks which have all been metal sheathed. There is also an increasing tendency towards the use of portable insulated containers, which can be easily cleansed. In addition to the provision of suitable trucks and containers, however a proper organisation for their cleaning must be established so that the incoming rolling stock may arrive at the loading points in a proper condition for loading meat. To this end, consistent pressure has been applied but the desired results are not readily forthcoming. It is anticipated that the provisional plan to establish a marshalling yard with adequate means for cleansing of the rolling stock will be implemented. The practice of wearing protective clothing by the men engaged at the meat berths has become firmly established. Those who handle the chilled beef wear washable caps and capes, while those employed at the landing tables for frozen meat with stockinette covering are provided with suitable aprons. A 'code of practice' has been generally accepted to ensure that the quays and precincts thereof are in a clean condition before and during the period of meat discharge from the ships and loading into the transports. Hosing of the quays is a feature of this code. Latrines and washing facilities have been carefully considered and reasonable provision has been made at the selected berths, but not always to the extent required by the Regulations. Persistent efforts are made by the Inspectorate to inculcate the need for proper facilities and hygienic practices. THE FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960-1962 The annual survey of passenger-carrying launches which operate the summer services on the River was carried out as usual during the early part of the year. It has become accepted practice during this period of re-fitting to thoroughly cleanse and chlorinate the fresh water storage tanks as well as the piped installation in preparation for the summer season operations. Although these launches generally comply with the appropriate requirements of the Regulations, there remained certain desirable features which, when brought to the notice of the Owners, have received consideration and modifications have been made within reasonable financial limits. There had been a steady trend to make improvements both in 25 struction and equipment. Obsolete hand-washing basins are being replaced by properly fitted traditional fixed basins in moulded plaster. Several of the bars have been modernised and in one instance the working space behind the bar has been increased to promote a higher standard of hygiene while another of the larger vessels has been considerably modernised. Sanitary accommodation is a major issue in the Regulations which, inter alia, require that every sanitary convenience shall be so placed that no offensive odours therefrom can penetrate into any food room. There are, however, some launches on which the sanitary accommodation is inside the saloon and the bar is an integral part of the saloon. Any attempt to isolate the sanitary accommodation by building additional structures has been frowned upon by the Ministry of Transport which is seriously concerned with the emergency evacuation of passengers at short notice. In order to overcome the difficulty, the idea has gained favour to move the sanitary accommodation from the lower deck to the upper deck and set it into the superstructure when carrying out modernisation and refitting. This has been effected in two launches already and is in the process in another. The three large vessels engaged on excursions to coastal resorts and to the Continent have been re-fitted generally to a standard in excess of the minimum requirements of the Regulations. The problem of adequate fresh water storage to meet peak demands however remains a major obstacle since the vessels were not designed to meet the requirements of the Regulations. Therefore, the Exemption Certificates which were granted by this Authority some three years ago will remain valid. During the year, 47 inspections were made to ensure compliance with the Regulations and food hygiene practice in general. Only a few minor infringements were observed and promptly corrected. It is expected that the steady improvement achieved this year will be continued and the modern amenities increasingly demanded by the public will soon be provided. One 'Hovercraft' and two 'Hydrofoils' made an appearance during the summer in King's Reach and the Upper Pool for commercial reasons. To what extent they may become passenger-carrying transports remains to be known. FOOD INSPECTION The total amount of foodstuffs detained for examination and either condemned as unfit for human consumption and destroyed or otherwise disposed of under guarantee and supervision was 6,614 tons 10 cwts. 2 qrs. 22 lbs.

MEAT INSPECTION During 1963 a total of 371 vessels whose principle cargo was refrigerated meats discharged in the Royal Docks. There was no change in the adopted policy or the methods of control exercised in the docks to ensure that imported meats complied with Public Health legislation designed to protect the public from diseased or unsound meat and to enforce hygienic handling during unloading and transportation. As in previous years, inspection for soundness and freedom from disease involved physical examination at the unloading berths and in the meat examination centre while bacteriological examinations were carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service at Colindale. To ensure hygienic standards of meat handling at the docks required daily supervision and consultation with port officials in conjunction with a steady pressure at all levels to educate those closely concerned with the actual handling of partially protected meats. Physical Examination All imported meats for sale for human consumption are required to bear a certificate showing that (a) The meat to which it relates or the meat from which the meat product has been prepared, was derived from animals inspected ante and post mortem and passed in accordance with criteria satisfactory to the Minister, and (b) That all necessary precautions for the prevention of danger to public health were taken in the dressing or preparing and packing of the meat or meat product. To thaw and examine in detail specimens of imported meats and offals, even though they had already passed an inspection procedure and had been certificated, proved to be a necessary control measure. This work is carried out continuously and has revealed failure of the inspection procedure in varying degrees in all the major meat exporting countries.Notification of unsatisfactory 28 The following table gives the number of items examined:- Commodity Argentine Australia New Zealandal U.S.A. Uruguay Yugoslavia Brazil Total Ox & beef livers 4,070 130 30 30 4,260 Sheep & lambs 200 300 1,300 300 2,100 Boneless beef 5 15 10 10 40 Boneless mutton & lamb 32 5 224 10 5 276 Various offals 15 30 15 10 70 Rabbits 30 30 Apart from the discovery of disease or dirty dressing, the thawing and examination also reveals by the presence or absence of incisions or the method of incision to what extent meat inspection has been carried out in the country of origin. Bacteriological Sampling The drawing of samples and the administration entailed in the detention of considerable quantities of meat from the different meat exporting countries has occupied a great deal of the Inspectors' time. It is clearly established that the production of boneless meat for human consumption involves a much greater risk of initial contamination during the operation of cutting and boning and this may give rise to a public health hazard by spreading food poisoning organisms when the meats are used in the preparation of various meat products. The Port of London has continued to deal realistically with this problem and the allied problem of contaminated meats intended for the pets food trade. Meat samples drawn for bacteriological examination numbered 3,782, as follows Total Samples Drawn Positive for Salmonellae percentage Boneless beef 1676 17.6 Horse meat 1727 33.6 Boneless mutton 123 10.6 Rabbits 86 5.8 Boneless veal 170 1.8 Examination Facilities Physical examination and bacteriological sampling on such a large scale has strained the resources available and, often, the size of the examination centre at No. 6 Cold Store has been found inadequate, the volume of work being such that the floor space imposed a limit on the output which, otherwise, should be limited only by the needs of the Authority's policy and the availability of Inspectors to carry it out. Unsound Meat Investigation A major investigation was carried out by the Meat Inspectors into the movement of 11,000 cartons of imported veal which previously had been found unfit for human consumption, but were later traded into human consumption channels. This investigation involved tracing every carton to its destination and ultimate owner. The co-operation of other local authorities was sought and was, of course, willingly given. Suitable warnings were issued to every Authority into whose district the meat had been delivered or was used and, although several months passed in this time consuming search, the outcome fully justified the effort. The City of London Police collaborated throughout this investigation and particular appreciation is due to them for their assistance. FOOD SAMPLING Inspectors During the year 1712 samples of tea were examined on the dock and approved. 29 results and subsequent detention of similar consignments has usually resulted in a marked improvement.
