The Board submit herewith:— A statement of their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1885, and of their Assets and Liabilities on that day, with detailed particulars and summary statements of the same. A statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1882-3, 1883-4, and 1884-5. A table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1885. A statement of the contracts entered into by the Board during the year ended 25th March, 1885. The Board also submit the Report of their Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended 31st December, 1884, containing particulars of the population, rate of mortality, and other statistics relating to the general health of the District; and the Report of the Board's Surveyor for the year ended Lady-day, 1885, in which will be found the particulars of the works carried out under his supervision. During the year the Board have paid the sum of £5,433 16s. 8d. in reduction of the mortgages owing by them. They have also raised during the same period the sum of £2,150 for new permanent works and improvements in the District. The Board are glad to report that the Loans which in past years were raised at 5 per cent, interest have now all been paid off, with the exception of two which have but two more years to run. The balances in respect of two mortgages have been paid off and discharged during the year, viz., one, No. 10, for £4,000, raised in 1864 at £5 per cent, per annum, and 6 one, No. 44, for £575, raised in 1877 at 4| per cent, per annum. The new Loans have, as stated in previous Reports, been obtained at the rate of 3½ per cent. THE BOARD’S HOSPITAL. This Establishment—for the isolation of infectious diseases—has been maintained throughout the year in a thorough state of efficiency, although, again owing to the healthy state of the district, but few cases have occurred needing isolation. No deaths have taken place in the Hospital during the year. NEW STREETS AND SEWERS. The various works projected and carried out by the Board under this head will, as in previous years, be found specified in the Surveyor's Report. FIRE PLUG INDICATORS. As stated in previous Reports these indicators are marked upon the gas lamps to indicate the position of the various fire-plugs in the district. The Board again refer to them in this year's Report, feeling assured that this information cannot be too frequently brought before the public. STREET NAMING, &c. During the year the following Orders have been made by the Metropolitan Board, altering Street names and numbers, and have been duly carried out by this Board:— An Order for re-numbering the houses in Crampton Road, Penge. ,, for the like in Thicket Road, Penge. „ for the like in part of Hither Green Lane, Lewisham. „ for re-naming Stoney Lane, Catford, "Blythe Vale, S.E.," and for re-numbering the houses therein. 7 SANITARY. The Sanitary condition of the district continues highly satisfactory. The Board append the Report of the Medical Officer for the year ended 31st December last, from which it will be seen that the annual rate of mortality in the District was 1392 per 1000, whilst the annual rate of the whole of London for the like period amounted to 20.3 per 1000, and of Districts outside London 17.5. The number of inhabited houses and the population of the district also continue to increase, as shewn by the Table in the Medical Officer's Report annexed. The number in each case, at Midsummer, 1884, being— Inhabited houses 12,716 Estimated population 79,730 The Return (Table VI.), shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Committees, and the proceedings taken thereon. The Slaughter-houses, Cowhouses, and Fishmongers' premises, have been periodically inspected by the Board's Sanitary Officers. Under this head the Board wish again to mention a sanitary matter to which considerable time and attention is devoted by the Board's Committees and their Officers, as being a matter of great importance to the health of a growing community, viz, the collection and removal of Dust, &c. The cost of this work exceeds £2,000 per annum, and as the price obtained by the Board for the refuse is declining this cost must grow, but every effort is made, without unduly increasing the expenditure, to keep the district as clear from dust as possible. The Board again urgently request all householders to see that the men are not refused the dust on calling, and that any vegetable, animal, or other matter, which may be burnt or otherwise destroyed, is not placed in the ashpits. Any complaints of the non-clearance of ashpits may be made by letter to the Board, at their Offices, when attention will be given to the same; but it is apparent that the Board 8 cannot collect the dust more frequently than at present without incurring a much heavier outlay. BAKEHOUSES. The inspection and control of Bakehouses has again been placed in the hands of the Local Authorities. The Board feeling the necessity for such inspection and control, pressed upon the higher authorities the importance of allowing it to revert to the Local Governing Bodies, and this result the Board are glad to say, has been attained. By the 17th sec. of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, it is provided: " As respects every retail bakehouse, the provisions of the Act, and of sects. 3, 33, 34, and 35 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, which relate to cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and other sanitary conditions, should be enforced by the local authority of the district in which the bakehouse is situate, and not by an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, and that for the purpose of such section it was enacted that the Medical Officer of Health should have and exercise all such powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings and otherwise, as an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878." RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable Value of the District at the end of the year 1884, was— Lewisham £417,367 Penge 161,864 Total £579,231 Showing an increase on the amounts mentioned in the last Report of— Lewisham £14,488 Penge 304 Total increase £14,792 9 EXPENDITURE. Inasmuch as this Board has to collect and pay over to the different Metropolitan Boards very considerable sums in the course of the year, it may be well to note that the actual amount required by this Board during the year under review for its own purposes, from the Guardians of the Poor of Lewisham, was only the sum of £34,092, being equivalent to a rate, on the Rateable Value in force at the commencement of the year, of a fraction over 1s. 8d. in the pound, while the rates levied for the same period for all purposes in the Parish of Lewisham amounted to 5s. 4d. in the pound. The amount so required from the Overseers of the Hamlet of Penge was £9,995, being equivalent to a rate of a fraction under 1s. 3d. in the pound, out of an amount of 5s. 3d. in the pound levied in the Hamlet. The amounts which the Board raised for Metropolitan bodies, and paid over to them, were:—For the Metropolitan Board, £15,464 15s. 3d.; forthe School Board, £19,071 13s. 5d. The Metropolitan Board's Precept for the year ending 31st December, 1885, and embracing a portion of the year now under review, is £2,448 in excess of the sum thus required; and that of the London School Board for the same period is £2,070 in excess of the amount raised for their purposes in the past year. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. Notwithstanding the facilities offered, enabling the ratepayers to avail themselves of these Acts for the detection of adulteration of food, milk, &c., very few have taken advantage thereof. Full particulars of these facilities, as given in a public notice issued by the Board, are set out in previous Reports; and for convenience the Board again repeat the same:— The Notice referred to. "The attention of the Board having been called to the desirability of giving greater facilities than at present exist to the general public in aid of the working of 'The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts', they have now made arrangements with the Public 10 Analyst of the District, Mr. C. Heisch, of 79, Mark Lane, E.C., whereby samples and articles desired by any resident in the District to be analysed may be left with the Secretary of the Board during office hours, at their Offices, and no further trouble in the matter need then fall on such resident, as, in the event of such sample proving upon analysis to be adulterated, the resident is not compelled to prosecute the seller. A fee of 2s. 6d., which must be paid at once, will be charged for each sample brought by a resident for analysis, the balance of the analyst's fee of 10s. 6d. will be paid by the Board. "Care should be taken that the samples brought for analysis are in the same condition as when bought. The name and address of the seller must be supplied, and the buyer must sign the proper form, which will be prepared at the Board's Offices. All samples received for analysis are accepted in strict confidence, and the result will be communicated to the buyer direct by post. "The only expense to the buyer is the payment of the beforementioned fee of 2s. 6d. "If residents within the District have reasonable grounds for suspecting any seller of adulterating, they may write to the Board, giving the name and address of the seller and the article suspected and enclosing a double fee of 5s., when the Board will direct their Inspectors of Nuisances to take the necessary steps for obtaining an analysis without further reference or expense to the resident; and if the article is found to be adulterated further steps will be taken by the Board. Such communications will also be received in strict confidence. No notice can be taken of anonymous communications, although the fee may be enclosed." PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. In November the Board received notice of the following Schemes proposed to be introduced into Parliament, viz.:— 1. The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Bill. 2. The Beckenham, South Norwood-park and Crystal Palace Railways Bill. 3. The Crystal Palace, South Eastern and Metropolitan Railway Bill. 4. The South Eastern Railway (Various Powers) Bill. 5. The London, Chatham, and Dover Railway (Further Powers) Bill. G. The Crystal Palace, Anerley, and Gipsy-hill Tramways Bill. Of these Schemes one only, viz., the South Eastern Railway 11 (Various Powers) Bill, passed the Houses of Parliament and received the Royal Assent. The Board, after careful consideration and after receiving Memorials from Ratepayers upon the subject, determined to oppose the Bill of the South Eastern Railway Company, unless the Company would agree to increase the width of the proposed new bridges in the District, and also would, in constructing the proposed widenings, so reconstruct the bridges in Loampit Vale and High Street, Lewisham, as to deaden the noise caused by trains passing over them, which noise had in the past caused frequent accidents; and would also agree to erect a station on their main line at or near High Street, Lewisham. Station accommodation on the Main Line had long been demanded by the public, and the Board were strongly urged by public meetings and otherwise to insist upon this being provided. The Company refused to entertain any proposal with regard to these improvements, and the Board had, consequently, to petition against the Bill and oppose the same before a Committee of the House of Commons, when, after a lengthened struggle, clauses were inserted in the Bill compelling the Company to considerably widen the bridges before referred to, in some cases to double them; also compelling them, in all new bridges, to make them water-tight and noiseless, as far as possible, and in addition, a Parliamentary undertaking was given by the Counsel for the Railway Company that a station should be erected on their main line so soon as the widenings should be opened, somewhere between the High Street, Lewisham, and the fork of the Railway near Hither Green Lane. The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Bill was proceeded with to a considerable extent, and substituted plans were lodged with the Board, which considerably reduced the opposition of the Board to the scheme, but the Bill was ultimately thrown out of the House of Commons without the same being referred to a select Committee. 12 The other Bills referred to were also dropped by the promoters before proceeding to Committee. REPRESENTATION AT METROPOLITAN BOARD. At a Meeting of the joint Boards of Plumstead and Lewisham, held on the 26th of March, 1884, Mr. Edwin Hughes, a Member of the Plumstead Board, was elected the Representative of the joint Boards at the Metropolitan Board of Works, in the place of Mr. J. R. Lloyd, deceased—there were 37 Members of the Plumstead Board and 26 Members of the Lewisham Board present at the Meeting. Mr. Edwin Hughes was nominated on behalf of the Plumstead Board, and Mr. Theo. W. Williams was nominated on behalf of this Board. Upon a show of hands there appeared for Mr. Hughes 37 and for Mr. Williams 26, and Mr. Hughes was therefore elected as above stated. As far back as the year 1883, the Board requested the Works and General Purposes Committee to prepare a Memorial to be laid before the Metropolitan Board of Works, setting forth the urgent reasons that existed in favour of this Board having a separate representative at the Metropolitan Board, and requesting that Board to adopt the necessary measures to carry out this Board's wish into effect. To the present time this Board has been joined with the Plumstead Board of Works in electing a Member to the Metropolitan Board, and fur the past fourteen years a Member of the Plumstead Board of Works has been elected to fill this office, and inasmuch as the Members of the Plumstead Board number 37, and the Members of this Board only 27, it is apparent that it is always in the power of the Plumstead Board to elect one of their own body as the Representative, and that, therefore, for all practical purposes, the Lewisham Board is unrepresented at the Metropolitan Board. This state of affairs has long been considered by this Board as unsatisfactory and unjust, as the interests of the Lewisham Board are larger than those of the Plumstead Board, the population of the Lewisham District, according to the Census of 1881, amounting to about 72,000, or 8,000 in 13 excess of the Plumstead District, the rateable value of the District at 1884 being £564,439, or £238,867 in excess of the Plumstead District. On the 9th November, 1883, the Memorial was presented by this Board to the Metropolitan Board of Works. A Memorial was also presented by the Plumstead Board of Works, both asking the Metropolitan Board to take the necessary steps for procuring power from Parliament to remedy the evil complained of by the joint Boards, and giving to each Board the right of electing a separate ADDENDUM. "The Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885," referred to on page 13, received the Royal Assent on the 31st July, 1885, and on the 23rd September following Mr. Theo. W. Williams, was elected the first representative of the Board thereunder. and their support promised. Subsequently Viscount Lewisham, M.P., promised to take charge of the Bill in question, and such Bill was accordingly read a first time on the 24th April last, the Bill being backed by Sir Charles Mills, Sir Trevor Lawrence, Mr. James Stuart, Mr. Grantham, and Mr. Boord. This Bill was subsequently largely amended in Committee, by increasing the number of new Representatives at the Metropolitan Board of Works from six to thirteen. These amendments were accepted by Viscount Lewisham, and the Bill duly passed on the 6th July, and before this Report was printed had received the Royal assent. 12 The other Bills referred to were also dropped by the promoters before proceeding to Committee. REPRESENTATION AT METROPOLITAN BOARD. At a Meeting of the joint Boards of Plumstead and Lewisham, held on the 26th of March, 1884, Mr. Edwin Hughes, a Member of the Plumstead Board, was elected the Representative of the joint Boards at the Metropolitan Board of Works, in the place of Mr. J. R. Lloyd, deceased—there were 37 Members of the Plumstead Board and 26 Members office, and inasmuch as the Members of the Plumstead Board number 37, and the Members of this Board only 27, it is apparent that it is always in the power of the Plumstead Board to elect one of their own body as the Representative, and that, therefore, for all practical purposes, the Lewisham Board is unrepresented at the Metropolitan Board. This state of affairs has long been considered by this Board as unsatisfactory and unjust, as the interests of the Lewisham Board are larger than those of the Plumstead Board, the population of the Lewisham District, according to the Census of 1881, amounting to about 72,000, or 8,000 in 13 excess of the Plumstead District, the rateable value of the District at 1884 being £564,439, or £238,867 in excess of the Plumstead District. On the 9th November, 1883, the Memorial was presented by this Board to the Metropolitan Board of Works. A Memorial was also presented by the Plumstead Board of Works, both asking the Metropolitan Board to take the necessary steps for procuring power from Parliament to remedy the evil complained of by the joint Boards, and giving to each Board the right of electing a separate Representative. These Memorials were referred to the Works and General Purposes Committee of the Metropolitan Board, and after long delay the only answer that could be obtained by this Board was that, in the face of the London Government Bill, introduced into Parliament by the Government, they did not feel that any measure introduced by them upon the subject would have any chance of success. Mr. Hughes then proposed to this Board that he should prepare a short Bill with the object of giving separate representation to this Board and the Plumstead Board, and also giving increased representation to some of the other Vestries and Boards of London who had applied for the same, and this Board at once adopted such suggestion. The Bill was prepared, and the several Members of Parliament representing the several Districts interested in such Bill, met at the House of Commons, and received a deputation of gentlemen upon the subject, when the Bill was explained to them and their support promised. Subsequently Viscount Lewisham, M.P., promised to take charge of the Bill in question, and such Bill was accordingly read a first time on the 24th April last, the Bill being backed by Sir Charles Mills, Sir Trevor Lawrence, Mr. James Stuart, Mr. Grantham, and Mr. Boord. This Bill was subsequently largely amended in Committee, by increasing the number of new Representatives at the Metropolitan Board of Works from six to thirteen. These amendments were accepted by Viscount Lewisham, and the Bill duly passed on the 6th July, and before this Report was printed had received the Royal assent. 14 DEPUTATIONS. During the year the Board have appointed Members to attend several deputations and conferences called for the discussion of different questions affecting the general wellbeing of the Metropolis. MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT. The Board had under its consideration throughout the year the Bill introduced into Parliament by the Government for the better government of London, and on the 30th April last the following Motion was carried by the Board:— "That the Lewisham Board of Works has seen with satisfaction the introduction into Parliament of the London Municipal Bill, and that, inasmuch as the measure contains the principle of Local Councils popularly elected, having entrusted to them the management of local affairs, combined with a much more efficient representation than hitherto of each District in the central and controlling Council, the Board gives a hearty general approval to the Bill, but trusts the main duties of the District Councils will be stated in the Bill itself, and that entire control over their officers be vested in them as heretofore." This Bill was, however, subsequently withdrawn. PARLIAMENTARY BOROUGH OF LEWISHAM. The Board gave great consideration to the proposal by the Government to constitute a Parliamentary Borough of Lewisham, under the Redistribution of Seats Bill. This Bill proposed that such Parliamentary Borough should consist of the whole of the District of the Lewisham Board of Works, with the Parish of Lee added thereto, but subsequently the Hamlet of Penge made strong efforts to be separated from the Borough of Lewisham and placed in Camberwell, on the ground that the Borough of Lewisham was in Kent, and the Hamlet was in Surrey, and as the population of the proposed Borough was much above the average, amounting to 84,000, such efforts were ultimately successful, although this Board felt bound to oppose them. This Board also endeavoured to obtain the Reekcnham Sewerage Area to be included in the 15 proposed Parliamentary Borough, as the Beckenham tongue of land is thus commonly called, separating the District like a wedge, and it was felt that great difficulty would he experienced by the ratepayers in ascertaining in which Parliamentary Borough they were situate, but as such Sewerage Area was not within the boundary of the Metropolis such application failed. ROAD WATERING SUPPLY. The Board have pleasure in announcing that a very considerable reduction in the price of the water supplied for watering the roads in the District has been effected, both from the Kent Water Works Company and the Lambeth Water Company, the amount of such reduction being on an average 25 per cent. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS AND OCCUPIED BY MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. During the year the Board have adopted Regulations under the provisions of the 35th sec. of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and these Regulations have been confirmed by the Local Government Board* Such Regulations are printed and can be seen at the Board's offices. The same apply to all houses let in lodgings, with the following exceptions:— (a) Where for the purpose of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than Gs. per week: (b) Where for the purpose of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house cxceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 7s, 6d. per week. 16 AUDIENCES OF THE BOARD. The following amended Bye laws were made and confirmed by the Board on the 13th February, 1884:— " Interviews. "I. A personal interview shall not be granted by the Board to any person or number of persons at any Meeting of the Board unless a written application be made at least 48 hours before the time of Meeting, stating the object of the interview; and the same, if granted, shall take place at a quarter after Five o'clock in the afternoon, or at such other time as the Board may from time to time appoint. "II. That upon any such interview being so granted to any person or number of persons, or to a deputation, such person or persons, or deputation, shall be required to be introduced by a Member of the Board, and one person only of any such number of persons or deputation attending shall be allowed to address the Board upon the subject of the interview, and thereupon the same shall be referred to a Committee, or be otherwise dealt with as may be deemed expedient." THE ANNUAL INSPECTION. It has been the custom of the Board for many years to make an Annual Inspection of the District. As will be remembered the District consists of the Parish of Lewisham, divided into three Wards, returning in all 21 Members, and of the Hamlet of Penge returning 6 Members; and it may be imagined that the Members thus returned in many instances are not well acquainted with the other parts of the District, therefore it has been found of the utmost use that each Member should, at least once a year, visit the different parts of this widely-extended District, and be able to inspect the various works in progress or in contemplation; they are then in a position to bring personal knowledge to aid them in the discussion of the necessity or otherwise of the proposed Works.

Catford, s.e., 16tli May, 1885. REPORT to The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1884, by F. EACHUS WILKINSON, M.D., &c., Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The population of the Lewisham District, estimated to the middle of the year 1884, amounted to 79,730, residing in 12,716 houses. Table I. gives the estimated population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place in the District during the year 1884 and the 10 previous years. Table II. gives the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates at the public institutions in the District for the same periods. Table III. gives the deaths registered at several group., of ages from different causes during the year. 2 Table IV. gives the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and the proportion to population, and to 1,000 deaths in 1884. Table V. gives the number of deaths in the 10 years, 1874 to 1883 inclusive, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in the year 1884. Table VI. gives the Inspectors' Reports of the sanitary work completed during the year. Table VII. gives the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population in 1884, with the birth and death rate in the Registrar's Sub-districts in the Lewisham Parish, and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising "the Lewisham District." Table VIII. gives the population, the number of persons to an acre of ground, the number of births and deaths, also the mean temperature and rainfall in London and 28 large towns of the United Kingdom. Table IX. The number of children attending public elementary and certified efficient schools in the Parish of Lewisham and in the Hamlet of Penge during the year 1884. Table X. A Register of the licensed cow-houses in the District, together with a list of the milk sellers in the District who have no licenses. Table XI. A list of the licensed slaughter-houses in the District. 3 Marriages. During the year 1884, 378 Marriages took place in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 302 were solemnized in the several Church of England Churches, 30 in Dissenting Chapels, and 46 at the Registrar's Office. During the year 1884, 125 Marriages took place in the Hamlet of Penge, of which 109 were solemnized in Church of England Churches, 6 in Dissenting Chapels, and 10 at the Registrar's Office. Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1884 amounted to 2,316. Males 1,231. Females 1,085. The Birth Rate to population was 29 05 per 1,000. In London 137,495 births were registered, the annual Birth Rate being- 33.7 per 1,000, being the lowest birth rate since 1860, in which year the rate was 33.6. In England and Wales 771,089 were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 33 3 per 1,000. The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths in the Lewisham district was 1,206. Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1884 was 1,110, being 58 more than the number registered during the previous year. 4 The annual rate of mortality per 1,000 was 13.92. The annual rate of mortality of England and Wales in the year 1884 was 19.3. In the Metropolitan and City Police Districts 19.7. In Registration London, 20.3; and in the district outside Registration London, 175 per 1,000. By reference to Table III., which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be seen that, of the 1,110 Deaths registered from all causes in 1884, 454 died under the age of 5 years, of which number 290 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 290 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 97 between the ages of 1 and 2 67 „ „ 2 „ 5 50 „ „ 5 „ 15 47 „ „ 15 „ 25 63 „ „ 25 „ 35 84 „ „ 35 „ 45 82 „ „ 45 „ 55 98 „ „ 55 „ 65 107 „ „ 65 „ 75 101 „ „ 75 „ 85 23 „ „ 85 „ 95 1 „ „ 95 and upwards. Of the diseases which produced the mortality at these ages— 5 205 took place from zymotic diseases. 228 ,, „ constitutional diseases. 467 „ „ local diseases. 181 „ „ developmental diseases. 29 „ „ violent deaths. Water Supply. The water supplied to this District by the various Companies still continues to be of good quality; that of the Kent Company being remarkably clear and free from impurity. The most important point therefore for consumers is, to see that cisterns are properly covered, kept well cleansed, and have no direct communication with the drain by means of the waste-pipe. Sewer Gas. A warm dry summer has passed without the occurrence of any outbreak of disease dependent on the escape of sewer gas. This has been mainly due to the constant watchfulness of the Board's Officers and the continual disinfection and flushing of the sewers. Isolated cases have of course appeared and nothing can prevent this unless tenants are more careful in seeing that their drains are properly trapped and provided with a proper ventilating shaft, and that there is no direct communication between them and the kitchen sinks. Cow Houses and Dairies. These are constantly inspected and invariably found in a clean and satisfactory condition. The cows are healthy and 6 well cared for, the majority being turned out to pasture during the summer months. The Board's Hospital. The Hospital for the reception of patients suffering from epidemic disease is now the freehold property of the Board of Works of the Lewisham District, and the new building is now completed. It is well situated, being in a locality far away from inhabited houses and at a good elevation, and has a Resident Nurse ready fur the reception of patients. Ambulances are kept at Lewisham and Penge, for the conveyance of patients suffering from infectious disease. The importance of this establishment cannot be overestimated, for whenever a case of epidemic disease is removed in order to prevent its communication to others, it confers a benefit on the general public. On this ground the payment for the maintenance and medical attendance should be as low as possible to the friends of the patient. In accordance with this view, by a Resolution of the Board, dated 23rd June, 1880, the payment was fixed at one guinea per week, such charge to include maintenance and medical attendance. The charge for the ambulance is only the actual cost incurred in each case for horse hire. Disinfection. One disinfecting apparatus, for the purpose of disinfecting 7 the wearing apparel, bedding, &c., of those who have suffered from epidemic disease, is placed at Lewisham, and another at Penge. Covered iron carts are in readiness to fetch and deliver apparel, &c. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the Lewisham District. 8 TABLE I. Population, Inhabited Houses, Births, Deaths, and Marriages. (gross numbers).

SURVEYOR'S REPORT Of Work executed from Lady-day 1884, to Lady-day, 1885. Gentlemen, It is with much pleasure I submit my Report on work executed in my department during the last financial year, such being my Sixteenth Annual Report. HIGHWAYS. The following Table shows the quantity of material paid for during the year for the maintenance of the Public Roads in the District: — Division. Granite. Port Philip Stone. Dug Flints. Picked Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Parish (cubic yards) 5130 1714 2985 ... 1632 11,461 Hamlet of Penge (ditto) 820 ... ... 809 507 2136 Total 5950 1714 2985 809 2139 13,597 The Rainfall, as recorded at the Forest Hill Stone Yard rainguage from the 26th March, 1884, to the 25th March, 1885, was as follows:— Numbor of days on which rain fell. inches. 0 1884 March 26th to 31st inclusive 0.00 12 „ April 1.05 11 „ May 0.62 7 „ June 2.00 14 „ July 1.86 6 „ August 0.85 12 ,, September 1.79 11 ,, October 0.96 9 „ November 0.99 17 „ December 1.99 2 Rainfall—Continued. Numbor of days on which rain fell. inches. 14 1885 January 1.60 19 „ February 1.89 5 „ March, to 25th inclusive 1.44 137 17.04 From the above it will appear that rain fell on 137 days, and 1.55 inches less rain fell this year than in the corresponding period last year. As there was so little frost and rain daring the year, the the roads were maintained with a less quantity of material than estimated. The Roads are in good condition. The repairs to the High Street, Lewisham, have been kept back in expectation of the Tramway being laid: I have now this road under repair. Three new Slop Carts were purchased. I find the difficulty of disposing of the slop and road sweepings increases year by year, as the old shoots are closed and done away with, by reason of building operations, &c. ROAD WATERING. The greater part of the Road Watering at Blackheath was done by Mr. George Sabin, of Rushey Green, at a contract price of 9s. per horse, harness, and driver per day. The road watering in Lewisham, Rushey Green, and Southend was chiefly done by the Board's own horses and men. Mr. Wm. Stimpson supplied horses, harness, and men for road watering at Sydenham and Forest Hill, at 8s. 8d. per day. Mr. R. Hatchings did the work of road watering in Lower Sydenham, at 8s. 6d. per day for horse, harness, and driver. Mr. R. Winnifrith carried out the road watering in the Hamlet of Penge, at 7s. Gd. per horse, harness, and driver per day. The water vans and carts were supplied bv the Board in all cases. The Table below will give the number of miles watered in each Division during the year:— Locality. Miles. Yards. Blackhcath and Lewisham 20 39 Sydenham and Forest Hill 21 782 Hamlet of Penge 11 1105 Total 53 166 3 STREET LIGHTING. At present there are in the Parish of Lewisham 672 lamps lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company and 714 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. In the Hamlet of Penge there are 365 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. The present charges for lighting the ordinary street lamps, including lighting, extinguishing, cleaning, painting, &c., are : The Crystal Palace District Gas Company, £3 10s. 9d. per lamp per annum, and the South Metropolitan Gas Company £3 12s. 6d. per lamp per annum. The Crystal Palace District Gas Company reduced the price 1s. 7d. per lamp per annum from Lady-day last. The South Metropolitan Gas Company, in accordance with their letter of the 21st February, 1884, which I mentioned in my last Report, increased the price 10s. per lamp per annum for lamps more than 75 yards apart (the statutory distance), and £1 per lamp per annum for lamps more than double the statutory distance viz., 150 yards apart, this came into operation at Michaelmas. I prepared a special plan and register of the distances apart of all the lamps lighted by this Company, and by moving several lamps, and erecting new ones, the number of overdistance lamps has been reduced to 24. The following will show the new lamps erected:— Lewisham. Adelaide Road 2 Bath Place 1 Berlin Road 2 Blythe Hill 1 Blythe Hill Lane 1 Bradgate Road 2 Bromley Road (Rushey Green) 1 Brookdale Road 2 Burghill Road 3 Cockshed Lane 3 Colfe Road 1 Comerford Road 2 Dacres Road 3 Devonshire Road 1 4 Lewisham—Continued.

Bray's lanterns and burners was fixed at the approach to Lewisham Junction Railway Station. Six lanterns of a new pattern were fixed with the ordinary burners, by way of experiment. 5 COLLECTION OF DUST, &c. The Dust and Ashes from the Parish of Lewisham were collected by horses and carts belonging to the Board, with an additional hired horse when required. The Parish was divided into five Districts, and the dust was sold by contract, as will be seen by the following Table :— Lewisham Parish. No. and Locality of District. Contract Price per Load.

This sewer is twenty feet below the surface of the road, and is being laid on a cushion of concrete about half way up the pipes. 10 A register of the temperature of the water or liquid flowing from Messrs. Morgan's brewery into the Perry Yale sewer was carefully kept, and much time was spent in making investigations (see Surveyor's Reports, Minutes, 1884, pages 17 and 205). Messrs. Morgan constructed circulating channels, and by means of such, and introducing a jet of cold water into the channels, succeeded in considerably reducing the temperature of the liquid coming from their brewery. On account of the little rainfall the ventilators of some of the sewers were unusually offensive during the hot weather. I had recourse to additional flushing, by means of water carts, the water being mixed with permanganate of potash. Some days there were four water carts doing nothing else but flushing sewers. For a long time past I have had an idea of introducing a system of automatic flushing for the sewers in the District. With a view of putting the matter to a practical test I recommended, in July, 1883, the construction of a tilt flusher in the Stoney Lane sewer. In September last I suggested the construction of a flushing tank, with a self-acting syphon, in the Kneller Road sewer, and again in December I recommended the use of a similar tank in the sewer Anerley Park, Penge. All these tanks were put in on account of constant complaints of the ventilators smelling, and I am pleased to be able to say they have answered admirably I have not heard any complaints of such sewers during the hot dry weather. I hope to submit a Report shortly to the Board, recommending the construction of other tanks, &c., and before next summer I feel sure a moderate sum spent in this way would be fully appreciated by the public. Although I know the sewers to be in good condition, and the low death rate testifies to the healthy state of the District, still I am most anxious to prevent, as far as possible, the ventilators smelling. I am certain the best means of doing this in ordinary cases is by means of a self-acting system of flushing. The old adage says, "Prevention is better than cure," and it is by means of effectual flushing that deposits are removed, and no time allowed for the collection of foul air. I should like to see the system carried further, and adopted in the house drains, every house to have a tank and syphon, or other arrangement to periodically flush the drains. I know the expense of the water used, &c., would at once be urged against this, but landlords and tenants should consider that, in the long run, it would probably 11 prove a saving. My experience tells me that the most prolific cause of the stoppage of drains is the want of sufficient flushing, and by the use of the tank the risk of a stoppage in the drain would be reduced to a minimum. The Ivy Lane Sewer drains the Lewisham and Deptford Cemeteries, and at times the atmosphere of the sewer is very bad. In order to disinfect such, coke has been burnt in three of the man-holes for some months. The air of the sewer is now much improved, but it is expensive keeping up the coke fires, and if the same results could be obtained by flushing it would be cheaper. The last of the cesspools upon Sydenham Hill was drained into the sewer in Longton Avenue in January. For something like twelve years I have been endeavouring to attain this result. NEW ROADS. The road mentioned in my last Annual Report as sanctioned, in continuation of Brownhill Road to Hither Green Lane, is now being made, at the cost of Earl St. Germans, and I expect will be soon opened for traffic. Several trees were planted to replace those that had died or been destroyed. SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE. The following Table shows the Surface Water Drains sanctioned:— Locality. Length in feet. Size.

The following is a list of the Bills deposited affecting the District:— 1. The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Bill. 2. The Beckenham, South Norwood, and Crystal Palace Railway Bill. 3. Crystal Palace, South Eastern, and Metropolitan way Bill. 4. The South Eastern (Various Powers) Bill. 5. The London, Chatham, and Dover Railway (Further Powers) Bill. 6. The Crystal Palace, Anerley, and Gipsey Hill ways Bill. The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Bill was a Scheme promoted by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company to construct a reservoir on high ground near the boundary of the District at Honor Oak Road. The Beckenham, South Norwood, and Crystal Palace Railway was a project to construct three short lines to connect the South Eastern Railway at Elmer's End and the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway (Crystal Palace and Beckenham Branch) with Crystal Palace High Level Station. This line did not interfere with the roads. It was withdrawn. Crystal Palace, South Eastern, and Metropolitan Bill. This scheme commenced at the South Eastern (New Cross Station) and entered the Lewisham District near the Honor Oak Park Road, and terminated in the Crystal Palace Grounds. The bill was withdrawn. South Eastern (Various Powers Bill). Powers are sought to widen the South Eastern main line from the Junction with the Dartford Loop Line, through the Lewisham District to St. John's Station. The Board determined to oppose the Bill, as there are several objectionable bridges, &c. The result of that opposition will be mentioned in my next report. The London, Chatham, and Dover (Further Powers) Bill. This was a revival of the old idea of connecting Nunhead with the London, Chatham, and Dover main line at Shortlands; but 13 the route was a good deal varied from the line deposited last year. The Scheme was abandoned at an early stage. The Crystal Palace, Anerley, and Gipsey Hill Tramways Bill. The proposed Tramways connected Gipsey Hill Station (London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway), Crystal Palace Station (London, Chatham, and Dover Railway), Crystal Palace and Anerley Stations (London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway). The Tramways were to be laid in the roads between these Stations. By far the greater length was in the Hamlet of Penge. The Board was opposed to the Scheme. The gradients, &c., were unsuitable. The Bill did not go forward. Notices were given of a projected Railway called the Crystal Palace (High Level, Beulah, and Beckenham Railway), but no plans, &c., were deposited. The Bill was withdrawn. I was engaged during the year on the opposition of the East of London, Crystal Palace, and South Eastern Junction Bill. It was thrown out by the Committee of the House of Commons. BOROUGH OF LEWISHAM. I prepared several plans showing the new Borough of Lewisham, with a view of including the Beckenham tongue of land, &c., and I attended at Maidstone when the Commissioner sat. FLOODING, FRONTAGE LINES, &c. The rainfall during the year being so little, I am glad to say no flooding occurred. An alteration is now being carrried out to the stalls, &c., in the Board's stables. Twenty-eight applications were sent from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works for suggestions, and I attended before the Building Act Committee in most of the cases. One hundred and four plans and tracings were prepared; also a large number of estimates, reports, and letters written. I append to this Report a list of "New Streets" sanctioned. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble Servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst., Surveyor to the Board. The Board of Works for the Lemsham District. 14 NEW STREETS SANCTIONED.
