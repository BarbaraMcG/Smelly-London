To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell: Gentlemen, In this, which is my Sixth Annual Report upon the Sanitary condition of the District, I do myself the honor of laying before you the numerical details of the deaths which have occurred during the past year, with comments upon the causes and influences to which they have been related. The number of deaths which occurred from all causes in the district during the year 1861, was 1494 ; the average of the last ten years being 1427 ; hence the deaths were 67 above the average. In 1857, the total number of deaths was 1406 ; in 1858, 1477 ; in 1859, 1S74; and in 1860, 1383; so that in 1861, the deaths were 111 more than in 1860. Every year, a certain number of the inhabitants of the district die in General and Special Hospital, and in Lunatic Asylums. The number of these estimated for 1861, amounts to 102; thus producing a total of 1596. The births which took place in the year were 2295; the natural increase of the population thus amounting to 801. In 1860, the births were 2279, hence 16 fewer than in the past year. The number of deaths from Zymotic diseases was 381 ; that for 1860, being 266 ; for 1859, 329; for 1858, 327; and for 1557, 340. „ 16 The number of deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases was 340 ; the kinds of diseases, as also the number occurring daring the preceding four years are shown by the subjoined table: Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough | Diarrhoea. Typhus. (In fever hospital) Totals. 1857 6 51 42 84 65 47 (9) 295 1858 5 69 64 61 55 31 (8) 285 1859 9 24 82 87 68 31 (6) 301 1860 10 39 50 62 38 27 (5) 226 1861 0 22 95 107 72 44 (17) 340 707 deaths occurred in infants and children under 5 years of age. In 1860, the number was 624; in 1859, 628; in 1858, 656; and in 1857, 663. 318 deaths took place at and above 60; including 50 at and above 80. 279 deaths arose from Tubercular or Consumptive deseases. 284 deaths arose from Pulmonary diseases. 160 deaths took place in the Workhouse. 20 deaths occurred in the House of Correction; none in the House of Detention. These are the principal numerical results of the analysis of the causes of deaths for the past year ; the details are given in the appended table. On comparing these numbers with those of former years, it is at once evident that the year 1861 has been decidedly unfavorable in a sanitary point of view, and that the low mortality of the two preceding years has not been maintained. The deaths from all causes were 111 more than in 1860; those from Zymotic diseases being 115 more than in the preceding year. On deducting the number of deaths arising from Zymotic diseases in 1860, from the number arising from all causes, we have 1117 deaths from other than Zymotic diseases ; whilst for the year 1861, the number was 1113. It is thus evident, that the increase has consisted entirely of Zymotic diseases ; the other division of diseases, or those least amenable to sanitary measures, being slightly reduced in number. 17 In fact, the increase is mainly owing to the larger number of deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases, viz. : Scarlet Fever, Hooping Cough, Diarrhoea, and Typhus, exclusive of Measles and Small Pox. On examining the above table, it will be seen, that no deaths arose from Small Pox, whilst in 1860, there were 10. The deaths from Measles were 17 fewer than in 1860. Whilst those from Scarlet Fever were 45 more, 20 being registered as arising from Diphtheria; from Hooping Cough, also 45 more; from Diarrhoea, 34 more ; and from Typhus, 17 more, exclusive of 17 deaths which took place in the Fever Hospital. This great increase in the mortality cannot be attributed to unfavourable sanitary influences existing specially in the district, for the same increase has occurred in the metropolis generally. Thus, the deaths from all causes occurring in the entire metropolis in 1861, amounted to 65,001 ; whilst they were only 61,821 in 1860; the average of the last 10 years being 61,022. The deaths from Zymotic diseases in the metropolis were 15,710 in 1861, against 13,001 in 1860. And on comparing the deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases occurring in the metropolis generally, in the year 1861 and 1860, the deaths from Measles, were 1070 against 2054 ; those from Scarlet Fever, 3055 against 2457; from Hooping Cough, 3497 against 2023; and those from Typhus, 1754 against 1392. So that, in the entire metropolis, just as in this district, whilst there have been fewer deaths from Measles, the number from Scarlet Fever, Hooping Cough and Typhus, has largely increased. Hence the cause of the increased mortality has been general to the metropolis, and not special to this district. Considering the numerous sanitary improvements which have been made in the Parish during the last five years, it must appear striking that the Zymotic mortality should have increased so largely. It must be borne in mind however, that the principal sanitary improvements have related almost exclusively to the drainage ; whilst the overcrowding and the impure state of the dwellings of the poor have been but little interfered with. Now as the form of Fever which has been most prevalent, viz.: true Typhus, in opposition to Typhoid fever, is more particularly infectious, especially where animal effluvia are abundant, we can see to a certain extent, why the sanitary improvements already effected have not done so much as might at first sight have been anticipated. That the prevalence of a more than ordinarily infectious form of fever is sufficient to produce a certain increase of mortality, has been shown at the Fever Hospital, where every sanitary precaution is adopted, yet three nurses have died there, and the resident medical officer has suffered from the disease. In this district, the cases of fever have frequently occurred many in a house, sometimes five or six, even in one room. When occurring in this way, the houses have always been overcrowded, mostly a separate family occupying each room, and in some rooms, two or three deaths have occurred, and this where the drainage 18 was in good order. The spread and fatality of the disease must therefore mainly be attributed to the overcrowding. The same remarks will apply to Scarlet Fever. The numbers of deaths in infants and children under five years of age has increased from 624 to 707. Increase must necessarily have occurred, as children are the principal sufferers from Zymotic diseases. I am quite certain that this extensive mortality might be greatly reduced by confining young children to a milk-diet. Among the poor, where often the mother has to work, the young children are not properly nursed, but fed upon too dry and too thick food. This causes enlargement of the glands of the abdomen, permanently impairing the nutrition of the body, and rendering it an easy prey to Zymotic diseases, as well as to infantile consumptive diseases—from which 111 deaths arose in the year under five, exclusive of 28 children of servants, dressmakers, and artificial flower-makers, which have undoubtedly arisen from this cause. The deaths at and above 60, were 318, against 229 in 1860. The deaths from consumptive diseases have risen from 253 in 1860, to 279. The deaths from Pulmonary diseases were 284. against 328 in 1860. The deaths in the workhouse increased from 120 in 1859, and 137 in 1860, to 160 in 1861. 20 deaths occurred in the House of Correction, against 15 in the preceding year. None took place in the House of Detention. The accidental deaths were 17 against 22 in 1860 ; 6 arising from the " accidental suffocation " of infants ; 5 from burns and scalds ; and 5 from fractures and contusions. Three infants were murdered. Four deaths arose from suicide against 9 in the preceding year, viz.: 1 from a wound, 1 from poison, and 2 from hanging. Two deaths arose from intemperance, against 5 in 1860. 73 patients were sent by the Parochial authorities to the Fever Hospital, and 7 to the Small Pox Hospital during the year. Slaughter-Houses— The 47 slaughter-houses, kept by 45 butchers, were inspected previously to the granting of licenses as usual. They were mostly in good order. Great complaint was made of the nuisance arising from the slaughter-house at 46, Exmouth Street: and on the complaint of an annoyed neighbour to the Magistrates at the Sessions, the license was suspended for a month. Vaults.—The coffins in the vaults of St. Mark's Church still remain as they were. The Order in Council for their interment was issued in January, 1860, but I am unacquainted with the reason why it has not been obeyed I believe that Clerkenwell is the only Parish in the metropolis in which these orders have not been long since carried out. Sanitary Improvements.—The following sanitary improvements in the drainage &c. of the district have been effected during the year: 19 590-feet of brick-sewers have been constructed; 61 sewers have been cleansed and repaired; 128 gullies have been cleansed, repaired, or trapped, 7 newly constructed; 115-inch, 3 12-inch, 14 9-inch, and 346-inch drains have been laid; 79 houses have been drained; 1 housedrain trapped; and 45 cesspools destroyed. Three urinals have been constructed. I regret however, to have to announce that at the two courts of justice—the Sessions House, and the Police Court, there is no urinal. As other sanitary improvements, may be mentioned, the enclosing of a portion of the New River in iron-pipes; the re-building of the houses in Fletcher's Row, and Little Sutton Street; the enclosing of the coffins of the vaults of St. John's Church, and the erection of new "Ragged" Schools in Lamb Square, and St. Paul's School, Allen Street. Appointment of Analyst.-On the 31st of January, 1861, the Vestry did me the honor of electing me Analyst of food &c., under the 23 and 24, Vict., c. 84. And in furtherance of carrying out the provisions of the Act, a hand-bill was drawn up, printed and circulated, stating the terms and powers of the Act, so that the inhabitants of the district might take advantage of them. The working of the Act however, as regards section 4, proved completely nugatory, for but two articles of food were sent to me for analysis under its provisions during the 15 months I held the appointment. And in regard to section 1, in which the Analyst is empowered to enforce a penalty for the sale of adulterated articles, the risk of having to pay the costs on appeal, and the expenses of the analysis was too great to allow of my preceding under that section. During the year, I had occasion to point out the dangerous properties of the material used for making the so-called steel ornaments for bonnets; from the use of which 1 saw two well-marked cases of poisoning. The material I found by analysis to consist of pounded mineral Galena, or native sulphuret of lead, and not of steel or iron. This powder gaining admission to the body accidentally with the food, produces the ordinary symptons of lead poisoning. I directed attention also to the poisonous nature of the fly-papers, each of which contains enough arsenic to kill an adult. In conclusion, I regret that the low mortality of the two preceding years has not been preserved. The mortality among children has been enormous. Undoubtedly the occupation of single rooms by entire families, has had much to do with the increase of mortality from Zymotic diseases. For how is it possible to prevent the spread and fatality of fever or Hooping Cough, when six or seven persons are shut up in one small room breathing the same air, loaded with the Zymotic poison, over and over again ? In the case of Small Pox, vaccination is a positive and certain means of ensuring a mild form of the disease, with the smallest amount of the morbid poison regenerated in the body of the sufferer, and thrown off so as to affect the healthy. In fact, the unusual prevalence of Small 20 Pox may safely be said to arise from arrears of vaccination. Thus in 1859, there were 1156 deaths from Small Pox in the metropolis. In the beginning of 1860, the Privy Council directed the special attention of the Vestries and the Parochial Boards to the importance of further promoting vaccination. The consequence was, that in 1860, the deaths •were reduced to 877, and in 1861, they were only 215. But in the case of the above mentioned diseases, there is no equivalent to vaccination; all that can be done is, to avoid infection, and to ensure a free supply of pure air in the dwelling rooms, to dilute or destroy the morbid poisons, and this by insisting that no family shall occupy a room in which each person has not at least 300 cubic feet of air. I would respectfully suggest to the Vestry, that sufficient attention has not been paid to this point. At least it might well be insisted, when an outbreak of infectious disease occurs, and spreads in an overcrowded house, that the house should be inspected, and the occupants of the several apartments should be limited to their proper number. At the same time, it must also be taken into account, that the year has been unfavourable in a trade point of view ; and that a large number of the poorer class have been out of work. These circumstances cause a reduction in the supply of food for the poorer families, and so the health becomes lowered,, and the sufferers form an easier prey to disease. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. W. GRIFFITH, M D. October 9tk, 1862. T. Goode, Printer, Clerkenwell Green. DEATHS REGISTERED IN CLERKENWELL IN 1861.
