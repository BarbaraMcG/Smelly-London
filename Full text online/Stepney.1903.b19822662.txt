STE 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 1 9 O 3. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST, FOR THE YEAR 1903. To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting to you my third Annual Report, which deals with the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Borough of Stepney for 1903. Population. The population estimated to the middle of the year was 302,153, distributed as follows:— Limehouse District 58,184 St. George's „ 50,140 Mile End „ 114,452 Whitechapel „ 79,377 4 Births. The total number of births registered during the year was 11,271, which consisted of 5,750 males and 5,521 females. 1,863 births were registered in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 32 per 1,000 of the population. 2,067 were registered in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 41.2 per 1,000 of the population. 4,474 were registered in Mile End Old Town, or at the rate of 39 per 1,000 of the population. 2,867 were registered in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 36.1 per 1,000 of the population. The birth-rate for the whole of the Borough was equal to 37.6 per 1,000. The birth-rate in the previous year was 37.5, and the average for the previous ten years was 37.8 per 1,000. The birth-rate varies in the various parts of the Borough. It is less in the Limehouse District than in the other three districts. In the Limehouse District it has not varied much since 1898, when there was an appreciable decline from the previous year. The average for the previous ten years was 33.2 per 1,000. The birth-rate in the St. George's District was much lower than in the previous year, which was 44.1. It is lower than in any year since 1894, and indeed, with two exceptions, it is the lowest since 1890. The average for the ten years 1893-1902 was 43.2 per 1,000. The birth-rate in the Mile End District was much higher than in the previous year, when it was 30.1 per 1,000. It is higher than the average for the previous ten years, which was 36.9 per 1,000. The birth-rate in the Whitechapel District steadily decreased from 1891 to 1901. In the latter year there was an increase of 3.6 per 1,000 over the previous year. The rate, however, in 1903 was 1.7 per 1,000 less than the average of the previous ten years. 5 What is t.he reason of this disparity? I am of opinion that immigration is accountable for it. In the Limehouse District the birth-rate is only slightly higher than that for the whole of London. In this part of the district, where there is less immigration, there is less change than in the other three districts. The people that immigrate are married people of a child-bearing age. Consequently the larger the number of persons of this age-period in a district the greater will be the number of children born. Applying this theory, one would expect the highest birthrate to be in the St. George's District, and the lowest in the Limehouse District, which is actually the case. The birth-rate in each of the four districts is higher than that for the whole of London, which was 28.4 per 1,000 of the population. Marriages. The marriages during the year numbered 2,839, or 126 more than in the corresponding period of last year. The proportion of persons married was 18.7 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was 17.4 per 1,000. 438 marriages occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 15 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 245 marriages occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 9.7 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 1,590 marriages occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 27.7 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 566 marriages occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 14.2 persons married per 1,000 of the population. The proportion of persons married in each 1,000 of the population throughout London was 17.4. It will be seen that here again there is great disparity in the various districts. The number in St. George's is very small. I think, however, that the explanation given with regard to the high birth-rate is applicable here as well. The people that immigrate into the district are young married people. The marriages occur 6 among the people that have lived in the district for some years. That is, the number of young people in St. George's that get married and settle down in the district is small compared to the number of families that come to live in the district and have been married a few years previously. Deaths. The total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 5,683 Deduct deaths occurring within the Borough among persons not belonging thereto 976 4,707 Add deaths of residents outside the Borough 730 5,437 The deaths therefore, including those of residents which occurred in Out-lying Institutions, but exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the Borough, numbered 5,437. This corresponds to a death-rate of 17.9 per 1,000 of the population. 1,148 occurred in the Limeliouse District, or at the rate of 19.7 per 1,000. 1,020 „ „ St. George's „ „ „ 20.3 „ 1,876 „ „ Mile End „ „ „ 16.3 „ 1,393 „ „ Whitechapel „ „ „ 17.5 „ Though the death-rate is still higher than that for the whole of London for the same period, which was 15.2 per 1,000, it is much less than that for the previous year, and also a great deal less than the average for the last ten years. This is true not only of the Borough as a whole, but also of each individual district. As far as I am able to ascertain from previous reports, the death-rate has never been so low in the four districts as it was in 1903. What makes it perhaps more satisfactory is the gradual and progressive decline which has taken place during the last four years, as is shown by the following table:— 7  Limehouse District. St. George's District. Mile End District. Whitechapel District. Whole Borough. Average of 10 years, 1893 to 1902 25.1 25.9 20.5 20.3 22.2 1899 25.5 27.1 20.3 19.3 22 1900 25.9 24.4 19.3 18 21 1901 24.6 23 18.5 19.3 20.8 1902 23.6 22.1 19.0 19.2 20.5 1903 19.7 20.3 16.3 17.5 17.9 Compared with 1902 the causes of death were:— Disease. 1902. 1903.

From September, 1901, to October, 1902, 1,410 cases of Small Pox occurred in the Borough, of which 283 proved fatal. No other case occurred from October 14th, 1902, to January 29th, 1903, when two men were removed from 41, Commercial Street, a common lodging house. They were Guy Sutton, aged 29, and Richard Timmins, aged 33. The former had never been vaccinated and the latter was vaccinated in infancy only. One other person was removed from this address, Wm. Wood, aged 49, who was taken ill on February loth and removed to the hospital on February 17th. He was vaccinated in infancy. 12 I could not discover how the disease was contracted in the first instance. None of these had done any work for some time, but had daily marched through the streets with the unemployed for about three weeks. They may have come in contact with persons suffering from the disease in this way. On January 29th Samuel Laidlow, aged 61, was admitted to the St. George's Workhouse. On January 31st he was taken ill, and removed to the Small Pox Hospital on February 2nd, where he died on February 5th. He had been vaccinated in infancy only. During the fortnight previous to his being admitted to the Workhouse he had for the greater part of the time slept in the streets, but had slept one night only at each of two different common lodging houses in Leman Street, one night at the Seamans' Mission, Well Street, and one night at 106, St. George Street—another common lodging house. On February 3rd Esther Brettell, aged 34, Seamans'Mission Hall, Well Street, was removed to the hospital. She had been ill for nearly a week. The patient was vaccinated in infancy only. On February 16th Elizabeth Fleming, aged 36, of 43, Bromhead Street, was taken ill and removed to the hospital on February 18th. She had been vaccinated in infancy only. Mrs. Fleming was employed in the St. George's Workhouse Laundry. She had washed Laidlow's clothing before it was known that he was actually suffering from Small Pox. Two other persons resided at the above address, Robert Foster, aged 25, and Hannah Foster, aged 23. The latter had been recently vaccinated, but the former had been vaccinated in infancy only. On March 3rd, Robert Foster was taken ill and was removed to the hospital on March 5th. I was informed by the Medical Superintendent of the St. George's Infirmary that when the first case occurred all the officers, both permanent and temporary, at the workhouse had been vaccinated, but that Mrs. Fleming was by an oversight overlooked. She was the only officer that contracted Small Pox. On February 19th Charles Wilson, aged 66, was removed from the St. George's Workhouse to the Small Pox Hospital, where he died on February 24th. He had been vaccinated in infancy only. Wilson had been an inmate since November 21st 1902. On March 4th a person unknown was turned out of an eating-house, 70, Wentworth Street. He was, however, known by sight as a frequenter of common lodging houses. When the patient was turned out of the eating-house, it was observed that he was very ill, and the attention of two police officers was called to him. These 13 officers removed him to the Whitechapel Infirmary, where lie died immediately afterwards from Small Pox. Condition as to vaccination unknown. He was 30 to 35 years of age. The ambulance that was used to carry him to the Infirmary was fumigated, and the clothing of the police officers disinfected. No other case occurred through this one. On April 6th, Mary Marney, aged 42, of 15, Graces Alley, Well Street, was removed to the Small Pox Hospital. She had been vaccinated in infancy only. Immediately the patient was removed, all the other residents were vaccinated, with the exception of one person. Four adults and four children were thus vaccinated. On April 19th, Mary Caldwell, aged 19—who was the only person in 15, Graces Alley, who refused to be vaccinated—was taken ill and removed to the hospital on April 22nd. She had been vaccinated in infancy only. On May 24th, Thomas Piatt, aged 18, of 17, Dorset Street, Whitechapel—a common lodging house—was taken ill, and removed to the Small Pox Hospital on May 27th. He had been vaccinated in infancy only. Piatt was a newsvendor, and had slept regularly at this address for about three weeks. On June 3rd, Walter White, aged 48, was removed from the same address to the hospital. He had never been vaccinated. On October 22nd, Isaac Rein, aged 20, of 31, Grey Eagle Street, was removed to the Small Pox Hospital. He had been vaccinated in infancy only. He arrived in England on October 22nd from Hamburg on SS. Sylvia. On October 24th, Emanuel Blanket, aged 19, of 53, Tarling Street, was taken ill and removed to the Small Pox Hospital on October 28th. He had been vaccinated in infancy only. Blanket was a hairdresser, and worked at 94, Waterloo Road, Southwark, where three other persons had been recently removed to the Small Pox Hospital. On December 22nd, Esther E. Avis, aged 14, of 12, Mcnsey Street, was taken ill and removed to the Small Pox Hospital on December 26th. She had been vaccinated in infancy. Two days afterwards her brother, John D. Avis, aged 3, was removed to the hospital. He was not vaccinated. I could not trace where these children had contracted the disease. On December 23rd, Sarah Slacks, aged 19, of 30, St. Dunstan's Road, was taken ill and removed to the hospital on December 29th. She had never been vaccinated. 14 These 18 cases were distributed as follows:— Limehouse District Nil. St. George's District 2 Mile End District 5 Whitechapel District 2 St. George's Workhouse 2 Whitechapel Common Lodging Houses 7 Four of the cases were those of unvaccinated persons. All recovered. Thirteen had been vaccinated in infancy only, and two died. Both these persons were over 60 years of age. All those that had been vaccinated in infancy were over 14 years of age. One case that proved fatal was doubtful as to age and the condition as to vaccination.. The disease was in such a stage when first seen by a medical man that it oould not be ascertained whether he had vaccination scars or not. Measles. The number of deaths was 162, or 4 more than in the preceding year. 42 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .72 per 1,000 of the population. 39 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .78 per 1,000 of the population. 48 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .42 per 1,000 of the population. 33 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .42 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole Borough was at the rate of .50 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was .45 per 1,000. Though the death-rate in this Borough was high, it was lower than in the three adjacent Boroughs. The London County Council made an order that certain sections of the Public Health Act should apply to Measles. This Order was approved by the Local Government Board and came into force on April 1st of this year. 15 The following is a brief summary of the sections referred to, as supplied by the London County Council in their communication of March 16th:— Section 60 gives power to sanitary authorities to require the cleansing and disinfection of infected houses or parts cf houses, and the disinfection or destruction of infected articles, and requires them to pay compensation for articles destroyed or for unnecessary damage caused by disinfection, and to provide, free of charge, temporary accommodation for the shelter of persons during the disinfection of the dwellings. Section 61 enables sanitary authorities to require infected bedding, clothing, or other articles, to be delivered up to them for disinfection or destruction, and provides that they shall pay compensation for any unnecessary damage or for articles destroyed. Any person failing to comply with a notice by the sanitary authority under this section is liable to a fine not exceeding Ten Pounds. Section 62 prohibits persons from knowingly casting, or causing or permitting to be cast, infectious rubbish into ashpits without previous disinfection. Any person infringing the provisions of this section is liable to a fine not exceeding Five Pounds, and to a further fine of Forty Shillings for every day during which the offence continues after notice of such provision has been served upon the master of the house by the sanitary authority, which shall on his request provide for the removal and disinfection or destruction of the aforesaid rubbish. Section 63 prohibits persons, under a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds, from knowingly letting houses or parts of houses in which infected persons have been lodging until such premises have been disinfected, and until all infected articles therein have been disinfected or destroyed. For the purposes of this section the keeper of an inn shall be deemed to let for hire part of a house to any person admitted as a guest into such inn. Section 64 provides that any person letting, or showing for the purpose of letting, a house or part of a house, who knowingly makes a false statement as to a case of infectious disease being, or having within six weeks previously been, therein, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Twenty Pounds or to a month's imprisonment with or without hard labour. Section 65 provides for a penalty not exceeding Ten Pounds, on persons ceasing to oocupy infected houses or parts of houses without disinfection or notice of the previous existence of the disease to the owner or master of the house or part of the house, or knowingly make a false answer to questions on the subject. 16 Section 68 prohibits, under a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds, the exposure of infected persons or articles without proper precautions against spreading the disease. Section 69 prohibits, under a penalty not exceeding Ten Pounds, infected persons from carrying on any occupation in such manner as to be likely to spread disease. Section 70 prohibits the conveyance of infected persons in public conveyances. The person responsible for such an offence is liable to a fine not exceeding Ten Pounds, and the driver of the conveyance is further liable to a fine not exceeding Five Pounds if, after conveying any such person, he fails to give notice to the Sanitary Authority and to have the conveyance disinfected. Section 72 prohibits, under a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds, the retention for more than forty-eight hours in a dwelling room, sleeping room or workroom, of the body of any person who has died of any infectious disease, unless such body is retained with the sanction in writing of a doctor. Section 73 requires that, in certain cases, the body of a person who has died in hospital of an infectious disease shall be removed only for burial. Any person wilfully offending against this section is liable to a fine not exceeding Ten Pounds. Section 74 prohibits, without previous notice to the owner or driver, the use of a public conveyance for carrying a body of a person who has died of an infectious disease, and requires the disinfection of the conveyance if so used. Any person offending against this section is liable to a fine not exceeding Five Pounds, and to a further fine not exceeding Forty Shillings for every day during which the offence continues. The remaining sections that refer to infectious diseases are Sections 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 66, 67, and 71. These sections are not included in the Order. Sections 55, 56 and 57 relate to the notification of infectious disease. Sections 66 and 67 relate to the removal to a hospital of persons without proper lodging accommodation and to their detention thereat. Section 71 relates to the inspection of dairies and the power to prohibit the sale of milk. 17 It will be seen on carefully perusing the sections that a person is liable to heavy penalties if he exposes infected clothing or allows a person suffering from Measles to be in a public place. It also makes it compulsory to have the premises disinfected after a patient has recovered from Measles. Yet it is the duty of no one to notify the Medical Officer of Health of the existence of the disease. How, then, is he to find out where people are suffering from Measles in order to have the premises disinfected ? In all the other diseases (where these sections apply) unless a medical man is in attendance, it is made compulsory on the head of the family, and in his absence on the nearest relative, to at once communicate with the Medical Officer of Health. In a number of cases no medical man is even called in to attend to a child suffering from Measles, and when he is, he is not obliged to notify. Therefore, the disease is not notified by the doctor in the usual way. Parents will not voluntarily give the necessary information to the Sanitary Authority, and thus bring upon themselves the resulting trouble and inconvenience of having their rooms, clothing, etc., disinfected. They regard Measles as a trivial disease, and in the light of a "necessary evil." Instead of isolating the patient, they generally allow the other children to come in contact with him, so that all the other children will have the disease and be laid up at the same time. Therefore, to expect them to voluntarily notify the disease is absurd. If we attempted to enforce the sections mentioned in the Order by Police Court proceedings, I am afraid we should meet with failure on each occasion. As it is not compulsory either to notify or to call in a doctor, how are we to prove that the parents knew that the patient suffered from Measles? If they informed the Magistrate that they did not know that the disease was Measles, we could not contradict them, and the case would be at once dismissed. It is true that we often receive information from the teachers of the Board Schools that children are absent from school through Measles. This information is not of much use, as we cannot very well verify the statement. The Medical Officer of Health has neither the power nor the time to visit these premises to verify the statements as to whether the children are suffering from Measles or not. Besides, by the time he receives the information from the School the specific symptoms have perhaps disappeared, and it would then be impossible for anyone to diagnose the disease with any certainty. The information received from the teachers is far from being conclusive evidence that the child is really suffering from Measles. The source of their knowledge is either the attendance officer who has called to inquire the reason of the child's absence, and has been informed that the child has Measles, or possibly another child from the same family informs the teacher that the reason of the child's absence is due to an illness. When pressed as to what he is suffering from, he replies that it is Measles. Both these sources are unreliable, and do not justify B 18 the expense and inconvenience the people may be put to, by having the rooms disinfected. In most cases the entire house requires fumigating if the process is going to be of any service at all, as by the time the information has reached the sanitary authority the child is frequently convalescent and has been wandering about in every room. During an epidemic, when perhaps the school would be closed, and during a vacation, we would be without even this scanty information. Moreover, this system of communicating the fact that children are absent from, school, through illness, is confined to Board Schools, and does not apply to voluntary and private schools. Furthermore, Section 70 prohibits the conveyance of infected persons in public conveyances. The person responsible is liable to a fine of £10, and the driver is further liable to a penalty of £5, if this section be contravened. Suppose a child is brought to a hospital from a distance, and a doctor at that institution diagnoses measles? How is that child to be taken home again? The hospital authorities will not take him into the hospital if they can possibly help it, as it is not a suitable case to be taken into the wards. At the time the Order came into force the Metropolitan Asylums Board would not remove him to his home. The officials of the Asylums Board have often refused to remove cases to any place except to their own hospitals. This question was raised by the East London Hospital for Children, and as a result of their and our representation the Metropolitan Asylums Board now consent to remove such cases to their own homes. I am afraid this is not often done. If a child has Measles and the parents consider that he should be seen by a doctor, in a large number of cases the doctor is not sent for, but for economic reasons the child is taken to the surgery. If the sections are to be enforced, the doctor must keep the patient isolated until he is removed home by one of the Board's ambulances, and to have his consulting and waiting rooms disinfected. Is this procedure carried out? I am afraid not. With respect to Small Pox, Diphtheria and the other notifiable diseases it is carried out to the letter. If Measles were made notifiable the parents would have more respect for the disease, and instead of taking the patient to see the doctor, they would call the doctor to visit the patient. They would not, as a general rule, run the risk of being prosecuted for not supplying the necessary information to the Sanitary Authority. Before the Local Government Board confirmed the Order of the London County Council, the Stepney Borough Council strongly protested against it. The Local Government Board's reply, however, was to the effect that the Board did not find any sufficient reason for withholding their approval to the proposal, and that by this step the public might be led to regard more seriously than they did in many cases at present the dangers attaching to the infection of Measles. I grant that if the sections relating to measles were made notifiable, the latter part of their 19 reply might reasonably be justified. As it stands, however, the action taken may have a contrary effect. It may affect the consideration that the public have for the other infectious diseases, and induce them to treat the conditions relating to disinfection and isolation of the other diseases with the same contempt that they now affect for Measles. After having had a few months' experience of the sections in question, I am still of opinion that they are useless. I do not consider that the sections will be of any use unless Measles is put on exactly the same footing as the Notifiable Diseases. To make Measles a notifiable disease in the usual way would be expensive, and it is questionable whether the expenditure would be justified. It is true that it has been tried in many of the large provincial towns, but the conditions are somewhat different. In all the places where the experiment has been made, a certain number only of the patients were removed to the Fever Hospitals. During the height of the epidemic the hospital accommodation was found to be inadequate in all such towns. In London, however, there are no beds set apart in any of the Fever Hospitals for the accommodation of Measles. If the Metropolitan Asylums Board supplied sufficient hospitals for Measles on the same basis as they have provided for the other notifiable diseases, the expense would be enormous. In addition to this, the costs incurred in the payment of notification fees would be more than double what they are now, and in this connection it would have to be remembered that the other sanitary work would be interfered with, owing to the time of the inspectors being taken up during the occurrence of an epidemic. Even were it possible to remove the patients to the hospital, one would never expect in Measles to have the same good results as in the other infectious diseases. The children that contract Measles are generally younger than those who suffer from Scarlet Fever. Most of the deaths last year were children under two years of age, and nearly one-half were infants under one year of age. The objections to removing to Fever Hospital babies under a twelve-month old are obvious. Besides, the disease is infectious long before the rash appears, and days before the disease can be diagnosed with any certainty. Removal to hospital being out of the question, can nothing be done to have the patient isolated at home? In this Borough during 1903 it was found necessary to remove to the Fever Hospitals 87 per cent, of the Diphtheria cases, and 88 per cent. of the Scarlet Fever cases, due to the fact that it was impossible to have them isolated at home. It would therefore be necessary to remove an equivalent percentage of children suffering from Measles if strict isolation would be enforced. With the exception of Diarrhoea there were more deaths from Measles in our Borough last year than any other Zymotic disease. In fact, there were more deaths B 2 20 from it than from Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Croup, and Enteric Fever put together. The number of hospitals required, calculated on this basis, would be enormous. Would the results that one might reasonably expect justify the means 1 The majority of the Medical Officers of Health of the districts where compulsory notification has been tried approve of it, but scarcely any can point to a diminished prevalence of the disease. I maintain, however, that any steps that are taken without compulsory notification are of no use. By notification you certainly receive information where the first cases occur. The inspection and, if possible, isolation, with full instructions and periodic visits to see that these are carried out, would be of some use, if only to warn the parents against pulmonary complications which are so frequently fatal. Sufficient care is not exercised by the parents to prevent these serious complications. These visits would also tend to prevent the spread of the disease, as well as lead to the increased appreciation by the public of the serious nature of the disease. As I am afraid compulsory notification with removal to isolation hospitals would not be justified by the results, the attempt to strictly carry out the other measures mentioned will be treated with ridicule, and tend to bring preventive measures generally into disrepute. Scarlet Fever. 816 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified, of which 719 were removed to the various Fever Hospitals. 156 occurred in the Limehouse District, with 1 death. 144 occurred in the St. George's District, with 3 deaths. 278 occurred in the Mile End District, with 6 deaths. 238 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 8 deaths. The number of notifications is 138 and the number of deaths 8 less than in the preceding year. This reduction has occurred in three out of the four districts, the number of cases being 35 less in the Limehouse District, 30 more in St. George's, 121 less in Mile End, and 12 less in the Whitechapel District. The death-rate for the whole of the Borough was at the rate of .06 per 1,000 of the population, that for the whole of London being .08 per 1,000. 21 Whooping Cough. The number of deaths was 105, or 83 less than in the previous year. 20 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .34 per 1,000 of the population. 25 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .50 per 1,000 of the population. 34 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .29 per 1,000 of the population. 26 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .32 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of the Borough was at the rate of .34 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate throughout London was .35 per 1,000 of the population. Diphtheria. 457 Diphtheria cases were notified during the year, and 401 were removed to the Fever Hospitals. This number is 184 less than in the preceding year. 80 cases occurred in the Limehouse District, with 8 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of 14 per 1,000 of the population. 63 cases occurred in the St. George's District, with 7 deaths, which is equal to a death-rate of 14 per 1,000 of the population. 182 cases occurred in Mile End Old Town, with 26 deaths, which is equal to a death-rate of .23 per 1,000 of the population. 132 cases occurred in the Whitechapel District, of which 17 proved fatal, which is equal to a death-rate of .21 per 1,000 of the population. 58 proved fatal in the whole of the Borough, which is equal to a death-rate of .19 per 1,000 of the population. 12.7 per cent. of the cases proved fatal. The death-rate throughout London was .14 per 1,000. 22 Membranous Croup. Eight cases were notified, and one was removed to the hospital. 2 occurred in the Limehouse District. One proved fatal. 1 occurred in the St. George's District. He recovered. 2 occurred in the Mile End District. One proved fatal. 3 occurred in the Whitechapel District. Two proved fatal. Typhus Fever. One case occurred in the Whitechapel District. The patient recovered. When he was removed to the Fever Hospital it was thought that he was suffering from Enteric Fever, and it was not until he had been several days at that Institution that I was informed that he was really suffering from Typhus Fever. Enteric Fever. 179 cases occurred during the year, of which 146 were removed to the various hospitals. 27 proved fatal, which corresponds to a death-rate of .089 per 1,000. 43 cases occurred in the Limehouse District, and 7 proved fatal, which is equal to a death-rate of .12 per 1,000 of the population. 35 cases occurred in the St. George's District, and 7 proved fatal, which is equal to a death-rate of .14 per 1,000 of the population. 60 cases occurred in Mile End, with 11 deaths, which is equal to a death- rate of .09 per 1,000 of the population. 41 cases occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 2 deaths, which is equal to a death-rate of .02 per 1,000 of the population. 15 per cent. of the cases proved fatal. The death-rate for the whole of London was .08 per 1,000. 23 Erysipelas. 376 cases were notified, and 50 were removed to the various hospitals and infirmaries. 64 occurred in the Limehouse District, with 2 deaths. 73 occurred in the St. George's District, with 5 deaths. 130 occurred in the Mile End District, with 6 deaths. 109 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 4 deaths. The death-rate was .05 per 1,000 of the population. Diarrhoea. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, which includes Epidemic and Zymotic Enteritis; Dysentery, and Dysenteric Diarrhœa; Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhœa, was 272, of which 214 were infants under one year of age. 56 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .96 per 1,000. 76 „ „ St. George's „ „ „ 1.52 „ 98 „ „ Mile End „ „ „ .86 „ 42 „ „ Whitechapel „ „ „ .53 „ The death-rate for the whole of the Borough was at the rate of .90 per 1,000 of the population. Enteritis. The number of deaths from Enteritis, which includes Gastro-Enteritis, MucoEnteritis, and Gastric Catarrh, was 124. Of this number, 94 were children under one year of age. 22 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .38 per 1,000. 23 „ „ St. George's „ „ „ .46 „ 33 „ „ Mile End „ „ „ .29 „ 46 „ „ Whitechapel „ „ „ .58 „ The death-rate for the whole of the Borough was at the rate of .41 per 1,000. 24 Puerperal Fever. Eleven cases of Puerperal Fever occurred, 2 in Limehouse, 3 in St. Georges, 3 in Mile End, and 3 in Whitechapel. Zymotic Diseases. The total deaths from Zymotic Diseases numbered 658. This number corresponds to a death-rate of 2.17 per 1,000 of the population. It includes deaths from Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Croup, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever and Diarrhoea. 139 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 2.40 per 1,000. 162 „ „ St. George's „ „ „ 3.24 „ 224 „ „ Mile End „ „ „ 1.96 „ 133 „ „ Whitechapel „ „ „ 1.68 „ Phthisis. 627 deaths occurred from Phthisis during the year. This corresponds to a death-rate of 2.07 per 1,000 of the population. 123 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 2.12 per 1,000. 122 „ „ St. George's „ „ „ 2.44 „ 189 „ „ Mile End „ „ „ 1.66 „ 193 „ „ Whitechapel „ „ ,, 2.44 „ The death-rate for Phthisis for the whole of London was 1.6 per 1,000. In addition to the deaths from Phthisis there were 195 deaths due to other Tubercular diseases. This corresponds to a death-rate of .64 per 1,000. 52 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .89 per 1,000. 37 „ „ St. George's „ „ „ .74 „ 61 „ „ Mile End „ „ „ .53 „ 45 „ „ Whitechapel „ „ „ .57 „ 25 Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. There were 1,071 deaths due to diseases of Respiratory Organs, which corresponds to a death-rate of 3.54 per 1,000. 198 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 3.41 per 1,000. 207 „ „ St. George's „ „ „ 4.14 „ 367 „ „ Mile End „ „ „ 3.22 „ 299 „ „ Whitechapel „ „ „ 3.77 „ Infantile Mortality. 1,599 infants died under one year of age. This is equal to a death-rate of 141 per 1,000 births. This number is 108 less than in the previous year, when the rate was 150 per 1,000 births. 308 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 165 per 1,000 births. 349 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 170 per 1,000 births. 547 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 122 per 1,000 births. 395 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 138 per 1,000 births. The infantile mortality throughout London was 131 per 1,000 births. It was not therefore much higher in this Borough than in the whole of London. The mortality was less in Limehouse and Mile End than in the previous year, but higher in St. George's and Whitechapel. The Limehouse District had an unenviable reputation for several years of having the highest infantile mortality of any district in London. Last year this was not so, and the rate has been gradually declining since 1898. 26 Table of infantile mortality in the various Districts per 1,000 births, for the years 1899-1903:— Year. Limehouse District. St. Georges. Mile End. Whitechapel District. Total for the whole district. 1899 216 199 161 147 174 1900 227 141 166 140 166 1901 211 185 150 140 165 1902 197 160 163 117 155 1903 165 170 122 138 141 I have no doubt that the wet and cool summer was the cause in some districts of fewer number of deaths from Diarrhœa, and thus was the direct cause of the lowered infantile mortality. In this Borough this was not the case, as the number of deaths of infants under one year of age from Diarrhœa was greater than in the previous year. In 1903 the number of deaths under one year of age from Diarrhoea and Enteritis was 308, and in 1902 the number was 248. The number was greater in each district with the exception of the Whitechapel District, which was five less than in the previous year. The decrease was more marked in the Limehouse District than in any other part of the Borough, and the decline started from the year 1900. During that year the late Limehouse Board caused to be distributed pamphlets giving advice to mothers how to properly rear and bring up children. Hundreds of these pamphlets have since been distributed in this part of the Borough, through the various parish officials, district visitors, nurses, etc. It is a significant fact that since this course has been adopted, there have been fewer deaths of infants under one year of age. Old Age. 202 deaths were due to Old Age. This corresponds to a death-rate of .66 per 1,000 of the population. 50 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .86 per 1,000. 22 „ „ St. George's „ „ „ .44 „ 84 „ „ Mile End „ „ „ .73 „ 46 „ „ Whitechapel „ „ „ .58 „ 27 Alcoholism. The number of deaths registered and ascribed to the consumption of Alcohol was 76, as compared with 102 in 1902 and 100 in 1901. It will be thus seen that there is a marked reduction during the last year. It may perhaps be argued that this improvement is due to the large and increasing number of Jews in the district, who are undoubtedly more moderate in this particular generally than the native population. I do not think this explanation is conclusive, as there is less drunkenness in recent years throughout the whole country, and the same reduction is manifest in other districts where the number of Jews is negligeable. I am of opinion that there is a wave of temperance passing over the land. Cancer. The number of deaths from Cancer increased from 201 in 1902 to 223 in 1903. This dread disease is, I believe, definitely on the increase in this district as well as in nearly all other districts. It is not quite fair to compare the number of deaths from this disease in recent years to what it was in former years, as at that time the disease, especially where it attacked internal organs, was incorrectly diagnosed and the deaths were ascribed to some other diseases. It is, however, perfectly just to compare the number of deaths from year to year in recent times as the means at our disposal for obtaining an accurate diagnosis have not appreciably increased from that period. When this test is applied, the same progressive increase is continually being manifested. Notifiable Diseases. 1,866 cases of infectious disease were notified. Of this number, 499 only were treated at home or died before they could be removed to the various hospitals. 265 occurred in the Limehouse District. 232 occurred in the St. George's District. 461 occurred in the Mile End District. 409 occurred in the Whitechapel District. 28 The number of notifiable diseases is less in each district than it has ever been since the 1891 Act came into force. For the sake of comparison with the previous years 1 give below two tables giving the number in the previous years. In the second table, even by excluding Small Pox it will be seen that the decrease is satisfactory.

Excluding Small Pox, it will be seen that the gradual decline is very marked and highly satisfactory, as is evident from the following table:—• Table of Notifiable Diseases, but excluding Small Pox.

It frequently happens that, when a patient convalescent from Scarlet Fever has been discharged from hospital, further cases are later notified from among those brought into contact with him after his return home. Such cases, associated in. this manner with the return home of the patient, are termed "return" cases. During the year 1903, in this district, 15 primary cases of Scarlet Fever gave rise to 24 such " return " cases. Return cases occur, but in much less marked degree, in connection with Diphtheria. During the same period two primary cases of Diphtheria gave rise to two return cases. They occurred as follows:— Address. Date of discharge Date of removal of subsequent cases. Total number of return cases. 10, Taylor's Place January 9th January 16 th 1 3, Maidman Street January 7th January 22nd 1 7, Dongola Street January 23rd January 23rd 1 20, Salter Street January 5th February 3rd 1 6, Ropner Place January 23rd February 9th 1 54, Portland Street February 4th February 11th 1 438, Commercial Road February 18th February 28th 1 60, Jubilee Street April 2nd April 27th 1 33, Kinder Street April 22nd May 6th 6, Pixley Street May 6th (1) May 11th (2) May 12th (3) May 15th (4) May 19th (5) June 9th 5 6, White's Gardens June 22nd July 18 th 1 13, Lee Street July 24th (1) July 30th (2) August 1st 2 50, London Street July 31st (1) August 7th (2) September 26th 2 43, Gold Street August 21st (1) August 29th (2) September 7th (3) December 10th 3 199, Salmon Lane October 2nd October 9th 1 35, Bewley Buildings December 18th December 23rd 1 16, Rowsell Street November 14th November 19 th 2 30 It will be observed that the return case is often not removed to the hospital until after the expiration of the incubation period. It must, however, be remembered that the doctor is frequently not called to see the patient for several days. The rash may have possibly disappeared by that time, and the medical man is not prepared to certify it for several days—in fact, not until the child has started peeling. Towards the end of the year I reported to the Public Health Committee the return cases that had occurred during the latter part of the year. Some of these were "peeling" when they were discharged from the hospital. As a result, the Borough Council called the attention of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to these cases. The Council also informed the Board that these cases had been discharged while in an infectious condition. Whether the infective material was conveyed in the desquamating skin, was not so important as the fact that the discharged patients were the cause of propagating the disease among other children. The reply was that the matter had received the very careful consideration of a Special Sub-Committee of the Board, who had received a report thereon by the Medical Investigator, and they could find no evidence to substantiate our allegation, that any of the patients were discharged from hospital at too early a period. The letter further stated the procedure adopted before the patients are discharged, which is as follows:— "When the opinion is expressed by the Medical Superintendent that a patient is fit to be discharged, a notice is sent to the friends, of the exact day and hour, two days later, when a patient will be discharged. Before the actual discharge takes place, the patient, after special preparation, is again finally examined by the Medical Officer in charge, with a view of determining whether such discharge should be effected." Though the Council had enclosed with their letter a copy of my report on the cases, the Board unfortunately did not forward a copy of their Medical Investigator's report with their reply. My chief object in reporting the matter to the Committee was that the Metropolitan Asylums Board might be asked to cause a fair and unbiassed inquiry to be made as to the injurious agency that is responsible for these cases, and to have it remedied if possible. The different incidence in these two diseases—Scarlet Fever and Diphtheriais possibly partly explained on the grounds that, whereas most, if not all, of the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board discharge their Diphtheria patients "culture free," such a procedure is at present impossible in the case of Scarlet Fever, owing to the fact that, whereas the bacillus of Diphtheria is generally acknowledged and easily recognised, we are at present in ignorance of the microbe of Scarlet Fever. 31 It is true that organisms have been isolated and described as such specific microbes, notably the Streptococcus Scarlatinæ (Klein), and the Diplococcus Scarlatinæ (Class). These have not by any means met with general recognition and assent. At the present time, return cases in Scarlet Fever have been ascribed to and associated with:— 1. Coincidence. This is, of course, possible. It is, however, improbable that so many should occur six weeks or two months after the removal to hospital of the first patient and within such a short time of his returning home. 2. Concealment of infectious materials by parents and guardians. It is notorious that people most readily give up bedding, personal clothing, especially if old or worn, books and curtains to the Sanitary Authority—yet toys and Sunday clothes axe very often concealed and thereby escape disinfection—to be worn and used again on the patients being discharged from hospital. This does not apply so much to our own district, as my instructions to the disinfectors are that they must take away all articles of clothing to be disinfected. If any particular article is refused they are at once to report the matter to me. It is therefore not left to the people themselves as to what shall be disinfected or not. The patients are usually removed to the hospital at the onset of the disease and during the acute stage. Under these circumstances, as the children are very ill, no toys are bought for them. If any are provided they are cheap, and no difficulty is ever encountered in having them destroyed. The poorer people are not often blessed with books of their own. They generally borrow from the Public Libraries. The latter are never returned to the Libraries, but are destroyed by us. It is curious that, in most of the return cases, I was informed by the parents, that the children had no Sunday clothes at the time they were taken ill. New clothes were bought a few days before their return home and were worn for the first day on leaving the hospital. 3. Accidents and irregularities in discharging patients from hospital. (a) Inadequate accommodation for discharging patients, so that the patient has to be dressed in his clean clothes in a room adjacent to the ward in which other patients are being treated. 32 (b) Insufficient nursing staff, so that the same nurse receives the patient from the ward in his infectious clothes, and later carries him in his clean clothes to his parents. (c) Clandestine conveyance of small toys or ornaments by patients from ward which have not been previously disinfected. (d) Examination of patient after he has received his final bath by the Medical Officer, who is wearing infectious clothes and no overall. 4. Peeling of skin and too short a period of detention in hospital. It is true that there have been return cases even when the primary case had long ceased to peel. It is also true that many cases are discharged peeling profusely, and have been followed by no ill results. The general opinion at present among Medical Officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board is that the peeling is not infective; but this is difficult to reconcile with the assertion of Class, who maintains that he has found the special organism in the desquamating cuticle. Class's observations have, however, not been confirmed in Europe, and are not accepted here by competent authorities. Apart from this, the clinical experience of practically all general practitioners is in favour of the patients being considered infectious, when they are "peeling." 5. Presence of serous or purulent discharge from nose, earS, mouth, even though apparently insignificant and of mild degree. Sore nose, eczematous condition of face or mouth. The discharges in the above are undoubtedly infective agents. Such discharge may or may not be present when the patient is removed from the hospital, but may occur later, having been induced by a cold caught on the way home, e.g., on the top of a bus or by the warm bath given in the institution shortly before the patient's discharge. In these cases it is supposed that the patient coming from an infectious ward has present in his mouth, throat, and nasal passages, the specific organism which, 33 when the patient "catches cold," is shed on to the clothes, utensils and handkerchiefs. The organism, morever, finds in the discharge the food and moisture requisite for growth and propagation. Klein, Gordon, and Moser claim to have found the Streptococcus Scarlatinae present in specimens of these discharges examined by them. 6. Bronchitis; Coryza; Faucitis (sore throat). Cervical Adenits (enlarged glands in neck). Any of these may be present at or soon after the patient's discharge from hospital. 7. Too long a period of detention in hospital. Some authorities maintain, apparently with very good reason, that rhinorrhea and otorrhea are propagable in a ward, and may be communicated not only to patients in immediate contiguity with the one affected, but to others in remote parts of the ward. Thus it frequently happens that a patient in all other respects convalescent contracts a nasal, aural or buccal discharge shortly before he is ready for home, by sitting down at meals, fondling, playing with or otherwise being brought into contact with a patient already so suffering. This possibility and distinction is recognized by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, but is, so far as I know, only acted on in the conveyance of convalescent patients to the Northern Convalescent Hospital at Winchmore Hill. The clean and unclean patients (having rhinorrhea, otorrhea or stomatorrhea) are conveyed in separate vehicles. These exudates may later prove the infecting agents in causing return cases. The common-sense inference, however, is the necessity not so much for shortening detention in hospital as for immediately isolating any case of Scarlet Fever associated with a serous or purulent discharge from nose, mouth or ear, apart from other patients. The measures, preventive and ameliorating, adopted and suggested include:— 1. A warm bath the night before discharge from hospital, sleeping that night in an isolation room, and conveyance home on the subsequent day in a cab or ambulance, thus obviating as far as possible the danger of "catching cold" on the way. C 34 2. Precautions after reception home. (a) Modified isolation from rest of family who are presumed to be susceptible— chiefly the younger members—thus, sleeping apart, avoidance of kissing, fondling and playing in common; the use of separate utensils. This would be almost impossible in our district in the majority of cases. (b) The issue of a special warning card on the day of the patient's dismissal from hospital, advising the parents to consult a medical man on the appearance of sore nose, rhinorrhea, otorrhea, coryza, bronchitis, etc., within a certain time after return home. (c) Notification of dismissal from hospital of all cases to be sent to the Sanitary Authorities. (This has lately been done by the Asylums Board.) 3. Patients convalescent from Diphtheria to be discharged "culture free." 4. Patients recovering from Scarlet Fever should not be sent home if they have discharge from the nose, throat, etc., or are peeling. 5. Isolation within isolation. In this method each case is removed to hospital, and there isolated, so that the hospital is in reality a large aggregation of isolation rooms containing single beds. A modification of this method is already being carried out in France with admirable results. (Article on "Measles" in "Twentieth Century Practice of Medicine.") 6. In the absence of the measure last indicated, the treatment in wards of the "clean" cases alone; the "unclean" being isolated and detained in hospital in single-bedded isolation rooms. The chief objection to 5 and 6 is that of expense. 7. The re-notification and re-admission of the primary case as soon as one case is notified. The need for inquiry is emphasised by the fact that "return cases" occur frequently in all the other Metropolitan Districts. They are the cause of a great deal of anxiety and expense.

The number of bodies deposited in the Mortuary during the year was 710. 608 bodies were removed by the Coroner's order; 43 by the Police, 41 by the Relieving Officers; 4 at the request of deceased's friends, and 14 by my own orders. 20 bodies were those of persons that had died from an infectious disease, and were therefore placed in the Infectious Mortuary. 642 Inquests were held in the Coroner's Court, two being adjourned from the London Hospital. 77 Post-mortem examinations were performed. Army Blankets. A large number of army blankets, which had been condemned in South Africa, had got on to the market, and one consignment went to a very respectable firm in the City of London. These were purchased and sent to the training ship Cornwall, where, shortly after these coverings were brought into use, an outbreak of Enteric Fever occurred. After investigation, the blankets were suspected to be the source of infection. They were bacteriologically examined, and some found to be in a very dirty condition and containing Enteric Fever bacilli. About 50,000 were delivered to Mr. Myers, of 97, Wentworth Street, as agent for a Mr. Cohen, of Cape Town, and were stored in Assam Street. On receipt of the above information I closed the warehouse. The premises were fumigated, and all the blankets disinfected by steam. Destroying them would have been more satisfactory, and I wired to the War Office, stating the circumstances and suggesting the advisability of having the blankets destroyed, but at their expense. The reply was so vague and unsatisfactory, that I was unable to act on their communication, 37 The Local Government Board also wrote on May 25th, giving the above information, and suggesting that the blankets should be either disinfected or destroyed. The Town Clerk replied to this letter, and stated that the Council would be pleased to avail themselves of the Board's suggestion to destroy the blankets if the Board would indemnify the Council against the cost of destruction of the blankets and the compensation, which would have to be paid to the owners, in accordance with the provisions of Section 60, Sub-sec. 5 of the Public Health Act, 1891. The Local Government Board replied on June 3rd that they had no power to give the indemnity suggested and no funds out of which they could pay the compensation. The majority of the blankets, that had been sold, had been bought by a firm in the City, who had afterwards sold them to their several customers in various parts of the country. In addition to these, I found that Mr. Myers had sold direct to persons in various parts of London, as well as to Nottingham, Clacton, and Montreal. I communicated the facts to the respective Medical Officers of Health, who took prompt action in tracing the blankets and having them disinfected. Thty were disinfected at a time when the disinfecting apparatus was not engaged in disinfecting ordinary infected clothing, and also during the men's overtime. Fortunately there was very little infectious disease in the Borough at the time. The number of articles disinfected was as follows : — 51,250 blankets. 341 bundles which contained blankets which had been torn up in four quarters. 131 sacks ditto 28J bales ditto 1,575 ground sheets. 350 bundles ground sheets (pieces). 61 tents. 13 sacks leather, stirrups, etc. 1 sack old clothes. The ground sheets could not be disinfected by steam, and had to be carefully washed with a solution of carbolic acid. It took nearly six months to complete the disinfection. The amount of the bill that was presented to the War Office and was paid to the Borough Council was £498 5s. lOd. 38 Port of Londong Inquiry. An Inspector from the Local Government Board on April 24th and May 18th held an Inquiry as to whether the Port Sanitary Authority's jurisdiction in the examination of food should be extended to include food landed on Wharves. The Inquiry was the result of a complaint from the London and India Docks Company, who stated that the examination of food landed at the Docks was of a more severe character than that of food landed at the Wharves. From evidence given at the Inquiry it appeared that the Stepney Borough Council was the only Metropolitan Borough that had appointed a special Inspector to devote his whole time to the examination of food landed at the Wharves. It transpired that no systematic inspection by an officer appointed exclusively for this purpose was made on any Wharves belonging to other Metropolitan Districts. In September the Local Government Board reported that they had carefully considered the Inspector's Rejoort and the evidence placed before him at the Inquiry. They had also taken into consideration the proceedings in Parliament during the past Session with reference to the proposals in the Port of London Bill; and they had decided, having regard to all the circumstances, not to accede to the application of the Dock Company at the present time. The Board had, however, communicated with the Councils of certain Metropolitan Boroughs with regard to the examination of foodstuffs landed at Wharves abutting on the River Thames. i With regard to the latter paragraph, as the Stepney Borough Council was not one of the Boroughs to which the Board had sent a communication, it may be taken for granted that the Local Government Board considered the examination of food landed on Wharves in this Borough to be satisfactory. Unsound Food. In December, 1902, I reported to the Public Health Committee that I had detained 118 cases of tinned Salmon, belonging to Messrs. Gibbons & Co., Bristol, on Thorpes Wharf. To all appearance the contents of the tins when opened were alright, but they contained quantities of tin and slight traces of lead. I communicated with the owners, and they had samples analysed by their own analyst. This analyst's certificate stated that tin was present in the Salmon, but at the same time it was quite fit for human food. The Committee instructed me to seize the consignment and to bring it before a Magistrate to be condemned. I notified the owners of my intention of applying to the Magistrate on a certain date which would allow them to be represented at the Court. They did not appear, but wrote a private letter to the Magistrate, and as a result he appointed January 10th for the hearing, and as the case was likely to last a long time he decided to give a whole afternoon 39 to hear it. Inasmuch as there was likely to be a conflict of opinion as to the analysis ,he suggested that a few tins should be supplied to an independent analyst for analysis. This was accordingly done. The result of this independent analysis was as follows : — No. 1 contained 6-93 grains of tin per lb. No. 2 contained 4 41 grains of tin per lb. No. 3 contained 3 78 grains of tin per lb. No. 4 contained 3 01 grains of tin per lb. No trace of lead was found in any of the four samples. In his remarks the firm's analyst stated that " a not inconsiderable number of specks of solder was found interspersed with the Salmon. These specks had evidently dropped through the vent-liole, while the latter was being soldered up. As solder is a mixture of lead and tin, it was of course of the highest importance not to include any of the metallic matter in question in the sample of salmon itself. The pieces of salmon used for analysis were carefully examined, and the visible pieces of solder removed. The pieces, in any case, would not be eaten by the purchaser, and if accidentally swallowed would probably not do any harm. If included in the analysis they would obviously mislead the analyst as to the condition of the article. Both samples are perfectly free from lead. Both, however, contain a small trace of tin. There is no tinned meat to be found in commerce which on careful analysis does not show minute traces of dissolved tin." As only one or two samples had been found to contain lead, and the independent analyst found none, it is evident that we were as careful to pick out the small specks of solder as the firm's analyst had been. I disagreed with his deductions. In the first place, I do not believe these specks of solder are ever looked for by the public and afterwards thrown away. In fact, the specks are so small that it requires very careful examination to detect them at all. In the second place, I hold that the lead, even in the small trace that is found in solder (which is an alloy of tin and lead), would have been so acted upon by the gastric and intestinal juices as to be rendered absorbable. Whether it would be absorbed or not, metallic tin and lead would be liable to act as an irritant to the delicate mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines. On January 8th, Messrs. Gibbons surrendered the whole consignment as trade refuse, and signed a document that they would pay all expenses incurred in their destruction. It was a pity in one sense that the case did not go on, as I believe this would have been the first time that the question of the wholesomeness of canned goods 40 due fco the presence of tin had ever been questioned. It raised really a very important point. The appearance of the tins and of the contents was such as would pass muster by the most expert examiners. Chemical examination would not have been made if we had not received information that the tins had been on the wharves for several years. It is therefore possible that canned goods may be sold after the most careful examination, and yet contain tin and lead in such large proportions as to be quite unfit for human consumption. Cocoa Beans.—On March 2nd I received a communication from the owners of the Metropolitan Wharf stating that Dr. Williams, the Medical Officer of Health of the Port, of London, had seized three parcels of Cocoa Beans, which consisted of 386 bags. It was admitted that some of the beans were good and some were bad. In their communication to me they requested permission to have the consignment landed at their wharf for the pur-pose of sorting the sound from the unsound beans. The reason given was that it would be very much cheaper than to land it somewhere in the Docks, the wharf not being so heavy as the Dock dues. The sorting was to be done under my supervision and to my satisfaction. My reply was that I had no objection, provided Dr. Williams's consent in writing be first obtained. This was done, and the consignment was released by him on the understanding that it should be garbled under my supervision. I visited the wharf by appointment on March 9th to superintend the process of sorting. I found that the beans in 277 bags were sound, and I at once released them. In the remaining 109 bags there was a large percentage of unsound beans. Unfortunately the brokers who represented the owners denied that any of the cocoa was bad, and said that no garbling was required. I refused to release the remaining 109 bags until they had carried out their part of the agreement to sort out the unsound beans and to have them destroyed. The brokers admitted that some of the beans were mouldy, yet these even were quite fit for human food. Later, the brokers produced a certificate from an analyst which stated that 6 J per cent, of the beans were mouldy and 1J per cent, were rotten. They now claimed that it was impossible to sort the beans. This, of course, was absurd, and besides, I called their attention to the fact that I only allowed them to be landed in this district for the purpose of being sorted. Under the circumstances, I would not release them unless their part of the agreement had been carried out or at the request of the Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. The alternative would be to have the matter decided at the Police Court. I informed the owners that I would apply at the Thames Police Court on a certain day to have an order to destroy as unfit or food the contents of the 109 bags. Before the date, however, the owners consented to garble the beans. This was done under my supervision, and the unsound beans were afterwards destroyed. 41 Police Court Piioceedings. On June 8th, Mrs. Hannah Brown, of 151, White Horse Street, was fined £3 and 23s. costs for exposing for sale 21 pieces of salt pork which were unsound and unfit for human food. On October 15th, Mi-. Joseph Beitel, a baker, of 48, Brick Lane, was summoned for having deposited in his bakehouse 225 eggs which were unsound and unwholesome and which were intended for preparation for human food. The defendant did not appear at the Court, and his representative informed the Magistrate that he had absconded to Germany. The summons was adjourned sine die, and a warrant was afterwards issued for his arrest. On October 20th, Mr. Harry Mead, a butcher, of 16, Edinburgh Road, was fined £10 and £3 3s. costs for exposing for sale on a stall in White Horse Street a quantity of meat weighing 133 lb., which was unfit for human food. On November 2nd, Mr. Solomon Nadur, of 28, Watney Street, was summoned for obstruction in connection with the seizure of 10 boxes of condensed milk on his premises. The owner returned the goods to the wholesale dealer after they had been seized, and after the Inspector had temporarily left the premises. The summons was dismissed because the Magistrate said he was not satisfied that the defendant knew what the Inspector meant when he said that he had seized the goods. The Medical Officer of Health for the district where the goods had been returned to was at once communicated with, and as a result a seizure was made by him on Harvey & Foster's (Fells) premises. Mr. Fells was subsequently fined £20 and £5 5s. costs at the West Ham Police Court. On November 17th, Mr. S. Tabatchnik, a wholesale and retail egg merchant, of 39, Fairclougli Street, was sent to prison for one month with hard labour without the option of a fine, for having deposited on his premises 6,749 eggs which were in an unsound and unwholesome condition. In addition to the bad eggs, there were on the premises only 1,759 good ones. On November 26th, Mrs. Betsy Jacobs, of 115, Old Castle Street, was fined £2 and 23s. costs for exposing for sale on a stall in Wentworth Street a quantity of rotten plums, grapes and apples. Seizures were also made on the premises of a pork butcher, of Watney Street; a beef butcher of Watney Street; a quantity of eggs on a stall in Wentworth Street. The articles seized were taken before the Magistrate and an order made to have them destroyed. The Public Health Committee decided not to take proceedings but to severely caution the owners. 42 A large quantity of unsound food was surrendered, the greater part being at the wharves. This was done voluntarily by the owners after their attention had been called to its condition by us. It is certain that a portion would have found its way into the market if the Inspector whose duty it is to inspect the wharves did not make systematic inspection of the wharves. Though in most cases the owners promptly surrender the unsound goods when requested to do so, others are inclined to refuse, and it is only afer it has been conclusively proved to them that they are not fit for human consumption, that they are willing to do so. The goods are removed and destroyed by us at the owners' expense.

In the Sanitary Inspectors' Report Table will be seen the amount of work done by each Inspector and the nature thereof. 26,025 houses were inspected during the year, 11,498 being the result of houseto-house inspection. 18,967 notices were served during the year for the abatement of various nuisances. In addition to these notices numerous letters were written to the owners urging them to proceed with the necessary work without further delay. 214 summonses were taken out at the Thames and Worship Street Police Courts. 89 were for offences under the Food and Drugs Act, 117 under the Public Health (London) Act and the bye-laws relating thereto, 3 under the Dairies and Cowsheds Order, and 1 under the London County Council General Powers Bill, 1902; 5 were for having unsound food for sale. Of these, 4 only were dismissed, but costs were not allowed to defendants in a single case. 3,715 houses and 401 workshops were cleansed as a result of notices served on the owners. 7,788 drains were tested and 4,245 were either constructed or re-constructed, cleansed or trapped. 425 new soilpipes were fixed. 6,375 water-closets were either renewed, cleansed or repaired as the result of notices served, 1,571 sanitary dust receptacles, 40 manure receptacles were provided, and 816 offensive accumulations were removed from the rear of dwelling-houses. 100 smoke nuisances were abated, and in 6 cases Police Court proceedings had to be taken against the persons causing the nuisance. 1,422 nuisances arising from overcrowding were abated. 1,343 occurring in dwellings and 79 in workshops. The nuisance was abated after the service of the statutory notice in all cases with the exception of 22, when Police Court proceedings had to be taken. 46 121 underground rooms were found to be illegally occupied, and proceedings had to be taken in 11 cases before the tenants were ejected. The number of milkshops that were registered at the end of the year was 1,000. These were frequently visited during the year. The majority, of course, are small general shops, and only sell a few pints of milk a day. Magistrates' orders were obtained to close nine premises which were unfit for human occupation. The total fines and costs amounted to £561 19s. 6d. Police Court Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act.

The number of boats inspected in 1903 was 56, and the condition of the boats and their occupants as regards the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations wa3 very good. Infringements of the Acts and Regulations were discovered as follows, viz.: — (a) Registration Nil. (b) Notification of change of Master Nil. (c) Certificates Nil. (d) Marking 1 (e) Overcrowding Nil. (f) Separation of the Sexes Nil. (g) Cleanliness Nil. (h) Ventilation Nil. (i) Painting 7 (U) Provision of water cask 1 (k) Removal of bilge water Nil. (I) Notification of infectious diseases Nil. (m) Refusing admittance to Inspector Nil. No legal proceedings were taken in respect of the infringements above mentioned. 56 In the case of infringement, notice was sent to the owner of the boat requiring him to remedy the cause of complaint, and to forward to this Borough within fC sjDecified period a certificate signed by some duly appointed Inspector of Canal Boats that the same had been done, and such certificate was afterwards received. No case of infectious disease occurred, and no boat was detained for cleansing. The number of boats on the Register on the 31st December, 1903, was 69. One boat was registered in 1903. Houses Let in Lodgings. There were at the end of the year 2,649 houses registered as houses let in lodgings. Two special inspectors devote their whole time to the administration of the bye-laws that apply to these houses. All other Inspectors, except the four Inspectors in the St. George's District, have nothing to do with registered houses. In St. George's the districts are so small and compact that here it was thought advisable to allow the registered houses to be under the supervision of the respective Inspectors. The two special Inspectors made 8,802 visits during the year, and served 2,096 notices for the abatement of nuisances. Overcrowding was abated in 613 tenements. Two appeal cases were decided in the High Court. In the first the Council were successful, but in the second they were unsuccessful. As both cases are important, I give below a fairly full account of the proceedings in both, and more especially of the second. (1) FILER'S CASE. This case was tried at the Thames Police Court. The defendant did not, as landlord of No. 26, Eastfield Street, supply the information necessary for the registration of such house, according to the bye-laws. He was fined Is. and 23s. costs. The premises were a two-storied dwelling-house having the first floor and ground floor let separately to two families, each with separate sanitary arrangements. There was a common passage from the front door to the foot of the staircase, which was used 57 by both the tenants, but the tenant of the first floor was alone entitled to use the staircase. There was no door of division between the tenements, but the door of every room had a lock and key. The premises were rated in one assessment in Mr. Filer's name at the sum of £13 per annum, and the landlord compounded for the said rate. It was contended by us that it was a house which was let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family within the meaning of the said bye-laws. It was contended on behalf of the defendant that the ground floor and the first floor were distinct houses or tenements, each separately occupied by one family, and were within the decision of the High Court of Justice—Weatheritt v. Canlly—and that therefore the bye-laws did not apply. The appeal was dismissed, and the Counsel who represented the Borough was not even called upon to reply. (2) GALINSKY'S CASE. Mrs. Galinsky, the owner of 166, Stepney Green, was summoned for failing to comply with Bye-law 14, which compels the owners to cleanse the premises at least once a year. The case was dismissed by Mr. Mead at the Thames Police Court. In stating his case for the High Court Mr. Mead said : — " 1 am of opinion that so much of the first clause of bye-law 14 as requires the annual cleansing by the landlord is invalid on the following grounds:—(a) Being ultra vires. (b) Being repugnant to the laws of England, (c) Being repugnant to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (d) Being unreasonable. I therefore dismiss the summons. " Ground A. I consider that section 94 (d and e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, did not empower the Borough Council to cast an obligation upon a ' landlord ' which did not already exist at common law or by statute, but merely entitled them to regulate the duties of persons already responsible by requiring, e.g., periodical performances. So far as (e) of the above section is concerned, I think that ' stated times' mean ' stated intervals,' and not a particular week in the year. The form of section 1 (3) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (1 Ed. 7, c. 22), fortifies me in my opinion. ' All outside walls shall be limewashed once at least every fourteen months, to date from the time they were last limewashed.' (B) The bye- law is repugnant to the laws of England because, in the absence of express covenants, there is no obligation upon a reversioner even to repair, much less to cleanse, any premises which have been let to a tenant for any term, at any 58 rate unless the state of the premises in consequence of dirt or non-repair is a nuisance of which he has had notice, and it was in his power to abate the nuisance by putting an end. to the tenancy. None of these conditions are appended to the bye-law. (C) Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Public Health Act, 1875, the following state of things must exist before any obligation additional to the common law can be cast upon the owner (the equivalent of the landlord under the bye-laws): — (1) A nuisance injurious to health, and (2) (a) Inability to find the person by whose act, default or sufferance the nuisance exists; or (b) structural defect the cause of the nuisance. Any legislation attempted beyond this is therefore repugnant to the Public Health Statute. " (D) The bye-law is unreasonable because (1) the code of which it forms a part is inconsistent. A concurrent liability to cleanse an exclusive staircase (Bye-law 11) is placed upon the lodger and to cleanse a common staircase upon the keeper (Bylaw 13), yet in the case of the lodger's own room, which is the most private part of the house, the landlord is exclusively liable. As an illustration of the absurdity of this arrangement, if a lodger, in removing filth under Bye-law 10, spill it upon his staircase, he as well as the landlord can be prosecuted for failing to cleanse, but if the mess which the lodger may cause is in his private room he can call upon the landlord to perform the office, and prosecute him under the bye-laws if he fail. (2) Even if the bye-law would be otherwise good in making the landlord responsible, it is unreasonable because it does not cast a primary or at least a concurrent liability upon the lodger to cleanse his rooms, and also relieves the keeper, who has more immediate control of the premises than the landlord, from all liability in the matter either concurrent or prior so far as the rooms and exclusive staircases, etc., are concerned. (3) The position of the landlord is such that the bye-law generally is unreasonable. The necessity for cleansing a room arises from hour to hour and day to day, and it would be impossible for a landlord to exercise such vigilance and control that, whenever a lodger's private room requires cleansing, he must be on the spot to perform the operation. He may derive no profit whatever from the lodging-house business, in fact, the house may be so let against his wishes. In the absence of express covenants he has no right beyond that which the bye-law may confer to enter the premises, and in order to comply with the bye-law he must first arrange with the keeper to enter the house, and secondly with the lodger to enter the room. The performance by a stranger of the delicate task of cleansing another person's furnished room would inevitably lead to friction and difficulty, especially as the landlord has no liability or even right with regard to the furniture. It is impossible to cleanse a room effectually unless the furniture forms part of the same operation. 59 " (4) The requirement of the bye-law that the landlord shall cause every part of the premises to be cleansed at such other times than the first week in April as the condition thereof may render necessary renders the cleansing in the first week of April superfluous, and on that ground the bye-law is unreasonable. " (5) The bye-law, in limiting the annual cleansing to a single week in the year, is unreasonable. The definition of lodging-house is too wide, as it comprises not only overcrowded houses in squalid streets, but also comparatively highly rented houses which are occupied by members of more than one family, e.g., a clergy-house, or a house where a paying guest is received, so that in the Borough of Stepney the houses unaffected would be extremely few. The difficulty of securing sufficient labour to cleanse thoroughly nearly every house in the Borough at the same time would be almost insurmountable, and the cost would be enormous, especially when under the same bye-law the whole of the premises must be limewashed within the same week as that in which the cleansing must be done. The week selected too may be one of the most inconvenient in the whole year, as it may comprise not only Good Friday, but also Easter Monday and the subsequent holidays." JUDGMENT. The Lord Chief Justice : Nobody can have listened to this argument without being struck with the extreme importance of the point that has been raised, and I am very glad (although we have had two cases) that we have had the advantage of having it thoroughly argued by the Counsel upon each side. In consequence of some observations that have been made, holding, as I hold, that the bye-laws in both of these cases must be held to be unreasonable, I want expressly to point out that we are not interfering with the discretion of the local authorities to the extent to which it has been suggested by those who supported the bye-laws. In the first place, I recognise that on practical questions, where a power is given to a public authority to make bye-laws within the ambit of the power that is given to them, as, for instance, in this case, for cleansing and limewashing at stated times of the premises, that their discretion ought not to be lightly interfered with, especially where bye-laws have been sanctioned by a public department, and particular duties and times and periods have been enforced. It is only where we clearly see that some legal principle is interfered with that we ought to hold that bye-laws are unreasonable, and, therefore, I am now quite sure that we are all agreed as to all the grounds upon which we think these bye-laws are unreasonable. I also agree, as the Lord Chief Justice (Lord Russell) pointed out in Kruse v. Johnson, that these byelaws are not to be set aside or upheld except upon strong grounds; it is not to be assumed against them that they would be construed unreasonably. Now, taking the case that was first argued, the Stepney case, the objection that I take to this bye-law and the ground upon which I think bye-law 14 is unreasonable is that it includes or may include a class of people who are not legally responsible and not 60 morally responsible, without safeguarding them before they can be made liable for a criminal offence. The words are: " The landlord of a lodging-house shall in the first week of the month of April in every year, cause every part of the premises to be cleansed, and Bye-law 19 says : " Any person who shall offend against anv of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of £5." Now, the word " cause " is, of course, the word that gives rise to the difficulty. If " cause " could be construed to mean " take reasonable steps,'' that is to say, make a contract with his tenants, or something of that kind, the same difficulty would not have arisen; but I think very properly in the interests of sanitation and in the interest of the good working of this kind of Act, " cause " does not mean merely "take steps," but "shall see that the thing is done." Therefore, we have the byelaw providing that the person upon whom the duty is cast has to see the thing is done. Now I turn back to " landlord," and I find that " landlord " in these bye-laws includes in relation to a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, the person (whatever may be the nature or extent of his interest in the premises, and whether he resides on the premises or not) who receives or is entitled to receive the rack-rent of a lodging-house. Now, I do not read the definition of " keeper " from these bye-laws for the moment, because I quite agree that there would be less objection to the bye-law if it were confined to a person who really had what I may call the personal management of the house. Therefore I come to the conclusion that the bye-law in both cases is bad, because it does not provide for the person who is going to be made subject to the charge receiving notice in cases in which, under many circumstances, he may not, so to speak, have, what I may call, the ordinary means of knowing whether or not the law has been fulfilled. I now come to that part of the case which has given us more difficulty—or at any rate given me more difficulty-—and upon which I am not quite sure that we are all agreed. Speaking for myself and myself only, I should not have been disposed to interfere with this finding on the ground that the period taken was the end of the first week in April. The Statute says that they are to make bye-laws for cleansing and limewasliing the premises at- stated times. Undoubtedly I think that does mean fix dates when about it should be done. I trust that if the bye-laws come to be reconsidered, the objections, which seem to me to be very strong objections, to the taking of this particular period, which my brother Wills has pointed out in the course of the argument, will be considered. I can well imagine that a week at the end of April or a fortnight at the beginning of May, or anything of that kind, would remove all those objections; but why I should not have been disposed to interfere on that ground is, that that does not seem to me exactly one of the things in which the knowledge and experience of the Local Authority, who have to fix a stated time, ought to prevail, unless some, what I may call very grave objections, so serious as to amount to an objection in law, or some strong unreasonableness, in fact, prevails. While I have been very much impressed by the 61 suggestion that the end of the first week in April will be very often a difficult time for it to be done, there may be other considerations in connection with the class of lodging-house or the class of people who inhabit these lodging-houses, of which I do not know, which may be counterbalanced by these considerations. Had it rested with me, I should not have been disposed to hold, and I do not hold, that the bye-law is bad because of that particular week being taken, but, for the reasons which I have stated, which are, in my opinion, more substantial, with regard to the question of no notice being given to an absent landlord who may be under no legal or moral responsibility to see the Act carried out as between himself and the real person in occupation or tenancy of the premises, I think this bye-law must be held to be unreasonable, and that being so, the first acquittal must be supported, that is to say, the first appeal must be dismissed and the second appeal must be allowed. Mr. Justice Wills: I am of the same opinion, and I desire to adopt as part of my Judgment everything which my Lord has said, except with regard to the matter about the first week in the month of April, but there are a few observations which I should like to add. It seems to me that an initial mistake has been made in these bye-laws by trying to make the same hard and fast rules apply to two perfectly different classes of tenements. The lodging-house proper, which is something in the character of a common lodging-house, may perfectly well be dealt with by a series of regulations which are really inapplicable to the very large class of houses which are brought under the common operation of these bye-laws under the words " houses occupied by members of more than one family." Take the West End of London, where, we are told, the same sort of bye-laws apply; it is not too much to say that there are many large areas in some of the best parts of London where I should think it would be no exaggeration to say that two-thirds or three-fourths of the houses are so occupied that they would come under this definition. You cannot pass through a great number of streets with which I am very familiar without finding half a dozen doctors' names up on the same door; everybody knows it is the commonest thing in the world for a medical man who has an extremely good house very highly rented to let off one or two rooms as consulting rooms to somebody else. Well, that immediately brings this house within the definition of a lodging-house, and makes all these bye-laws applicable to it, and when you come to such a case the application of the bye-law seems to me to be unreasonable to the least extent. The definition of " landlord " embraces the person who receives the rack-rent of the house. Just take the very large area, for instance, which is owned by the Duke of Portland. Probably there are 500 to 1,000 houses there of which he receives the rack-rent, and for everyone of which he would be liable as a landlord of a lodging-house within the meaning of these bye-laws; and to hold that he is liable because everyone of those houses is not thoroughly cleansed during the first week in April, or is not limewashed from top to bottom during the first week in April, would impose 62 upon the landlord in such a. case as that an absolutely intolerable burden, and one against which all good common-sense and all instincts of fair play, rebel. I only give the instance because it is quite within the extreme instances which may be given. If they are fairly within the scope of the Act, as undoubtedly that one would be, it is only by pointing out the circumstances of the bye-laws as applied in such cases that one sees whether or not, taken as a whole and as applicable all round, they are reasonable. If they were confined to the class of houses like the same sort of houses and occupied in the same sort of way as common lodging-houses, of course, there would be very much more to be said in their favour, but even there I agree with my Lord that unless the person who is struck at is a person who, from his position and from his relation to the property, ought to know exactly what his tenants are doing and in what state they are keeping the house and so on—unless he is some person of that sort it would be quite unfair to render him liable, without his having had notice of what is taking place. Now, Mr. Courthorpe-Munro defends—and it is a part of his argument that I do not like at all, and that I feel bound to protest against on the great public principles—a good deal of this by saying, " Oh, these bye-laws might be harsh and improper and unjust if they were applied all round (and they might in some cases be so), but the Borough Council, or whatever the Local Authority is, must be trusted only to put the law in motion in such cases in which it would be reasonable to do so." Now, to begin with, the Borough Council are not the only persons who are entitled to put the law in motion; every subject of the Crown is. And to go on with it, I do not like the legislation which is felt to be so unfair, applying it all round, that :t requires to be justified by saying that in particular cases it will not be enforced. I think that is as bad a ground upon which to defend legislation as you could very well have. Now I pass from that part of the case just to say one word about the first week in April. Of course, I feel fully the force of a great deal my Lord has said. One constantly knows the principles to be applied, but it is the application of principles which raises the difficulty. What I feel in this particular case is that it is hardly right to say that this can be a proper period because it is fixed by the Local Authority, to whom great discretion is necessarily committed, if it does lead in particular instances which are not chimerical at all to an almost preposterous state of the law. In one of the cases—I think it is the Islington case, but I only mention it because it shews that sometimes illustrations are not away from the point —we have had mentioned that the work which was required to be done would take a couple of men from ten days to a fortnight, working all day, to get through it. It is a fact which the Borough Council ought to have known, that Easter does very commonly fall early in April, so as to embrace part of the first week in April within its operation. I am told that in this very present year there are really four days out of the seven which are allowed which are practically excluded, and one knows 63 perfectly well that it is all very well to talk about four days—there are one or two more days when the British workman will not work if he can help it—and the result, as it seems to me, is, that the persons may be called upon to do in two or three days—and if they do not do it they would be liable to a penalty—that which would be sufficiently extensive to require several men something between a week and a fortnight. I do not think that a bye-law which can have that operation has received the consideration of its applicability to practical purposes that it ought to receive. There seems to be no sort of difficulty in meeting all the objections that have been raised to these bye-laws, and in making them, if they are re-cast, really reasonable. For the reasons I have mentioned it seems to me that in the Stepney case it is clear that the bye-law cannot be sustained. Mr. Justice Kennedy : I have come to the same conclusion, and I have come to that conclusion with a great deal of reluctance from one point of view, and that is this : That it is the health of the helpless that is very largely protected by these bye-laws, and I cannot help thinking that a good many of the points that have been taken have been points which do not occur in practice—which would raise no difficulty in practice—and in which no difficulty would arise if there was loyalty to the intentions of the Legislature on the part of those who raise these difficulties. I confess myself, that I am unable to see, at the same time, that the bye-law in either case could be supported, for the reasons given by my Lord, and I think it is important that that should have happened, because one knows perfectly well (it is not disputed here, and cannot be disputed anywhere) that persons who do not want to face liabilities which they incur by keeping property in an insanitary state, can raise a great many difficulties if they will only employ intermediate agents who they say are the only persons in touch with the tenants. So it is very difficult, 1 believe, and I can quite understand, to frame bye-laws which shall, on the one hand, really make the man who has got the profits, as the law intended (for I am only stating what I understood to be the law under the Statutes), who is really receiving the high rent for these properties, responsible, and at the same time, of course, prevent a possible injustice, which is equally to be deprecated, of a person who is loyally doing his best, but has not the opportunity of protecting himself from being attacked by summons and found liable to penalties which really he could not help. It is very difficult, no doubt, to reconcile the two, but I only say for myself entirely that it does make one inclined, as far as one can consistently do so with justice, to take a liberal and generous view of the efforts of public bodies to carry out this great sanitary legislation, and not allow either private greed or private carelessness to maintain an insanitary property. I cannot help feeling, speaking for myself, if I may, beyond doubt, that with regard to the word " landlord in the bye-law in the Stepney case, the word to be one which does make it possible for a person who is merely a rent receiver, who has let to a perfectly respectable tenant, who again sub-lets in lodgings, to make that ultimate landlord responsible without notice for an unhealthy condition of the property. You see an instance of the importance of doing something, because, in this case, according to paragraph 3, when the 64 Appellant visited the house he found the rooms and staircase dirty; and he again visited on the 14th April and he found bhe same state of dirt in this place. All I can hope is that the Local Authority will bear in mind what my Lord and my brother Wills has said and frame a bye-law which is in such terms as will avoid that which makes the present one unjust, namely—making a person responsible who may be simply landlord in the sense of the ultimate receiver of the rent, and apparently a perfectly respectable tenant who is anxious to see that the lodgings, when he lets them, are kept in a good state, and takes care that his lodgers do their duty and keep them clean, without fair notice to him of any failure on the part of those who are actually managing the premises to do their duty. I do not agree, speaking personally, as regards myself, and naturally with great respect to my brother Wills, about the period to be tied up—that you must not tie up a definite period. I cannot help thinking that local bodies, who know the local needs and who express the desire of the community by representation, and who must know their business, ought not to be lightly interfered with upon matters of management and routine such as this is. The first week in April has been found by one or two learned Magistrates in one district of London not to be unreasonable, and I should not have been inclined myself to interfere with any period they choose to fix if they are the appointed representatives of the ratepayers. With regard to the other case, I think it is impossible to accept as satisfactory, in the sense of reasonableness, the definition there of " landlord." I will not say more, having said that. I will not express my personal feeling further than to say, at any rate, that I can understand the Local Authorities thinking it arguable that " landlord " there did mean the person who was really in touch with the tenants. I say nothing more. They must make it more clear, and I hope they will adopt the recommendation of my Lord and brother Wills if they do re-consider these bye-laws as to how far they should not confine the lodgings to be dealt with in this fashion to lodgings where there is no doubt that it is practically impossible to get at the necessary sanitary results by action against the lodgers or occupants of one or two rooms. Underground Bakehouses. An underground bakehouse cannot be used as such unless it was so used at the passing of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. After January 1st, 1904, an underground bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the Borough Council. For the purposes of this Act an underground bakehouse means one which is so situated that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the bakehouse. 65 Before the underground bakehouse can be certified, the Borough Council must be satisfied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects. In order to give information to the various bakers as to what would be considered sufficient light, ventilation, and as to the necessary construction, the Council approved of certain regulations, which were supplied to each baker. The Council required that the bakehouse should have a capacity of at least 1,500 cubic feet, and should be at least 8 feet high. The floor and walls should be of smooth and impermeable material. There should be a suitable means of access other than by a ladder, and no entrance from the shop floor would be tolerated. The areas should be constructed of glazed bricks or tiled faces. The window should have a total superficial area clear of the sash frame equal to one-tenth of the floor space. There should be permanent inlets and outlets for ventilation. Proper provision should be provided for the storage of flour elsewhere than in the bakehouse, and for personal ablution, as well as for the depositing of wearing material. All troughs and tables should be provided with strong ball-bearing castors. The bakehouse should not be in communication with a washliouse, nor with any room containing objectionable material. These regulations were strictly enforced, save that in a very few, a slight modification of the height was made. The Public Health Committee decided " that in. very exceptional cases, where the cubical capacity of a bakehouse is sufficient, and the general conditions are such as to inflict a great hardship, should a certificate be refused in consequence of its being found impossible to attain the height mentioned, owing to the position of the sewer, and not on the ground of expense, the Committee does not propose to insist upon a height of more than 7 feet 6 inches." It is satisfactory to know that in only four bakehouses was it found necessary to lower the standard from 8 feet to 7 feet 6 inches. 70 underground bakehouses complied with our regulations and certificates were granted. Conveniences for depositing the wearing material of the workmen and for personal ablution were newly provided in all of them. This will tend to secure enhanced cleanliness in the baking of bread. All the troughs and tables were without ballbearing castors. It was therefore impossible to keep the floors as clean as it will be in future, now that the castors have been provided. Five bakehouses were found to have less than the required 1,500 cubic feet capacity, and had to be enlarged. The E 66 height was less than 8 feet in 32 of the bakehouses. The floor was dug out so as to obtain the necessary height in all these. In 64 of the bakehouses the walls and floor had to be rendered hard, smooth and impermeable. In a large number the entrance to the bakehouse was by means of a step-ladder from the floor of the shop; 34 staircases had to be consequently altered. Fifty bakehouses were found to be without sufficient light and ventilation. Twenty-two bakers had no means of storing the flour except in the bakehouse itself. In twentythree there were either no coal-cellar and the coal was stored in the bakehouse, or it opened directly from the bakehouse. Drains had to be disconnected in twelve bakehouses. Four underground bakehouses were discontinued and new ones constructed above ground in the rear of the premises, viz. :— 89, Sydney Street. 278, Cable Street. 131, Salmon Lane. 77, Plummers Row. Two wholesale premises where machinery is used were granted certificates, viz.:— 1, Alie Place. | 177—183, Commercial Road.

It will be seen above that Boracic Acid is present in milk and butter. In addition to milk and butter, this preservative is used extensively in the preservation of cream, margarine, ham, bacon, sausages, and to a very small extent in beverages such as herb beer. With the exception of margarine, these articles are not analysed under the Foods and Drugs Acts. In addition to Boracic Acid, Salicylic Acid is also used, but to a less extent. This preservative is generally added to beverages such as wines, beer, cider, and temperance drinks, as well as to foods derived from fruit (jams and jellies). Sulphites are also added to the latter. A great quantity of raspberry pulp comes from New Zealand. The action of the Sulphites is to take away the colour of the natural fruit and to make it of a very much lighter shade. To obviate this, one of the aniline dyes is often added to restore it to its natural colour before the jam which is made from the pulp is put on the market. The addition of Formalin to milk has also increased largely of late years. In considering the effect of a certain preservative in a particular article of food on the health of the consumer, one ought to take into consideration that it is not the only article consumed that this preservative is added to. Take Boracic Acid, for instanct The amount that is consumed in butter is not the only quantity that is absorbed F 82 into the system. When added to milk it is done indiscriminately by farmer, wholesale dealer and retail dealer. Neither of these take the trouble to find out what is the least quantity that will prevent the milk decomposing. When the farmer has added the preservatve, he does not inform the wholesale dealer that the milk contains any preservative. The latter therefore, adds perhaps, a similar preservative. When the milk reaches the retail milk vendor, as he has had no notice that the milk contains preservative, he, of his own accord adds another quantity of either the same preservative, or a preservative of a different kind. During the hot weather it is therefore, possible, that preservatives have been added to the milk on three different occasions. On account of the cool summer there was not so much Boracic Acid added to milk as in previous years in this district. The addition of Formalin seems to have, however, increased. Leaving the healthy adult out of the question for the moment, I do not think that anyone can justify the addition of even the smallest quantity of preservative to milk, that is either given to infants or to the sick, for whom, in many cases, it constitutes by far the most important, if not the only source of nourishment. In this district, where we know what a large percentage of the infants are brought up entirely upon cow's milk, no one knows, to what extent the addition of preservatives is responsible for the infantile mortality. In these cases, as the infants become older and naturally drink a larger quantity of milk, the amount of preservatives consumed must be enormous. It is true that the addition of a small quantity of the preservative prevents the decomposition of the milk, and that the consumption of such sour milk is a frequent cause of Summer Diarrhoea. The preservative hinders the development of the micro-organisms that cause decomposition, therefore, when introduced into the human body it cannot behave indifferently to living matter, and must exert a deleterious influence upon the cells which are engaged in the secretion of digestive juices. The addition of preservatives to milk is likely to tend to uncleanly methods in collection and storage. It is curious, but undoubtedly true, as far as my experience goes, that the dirtiest man on the milkman's premises is the one that is responsible for milking the cows. We can take proceedings for dirty milk utensils on the premises, but there is no remedy against the "cowman," whose hands are far dirtier than it is possible for any milk utensil to become. Frequently when I have visited the various cowsheds in the district it would be mere guess-work to give any idea when his hands were last washed properly. Some of the milk analysed is found to be in a filtlhy condition. Particles of manure, hay, straw, and insects are often seen when the milk is poured out of the sample bottles. As dirty milk decomposes far quicker than clean milk, the presence of preservatives should tend to raise suspicion as to its cleanliness. Some well-known dairy companies do not use any preservatives. Indeed, it is unreasonable that the public should be drugged against their will and in ignorance that they are being so drugged. 83 The Royal Commission on Food Preservatives made the following recommendations : — (1) That the use of formalin in foods or drinks be absolutely prohibited, and that salicylic acid be not used in greater proportion than one grain per pint in liquid food and 1 grain per pound in solid food. Its presence in all cases to be declared. (2) That the use of any preservative or colouring matter whatever in milk offered for sale in the United Kingom be constituted an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. (3) That the only preservative which it shall be lawful to use in cream be boric acid or mixtures of boric acid and borax, and in amount not exceeding .25 per cent. expressed as boric acid. The amount of such preservative to be notified by a label upon the vessel. (4) That the only preservative permitted to be used in butter and margarine be boric acid or mixture of boric acid and borax, to be used in proportions not exceeding .5 per cent. expressed as boric acid. (5) That in the case of all dietetic preparations intended for the use of invalids or infants, chemical preservatives of all kinds be prohibited. (6) That the use of copper salts in the so-called greening of preserved foods be prohibited. (7) That means be provided either by the establishment of a separate Court of Reference or by the imposition of more direct obligation on the Local Government Board, to exercise supervision over the use of preservatives and colouring matters in foods, and to prepare schedules of such as may be considered inimical to the public health. Though the Commission issued their Report in 1901, no action has yet been taken by the Legislature in promoting a bill on the lines indicated in the above recommendations. Factory and Workshop Act. There were on the Register at the end of the year 1,655 workshops. 2,266 visits were made to these. 79 were found to be overcrowded, but the nuisance was abated as soon as the owners received a notice from us. It was not found necessary to take Police Court proceedings in a single instance. Additional means of ventilation were provided in 68 workshops. Many workshops were found to be without sufficient water-closet accommodation, and 123 additional ones were provided. 84 REGISTERED WORKSHOPS. Nature of Employment. Total number of workshops.

During the year, 51 new houses, and 18 model dwellings comprising 133 tenements were completed, and were afterwards occupied by 2,238 persons. There was, therefore, more accommodation provided than there was an increase of the estimated population. The house famine in the Borough two years ago forced up the rents abnormally high. This was one, if not the most important, factor in the causation of overcrowding. For some reasons, there is at the present time plenty of house accommodation in the district. There are of course more empty houses in some parts than in the others. One reason is the number of new houses that were built during the year, which included a number of large blocks of model buildings. A large number of these dwellings have been constructed during recent year's. This is, however, far from being responsible for so many of the empty houses. Among the number of dwellings completed during the year was Mann's Buildings, which were erected on the insanitary area cleared by the late Limehouse District Board of Works, and known as Queen Catherine Court Area. The Local Government Board held an enquiry on March 16th, 1893, and approved of the scheme in October of that year. Immediately afterwards the necessary steps were taken for the clearance of the site. It thus took more than twelve years from the time that the official representation was made by the Medical Officer of Health in 1891 to the time the new buildings were constructed and occupied. The clearing of an insanitary area under the Housing of the Working Classes Act is bound to have a tendency to increase overcrowding in neighbouring houses. It is true that all the persons displaced are not obliged to live in the vicinity, and many probably leave the neighbourhood. In this district, where so many men are employed at the docks, wharves, etc., where they are engaged to unload ships frequently in the small hours of the morning, they cannot possibly live far from the river side. If their houses be demolished they are bound to be factors in the causation of overcrowding and high rents in the districts adjoining. When new buildings are therefore erected on the site that has been cleared, they will be occupied by a different class of people to the persons displaced. In the first place, the rents that were formerly paid in the slums were very much less than the rents that must be charged for the new rooms, in order to prevent a loss on the undertaking. Even if the rents of the new dwellings remain the same, or are only slightly higher, I doubt whether many of the people originally displaced would reside in them, as this class of people generally resent the regulations which are naturally enforced for the well-being of such new dwellings. 88 Large models, when erected, generally replace small houses which have been demolished. The rooms in the small houses in back streets are more often overcrowded than the rooms in model dwellings. The displacement of density in rooms is therefore replaced by density on space. It is undoubtedly a vast improvement, but it must not be thought to be an unmixed blessing. As there are practically no back-to-back houses in the strict sense of the word in this district, the houses generally have a yard of some sort for the children to play in, during some part of the day. In a few instances, where there are no yards at the rear of the premises, the Court is entered by a narrow neck, where no vehicles can enter, as in Newton's Rents. The space in front of the houses is then used by the children as a kind of private playground. On the higher floors of model dwellings, on the other hand, the mothers cannot afford the time to take the young children downstairs, and as it is frequently too dangerous for them to go by themselves, they are kept indoors, generally in the kitchen. They are therefore not allowed to have the fresh air which is absolutely essential for their well-being. This bad condition of affairs is accentuated where a family occupies two or three rooms, and in order to prevent overcrowding of the bedroom, a bed is placed in the kitchen. This condition is almost a daily occurrence. The room where the younger children live by day, has been used during the previous night, thus rendering it more imperative for the children to have opportunities to spend as much time as possible in the open air. As I stated above, this cannot be done in a large majority of model dwellings, and thus detracts a little from the advantages they otherwise undoubtedly possess over the small and admittedly insanitary houses, that have been displaced. The procedure under the Act must to a certain extent be made public. This gives an opportunity to certain shrewd house speculators to buy the property, raise the rents, and by the time the Local Authority is ready to negotiate for its purchase, the property is very much enhanced in value. This took place in the Back Church Lane Area, but as the London County Council ultimately refused to proceed with the scheme, the speculators must have made a bad investment, especially as they were immediately called upon to carry out extensive sanitary repairs. If the scheme had been proceeded with, this speculation would have rendered the property more expensive to purchase, and thus would have affected the rents of the houses that would have ultimately been erected on the site. Back Church Lane Area. On October 23rd, 1901, after a consultation with, and at the suggestion of, the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, I made an official 89 sentation to the County Council that a certain area in St. George's—known as the Back Church Lane Area—was insanitary and ought to be dealt with under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, because : — (1) The houses, courts or alleys within the said area were unfit for human habitation. (2) The narrowness, closeness and bad arrangement or the bad condition of the streets and houses, or groups of houses, within such area, or the want of light, air, ventilation, or proper conveniences, or any other sanitary defects, or one or more of such causes, were dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants either of the buildings in the said area or of the neighbouring buildings. (3) The evils connected with such houses, courts or alleys, and the sanitary defects in such area, could not be effectually remedied, otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the re-arrangement and re-construction of the streets and houses within such area, or of some of such streets or houses. The area comprised the following: — Houses. Families. Persons. Back Church Lane (part of) 17 28 133 Batty Gardens 19 27 143 Berner Street 11 29 125 Boyd Street 51 53 294 Everard Street 48 61 353 Fairclough Street 13 21 95 Gloucester Buildings 35 194 37 256 226 1,369 In addition to the above, the area contained 7 more premises consisting of a locked-up shed, stables, and workshops. The area is bounded on the north by Batty Gardens, on the south by Ellen Street, on the west by Back Church Lane, and on the east by Berner Street. The scheme did not include any houses in Ellen Street. The area comprised about two acres. 90 Batty Gardens.—These houses are approached from Back Church Lane by a passage about 102 feet long, with an average width of 9 feet. On the south side of this passage are Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14; and on the north side is a brick wall and timber hoarding about 15 feet high. It extends the whole length of the passage. In front of No. 16 is an open space of 7 feet by 8 feet, bounded by a hoarding about 15 feet high. Nos. 9 and 11 abut on a narrow footway leading to Berner Street. Between Nos. 18 and 20 there is a narrow footway 29 feet long and 5 feet wide, which separates them from a brick wall in front. At the Berner's Street end the " Gardens " are entered by a courtway 3½ feet wide and 6½ feet high and 20 feet long, which then opens into a quadrangle where Nos. 17, 21, 25, 27, 22, 24, and 26 are situated. The whole of the houses were structurally defective and the walls decayed and rotten. The brickwork was largely composed of "place" bricks and "bats".—pieces of bricks. Owing to the porous nature of the bricks and the absence of damp-proof courses, the walls were always damp. The brickwork of many of the premises was cracked or bulging, especially that of Nos. 2, 8, 10, 11, 16, 18, 20, and 24. Some showed evidence of attempts being made to repair them at various times. There was no ventilation beneath the lower floors, the boards being in most cases in contact with damp earth. The stairs were narrow, steep and dangerous. The doors, window sashes, floors of the rooms and all the internal fittings were decayed and worn out. The floors of the basement of nine houses were below the level of the ground outside. The windows were fixed and could not be opened in the basement rooms of four houses. The flashing apparatus of nine water-closets was defective. Back Church Lane.—The scheme included premises on the east side of Back Church Lane, and consisted of 17 dwelling houses, a range of stabling with yard, and some vacant land. 91 Nos. 70 and 72 were in good condition; the yard of No. 70 was very small, and had an area of 18 feet only. No. 76 was structurally defective, the walls being damp, and the yard had an area of 28 feet only. The brickwork of No. 78—with the exception of that of the water-closet—was in a fair condition. No. 80 had reoently been rebuilt. The brickwork of Nos. 82, 82a, 82b, and 84 was in a fair condition. Nos. 98, 100, 102, and 104 were in a fair condition, with the exception of the basements, which were damp. Nos. 108, 110, and 112 were thoroughly worn out, being decayed, rotten and bulging. The front part of No. 114 had been newly done up, but the basement as well as the interior part of the house was worn out and rotten. The walls were very damp. There was no ventilation underneath the basement floors of 13 of the houses, and the water-closets of eight houses were defective in one way or another. Berner Street.—The scheme consisted of the following houses on the west side of the street, viz.: Nos. 28 to 40, 40a, 42 to 46 inclusive. Many of the premises were structurally defective The brickwork was rotten and the walls were damp. There was no ventilation beneath any of the lower floors, and the joists in many cases were resting on damp earth. There was an entire absence of damp-proof courses, and the walls were composed of soft, under-burnt bricks, which, of course, rendered the houses very damp. The owners had in most of the houses covered the lower portion of the walls with boarding. This did not remedy the evil, but concealed the true state of affairs. The basement rooms were the worst, being damp, dark, insufficiently lighted and ventilated. The woodwork generally was worn out and rotten. The water-closets of six of the houses were defective. Boyd Street.—Most of the houses in this street consisted of three very small rooms with a small yard at the rear. Nos. 33, 35 to 50, and 52 had basements, the ceilings of which were on a level with the public footway, and in some cases were even below that level. The walls of these basement rooms were damp, the side next to the street being quite unprotected from dampness arising from contact with the soil. There were no dampproof courses. There was no ventilation underneath the lower floors. Some of the floors 92 were below the level of the yard paving. These rooms did not possess sufficient light and ventilation, being very dark and gloomy. The whole of the woodwork and internal fittings were worn out and decayed. The stairs were narrow, steep, and dangerous. The brickwork of the front walls was in many cases defective and dilapidated. The walls of Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 25, 27, and 33 to 47 (odd numbers) had been repointed; Nos. 13 and 15 bulged. Nos. 25 and 27 had been repointed. Nos. 29 and 31 had been repaired. The walls of Nos. 2 to 20 (even numbers), 26 to 30, 36, 38, bulged, The walls of Nos. 22, 24, 32, and 34 had been repointed. The brickwork of these houses was largely composed of soft, under-burnt bricks. The water-closets were defective in 13 houses, and in two of them the doors were so small that they could not be shut properly. Two water-closets had been recently demolished and had not been reconstructed. Everard Street.—A large number of the houses have three rooms with a small back yard belonging to each house. Nos. 32, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, and 51 have basement rooms, the ceilings of which are on a level with, and in some cases below the level of the public footway. The walls of these basement rooms are damp, the ones nearest to the street being unprotected from the dampness which arises through being in direct contact with the soil. There were no damp-proof courses. There was no ventilation beneath the ground floors, and some of the ground floors were below the level of the yard paving. These basement rooms were dark and gloomy. They had not sufficient light and ventilation. The woodwork and internal fittings generally of the whole of the houses were decayed and worn out. The stairs were narrow, steep and dangerous. The brickwork as well as the woodwork of many of the closets were rotten and dilapidated. The brickwork of the backfronts and of the ground floor back rooms was dilapidated and bulging. The front walls of Nos. 1 to 21 (odd numbers), 27 to 31, 2 to 8, 22, 44 to 50, bulged. Nos. 23, 25, 10 to 20 had been recently repaired. 93 No. 40 was defective and dangerous. The brickwork was largely composed of soft bricks. The brickwork, roof, or flushing apparatus were defective in 25 of the water closets. The rents varied from 6s. 6d. to 10s. a week. The rents of most of the houses had been raised sixpence a week during the year previous to the date on which I made the official representation. The rents of six houses were raised 2s. a week during the previous two years, and of one 1s. 6d. a week. Fairclough Street.—With the exoeption of No. 1—which had no yard—all the houses had basement rooms, the ceilings of which were on a level with the public footway, and the floors were on a level with the yard paving. The front walls were unprotected from the dampness of the soil, and were consequently always in a damp condition. In some instances boards had been placed to conceal it. The basement rooms had not sufficient light and ventilation. There was no ventilation beneath the ground floor. The yards at the rear of these houses, with one exception, had an area of 100 feet. The brickwork of Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 23, 25, and 27, was decayed and bulging. The brickwork of Nos. 15 to 21 had been recently repaired and was in fair condition. The woodwork, however, of these houses, as well as the floors, stairs, doors, window-sashes were dilapidated. The stairs leading to the basements were steep, narrow, and dangerous. The brickwork and flushing apparatus were defective in 3 of the water-closets. The rents varied from 6s. to 10s. a week, and in three instances had been raised 1s. a week during the previous year. Gloucester Buildings.— Each building contains four small rooms and a yard. The buildings are approached from the east side of Back Church Lane by an entrance which is closed by a pair of iron gates to all but those on foot. The other end is a cul-de-sac. The court in front of the houses is 214 feet long by 17 feet wide, and is paved with asphalte. The ground floors of the basement rooms are unventilated, many of them being below the level of the footway. The lower part of the walls is damp owing to inferior bricks having been used and the absence of damp-proof courses. With the exception of No. 7 the brickwork of the front walls was in a failcondition. The brickwork of many of the back walls as well as that of the waterclosets was decayed and bulging. 94 The light in the back rooms of Nos. 3 to 19 was obstructed by a brick building, the average height of which was 25 feet. This building combined with the smallness of the yards at the rear of each house (which varied from 20 to 90 feet) prevented the free access of air and sunlight. The woodwork was generally worn out. The stairs were narrow, steep, and dangerous. Some of the houses were overcrowded. The rooms were so small that with three exceptions, each room could accommodate two persons only, without being considered to be overcrowded (allowing 400 cubic feet to each adult for living and sleeping purposes). Some of the rooms contained less than 400 cubic feet. Such a state of affairs could only be remedied of course by entire reconstruction of the premises. The brickwork or flushing apparatus were defective in 12 of the water-closets. The rents varied from 7s. to 9s. a week. In 27 of the houses the rents were raised sixpence a week, a few weeks previous to the date of my official representation. In three houses the rents had been raised 1s. a week two years previously. During the year 1901 there were 22 deaths in this area, which was at the annual rate of 16 per 1,000. The death-rate for the whole of St. George's was 23 per 1,000, and for the whole of Stepney the death-rate was 20.8 per 1,000. For several years the death-rate of St. George's has been over-estimated, inasmuch as the population was under-estimated by 3,090 as compared with the actual census population. Of these deaths, 12 were those of children under one year of age, so that 54.5 per cent. of all the deaths in this area were those of infants under a twelve-month old. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age compared to the total number of deaths in the whole of St. George's was only 25.9 per cent. During the year 1902, there were 23 deaths in the area, or a death-rate of 16.8 per 1,000. Seven of these deaths were those of children under one year of age, and another nine were those of children between one and five years of age. In the years 1901 and 1902, 31 out of the 45 deaths were those of children under five years of age. Of these 45 deaths, 13 were due to inflammatory affections of the lungs, 7 to Diarrhoea, 2 to Erysipelas, and 5 to Phthisis. The death-rate from inflammatory affections of the lungs was 4.8 per 1,000, and 1.8 per 1,000 from Phthisis. 95 I admit the death-rate was low, and was not of much assistance in recommending the scheme. This is true of a large number of insanitary areas that have of recent years been cleared in London and elsewhere. In this instance, perhaps, it was due to some extent to the large number of people at the healthiest period of their existence. 44 were children under 1 year of age. 173 were children between 1 and 5 years of age. 360 were between 5 and 15 years of age. 235 were between 15 and 25 years of age. 530 were between 25 and 65 years of age. 27 were over 65 years of age. 1,369 The number of infectious diseases notified was 8 in 1901 and 10 in 1902. These numbers again were less relatively than that for the whole of the Borough. The representation was considered by the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council on February 25th, 1903. The Committee's report, after viewing the area., was that with regard to that portion of the area north of Fairclough Street, " we may describe the houses in Batty's Gardens as being mostly small houses. Many of them are only two storeys in height, and some are damp and in bad repair. Some of the houses in Berner Street are old and decayed, but those in Fairclough Street are in better condition. This part of the area changed hands in 1901 and again just recently at a greatly enhanced price. There appears also every prospect that this part of the area will shortly be rebuilt for commercial purposes. Having regard to these facts, we are of opinion that as regards this portion of the area there is no adequate reason why any scheme for its improvement under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, should be undertaken by the Council. The south part of the area consists of six rows of small houses, nearly all of which are two storeys in height and almost entirely occupied by foreigners. They are practically worn out, and have cramped yard space in rear. They cannot, however, be said to be in a generally insanitary condition. The three streets on this portion of the area are narrow, but having regard to the lowness of the houses abutting upon them, we are unable to say that they require re-arrangement for this reason. Indeed, their whole appearance is such that we could not justify their inclusion in a scheme under Part I. of the Act." The Council recommended that no improvement scheme be made in pursuance of the official representation, and this was confirmed at the Council meeting of March 10 th, 1903. 96 In forwarding a copy of the resolution, the Clerk to the London County Council stated, " a further reason which influenced the Council in its decision was the fact that the Council was advised that the southern portion of the area referred to in the report will in all probability be converted into use for commercial purposes at no distant date." At present there are no signs that such hopes will be realised. As soon as I received information that the scheme had been definitely abandoned by the London County Council, I caused notices to be served on the owners of the various houses to have the sanitary defects remedied. The eaves, gutters, and rainwater pipes were either repaired or replaced by new ones. The roofs were made weatherproof. The brickwork of a large number of the houses was cleaned and pointed. The walls and ceilings of the rooms were cleansed. The waterclosets were repaired, and where the water supply had been cut off it was restored. The remedies related, however, to the decorative rather than the structural part of the buildings. This review of the year's sanitary work in the District, shows that the progress in sanitary matters has been fully maintained during 1903. I beg to express my indebtedness to the Sanitary Inspectors and Clerical Staff for the manner in which they have assisted me in carrying out the duties of my office. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, D. L. THOMAS, Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst. Public Health Offices, 43, White Horse Street, Commercial Road, E.
