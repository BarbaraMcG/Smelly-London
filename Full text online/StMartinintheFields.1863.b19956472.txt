THE Eighth Annual Report OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE VESTRY OF ST. MARTIN-IN-THE-FIELDS FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1864. In conformity with the 110th Section of "The Metropolis Local Management Act," the following Report of the affairs and business of the Vestry during the past year, accompanied by an Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure, duly audited as required by the Act, is now prepared. vestry meetings and committees. The Return attached to this Report will show that the Vestry has held 31 meetings, and the Committees appointed by the Vestry have held 48 meetings during the year. the attorney-general V. lord craven—the pesthouse field charity. During the past year the subject of the hospital to be selected under the direction of the Master of the Rolls for the appropriation and application of the Trust 6 Funds has been much discussed, and although efforts were made by this Vestry to induce the Governors of the Charing Cross Hospital to provide the required accommodation for the objects of the Charity, embracing a provision for persons afflicted with contagious and infectious disorders, it was discovered that such arrangements were inconsistent with the rules of the Hospital and therefore could not be made by the Governors. The result has been that on comparing the advantages offered by various hospitals in the metropolis, it was found that King's College Hospital offered the greatest amount of accommodation, and it is therefore probable that it will be selected, and that the whole of the funds of the Charity, by a scheme to be finally settled by the Master of the Rolls, will be paid to the Governors of the Hospital, who in that case will be required to supply such number of beds as may be prescribed by the scheme, subject to such rules and regulations as may be thereby declared. The Annual Income is at present about £100 per annum and an increase of it may be expected within a short period. Leicester Square. At the close of the year ending 25th March, 1863, a Bill called "The Regent Market, Leicester Square Bill," was pending before the House of Commons. Petitions against it were presented by this Vestry, the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Inhabitants of Leicester Square, the Vestry of St. James Westminster, and the Marquis of Salisbury. It was decided by the Committee, to whom the Bill was referred, that the Petitioners in two out of the five Petitions could not be heard, and for this and other reasons the principal urthen of opposing the Bill fell to the lot of this Vestry. 7 I, therefore, appeared on several days before the Committee in opposition to the Preamble of the Bill, and examined various witnesses in support of the opposition. The result was entirely successful, inasmuch as the Committee unanimously decided that the preamble was not proved. The Bill was therefore thrown out. Since that time the attempt to build upon the open area of the Square has not been renewed. Metropolis Railways. Shortly before the commencement of the present Session of Parliament various plans for making railways by taking property in and otherwise affecting this parish, were deposited, and 11 notices of intended applications to Parliament for constructing such railways were given. Such of them as were able to satisfy the Standing Orders, relating to the deposit of the necessary portion of the capital of the proposed Companies, were submitted for the consideration of a Joint Committee of the Houses of Lords and Commons, who recommended that only one of them should be allowed at to proceed during the present Session. That Bill is entitled "The Hampstead, Midland, North-Western, and Charing Cross Railway Bill." It recommended itself to the Joint Committee and to this Vestry, by proposing that in conjunction with an Underground Railway from Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, to Charing Cross, the Railway Company should construct a series of streets from the corner of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to Charing Cross and thus provide what has been long wanted, viz., a good thoroughfare to carry away the traffic from the Strand to the North-Western and Western Districts of the Metropolis. As, however, such a measure will necessarily 8 fere with the existing thoroughfares during the progress of the works, and take away considerable property liable to the parish rates, and will otherwise affect the parish interests, the Vestry have decided to petition against it for the purpose of securing such protective clauses as may be necessary. Fore-Court of Charing Cross Railway Station, Strand. In August, 1863, the Charing Cross Railway Company furnished the Vestry with plans and sections shewing the manner in which they proposed to enclose the area in front of their Station and the Strand. The enclosure and the erections proposed to be made within it being deemed objectionable and contrary to the intention of the Legislature, the Vestry resolved to memorialize the Metropolitan Board to withdraw their consent thereto, and to compel the Company to maintain the area as an open public space. The memorial was presented, and the Committee were invited to attend, and accordingly attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Board, when the matter came on for discussion. The Vestry were subsequently informed by the Metropolitan Board that they had given permission to the Company to inclose the fore-court, contrary to the wishes of the Vestry. contracts. The Contracts entered into during the current year will hereafter appear, sanitary measures. The Medical Officer's Report is attached showing the progress of sanitary measures. In connection therewith the Vestry have caused 110 9 notices for abatement of nuisances to be served during the past year, four summonses have been issued to compel the inhabitants to abate the various nuisances complained of. In the other cases the notices have been complied with. surveyor's report. Under this head, all the works done under the direction of the Vestry, including amongst others the construction of a new sewer in Villiers Street, will appear. charities. Bound up with this Annual Report will be found a detailed account of the Receipts and Expenditure of the various funds in this parish devoted to charitable purposes, and distributed by the Churchwardens in the support of Alms Women and Out-Pensioners elected by the Vestry.

There have been registered in the parish during the year 1803, 614 births and 593 deaths. The following Table shews by comparison with former years that 1863 was the most unhealthy year since 1859. A comparison of deaths from the prevalent epidemics will be interesting, although amongst this class of diseases there is no such difference with preceding years to account for the general increase. We had last year 12 deaths from small-pox, and only 5 from this disease during the eight preceding years; measles exhibited but little variation from the general average; scarlet fever has been a very fatal disease for the last two years, from whooping cough and diarrhoea the number of deaths has been about the average; but fever has been only fatal in 17 cases, against 53 in 1862. The deaths in children under 5 have not exceeded the average, nor have those of persons over 60 years; the great increase in the mortality has been among 22 the more active portion of the population, at the ages from 20 to 60.

The Charing Cross district, which is inhabited by a wealthier class than that of Long Acre, and also contains a smaller number of courts and small streets occupied by the labouring classes exhibits a smaller proportion of deaths in children under 5 years and also from epidemic diseases. We all know that the unhappy conditions under which the poor live in crowded dwellings, where often a large family live in a single room far too small for them, and consequently in an atmosphere most injurious to health, and especially deleterious in its operation on disease, in retarding recovery, and too often preventing recovery altogether. The same facts are shewn by comparing the proportion of deaths in children, and from zymotic diseases, in those courts and streets of the two districts which are most populous, with the better classes of streets, where but few poor people live. The conclusion we arrive at is that among the labouring classes a larger proportion of children die from the same kind of disease than among the better housed classes, and that the conditions under which multitudes are obliged to live become accessory to the destruction of large numbers of our people, not only children but adults, who when attacked by ordinary diseases too often fall victims, from the wretched ventilation and poisonous atmosphere they are obliged to breathe in the pent-up rooms where they live. The death-rate of St. Martin's is very high, but 26 there are some exceptionable circumstances which may in a measure account for it. We have annually many deaths added to those of our own population of persons who have come to London for medical advice and die at some of the lodging-houses or hotels in the parish. The ordinary proportion of deaths in children under 5 years is about one-third of the total number: but, from inspecting the Tables 2 and 3, some of the streets and courts show a larger proportion. For example, Bedford-bury 8 in 18, Bullin Court 3 in 5, &c., &c. Table No. 4. Table Of Mortality, In the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, AT THE AGES FROM 5 TO 60. 5 to 20. 20 to 40. 40 to 60.

The above table of deaths during the active period of human life shews the large amount of fatal diseases at ages earlier than in a well-constituted system ought to occur, and which we may hope to see diminish as the science of health is more appreciated and more studied by the public. The inspections of 350 houses during the year have given evidence of considerable improvements in cleanliness, water supply, and the abatement of nuisanccs. We may look forward to the embankment of the river as a means of exercise and recreation in a large open space and its influence in the promotion of health. Let us hope that our legislators will not lose the opportunity of benefiting our people by making some use of the ground to be regained from the river in the establishment of playgrounds, gymnasia, swimming baths, &c. There can be no better economy than in expending public money in such appropriate means for the increase of the health and strength of the people. 28 TABLE OF THE CAUSES of death, AT VARIOUS AGES, In the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, for the Year 1863.

Those labouring under sickness,' or other infirmities, are provided with Nurses at the charge of the Funds. A Chaplain attends at Chapel on Sunday and Thursday in each week, to perform Divine Service: they are also attended by an eminent Medical Gentleman, and are furnished with Medicine free of charge. The Out - Pensjoners consist of Ten Married Couples, each Couple receiving 30s per Calendar Month: Twenty Single Persons receive 20s. per Calendar Month each; they have been also Housekeepers in the Parish. The Vestry having found that several applicants for the Alms Fund preferred receiving the Out-Pension and living with them friends, instead of residing in the Alms Houses, have during the last few years, elected the most deserving applicants as Out-Pensioners, by which means the Alms' Fund has been distributed between a larger number of Out-Pensioners than formerly. The number of Pensioners on the Fund in March, 1861, were as follows:—58 Almswomen, 8 Married Couples, and 39 Single Persons Out-Pensioners.
