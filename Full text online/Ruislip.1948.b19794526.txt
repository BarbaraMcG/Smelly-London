To the Chairman and Members of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, On 31st March, 1948, Mr. S. P. Bristow, c.r.s.i., m.s.i.a., Senior Sanitary Inspector, retired after 29 years' loyal service with the Council, and I should like to record my appreciation of his work for the Public Health Department during my term of office and to wish him health and prosperity in the future. We have been fortunate in securing the services of Mr. E. H. Jenkins, m.san.i.a., m.r.s.i., formerly Sanitary Inspector of Fulham Borough Council, in his stead, who has taken up his new duties enthusiastically. The health of the District has again been satisfactory. No cases of Smallpox were reported. A few cases of Anterior Poliomyelitis occurred but these were merely sporadic and did not assume epidemic proportions as in 1947. One case occurred in a member of the gymnastic team from Czechoslovakia competing in the Olympic Games, and I regret to state that she died. It was evident that this competitor arrived in this country with the disease in its early stages. All precautions for isolation of contacts and disinfection of the premises at St. Helen's School were promptly enforced and I am glad to report that no further cases occurred. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the midyear 1948, namely 64,270 shows a slight decrease from that of 1947, namely 64,590, in part no doubt due to the decrease of the birth rate from 19.120 to 17.099 per 1,000 population for the same two years. The number of inhabited houses in April, 1948, was 18,205. The death rate from all causes for the two years has also fallen slightly from 7.772 in 1947 to 7.686 per 1,000 population in 1948. This compares very favourably with the Registrar-General's estimate for England and Wales, namely 10.8. Statistical tables are set out in detail on subsequent pages. 2 It will be noticed from the statistical reports that the work of the Public Health Department has greatly increased during the year, notably in the way of supervision of foodshops, restaurants and food vehicles and the education of food handlers in the principles of the hygienic handling of foodstuffs. Particular attention has been paid to the cleanliness of milk, water and ice creams as well as to the open-air Lido at Ruislip. In all other cases the reports have been, with few exceptions, satisfactory. The chief anxiety has been with regard to the grading of ice cream, but it is hoped that by careful supervision and education of purveyors, noticeable improvement will occur during the next year. The work of the Department has continued smoothly but vigorously throughout the year, thanks to the untiring efforts of the Sanitary, Rodent and Clerical personnel, to whom I acknowledge my sincere gratitude for their helpful co-operation. I am, Your obedient Servant, L. D. BAILEY, Medical Officer of Health. 3 Statistics ACREAGE OF THE DISTRICT Northwood Ward 1,979 acres Eastcote Ward 1,378 acres Ruislip Ward 1,790 acres South Ruislip Ward 1,437 acres Total area of district 6,584 acres POPULATION The Registrar-General's estimate of the population for the midyear 1948 is 64,270. 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 55,830 56,950 62,070 64,590 64,270 Number of Inhabited dwellings in April, 1948, was 18,205.

Measles, Whooping Cough and Scarlet Fever show no marked difference from last year. As will be seen from the above there was only one case of food poisoning in the district during the year, which is extremely satisfactory. TUBERCULOSIS According to statistics obtained from the Chest Clinic, Uxbridge, the number of new pulmonary cases notified in this district was 64, one more than last year. The number of non-pulmonary cases notified was three, three less than last year. On the other hand, the inward transfers have risen from 16 up to 30, and the outward transfers total 11. The total number of cases in the district is 418, a percentage of .650 of population, which does not appear excessive. MASS RADIOGRAPHY In September/October the Mass Radiography Unit No. 1 paid a visit to this district. The following figures show the number of persons X-rayed and those who were recalled for a second examination. It must be emphasised that this second examination does not always mean infection from tuberculosis but may have regard to some abnormality of the chest or the heart. 7 Summary of Survey Male Female Total Number examined 2,760 1,253 4,013 Number recalled for large films 168 Disposal of Large Film Cases (a) No further action 110 (b) To return to Unit for further X-ray 2 (c) Further investigation required (this does not necessarily indicate tuberculosis) 44 (d) Known cases had or having treatment 9 (e) Failed to return for large films 3 Special arrangements were made for housewives in the district to attend by appointment made through this Department. The scheme ran very smoothly and it is intended to repeat it again in 1949. 8 General Provisions of Health Services in the District.

The water supplied to this area is not plumbo-solvent. 19 The average hardness of samples of water taken during the year is:— Total hardness 21.8 Permanent hardness 3.6 Temporary hardness 18.2 All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to use and samples of water from them are tested bacteriologically to ensure the purity of the water.
