CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in presenting to you the Annual Report including the report of the Senior Sanitary Inspector, for the year ending 31st December, 1954. vital statistics The birth rate, at 13.7 per 1,000 of the population, continues to fall; the total death rate, at 9.0 per 1,000 remains unchanged. Both these figures are significantly below the averages for England and Wales as a whole, after correction for local differences in age and sex distribution of the population. Deaths of infants and still-births also remain at a level much lower than the average national rate, and again there were no maternal deaths in the district from pregnancy, childbirth or abortion. As in previous recent years, heart disease and cancer are the main causes of death; these diseases, and related conditions, account for approximately two out of every three deaths which occur. Coronary disease and angina alone, accounted for 64 deaths in 1954, compared with 52 in 1953 and 40 in 1952. If the latest theories about this disease are correct, these figures should be taken as a warning by all those who take too much rich food and too little exercise, especially if accompanied by mental stress! infectious diseases. These have ceased to be of any importance as a cause of death, owing to improved methods of prevention and treatment. The newly introduced schemes for detection of, and vaccination against, tuberculosis have become a routine procedure as part of the school health service, and have been well received by the public, and immunisation against whooping cough, diphtheria and smallpox continues. The clean food campaign is also making slow, but steady progress, and there is evidence of an improving standard of commercial and domestic practice in this respect. 2 new legislation. Legislation during the year includes the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 and The Food and Drugs (Amendment) Act, 1954 both of which will add considerably to the duties of the department. Review of the housing accommodation in the District is already in hand with a view to providing the information required under the Housing Repairs & Rents Act by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in connection with demolition and clearance of slum properties. In view of the increase in population, this District took over from the Essex County Council their functions under the Shops Acts, with effect from ist April, 1954, and assumes the duties of a Food and Drugs Authority as from 1st April, 1955. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, and NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951. Five persons "in need of care and attention" were under observation for possible action under this section. Three of these cases remain at home under continued observation. One was admitted to hospital as a voluntary patient. One case was compulsorily removed to Heath Hospital, Tendring, under Section 47 of the 1948 Act. She is still an inmate, but compulsion is not now necessary. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and to the staff of the Public Health Department for their help and co-operation during the year. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Educational Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgments are also made. H. FRANKS, M.B., B.S., B.Hy., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA 1. (i) Water The water supply for the District is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board except for one house in the ownership of the Conservators of Epping Forest which is situated in the Forest a long way from the water mains supply. The supply of water which is piped has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. The number of houses is 15,522 and the estimated population at mid-year 57,780. Samples of water were taken as follows:— From wells 1 Satisfactory. From swimming baths 2 Fairly satisfactory. From ponds 2 Very inferior organic quality. No sewage contamination. Arrangements are to be made for the ponds to be cleaned out. (ii) Drainage and Sewerage The main works at Luxborough has operated satisfactorily during the year. New distributors to the filters were installed in the latter months and the process of recirculating effluent (eventually to be automatically controlled) has been commenced. The flow received at the works tends to be higher than expected and in conjunction with the possible new Southern Outfall sewer the screening and grit elimination arrangements, and the humus and digester capacity may need amendment or additions. The subsidiary works at Millers Lane, Chigwell Row, has been consistently satisfactory throughout the year. Five pumping plants, necessary to lift flow to gravity sewers at certain points in the district, have operated satisfactorily. The condition and capacity of some of the very old sewers is receiving consideration, especially in relation to the effects of new development and increased flow. There are indications that major schemes for relaying, with or without enlargement, may have to be contemplated during the next few years. 13 2. Rivers and Streams The River Roding flows through the centre of the Urban District dividing the Ward of Chigwell on the south-east from those of Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area which is under the jurisdiction of the Essex Rivers Board 3. (i) Closet Accommodation and Cesspools. Number of Cesspools and Septic Tanks: Buckhurst Hill 1 Chigwell 76 Loughton 11 Number of Earth or Chemical Closets in Houses: Chigwell 39 Loughton 6 Number of Chemical Closets in Caravans: Buckhurst Hill 3 Chigwell 13 Loughton 1 Premises served by earth closets, chemical closets and cesspools are in areas where no sewer is available. One house previously draining to a cesspool has been connected to the Council's sewer and every opportunity is taken to connect premises to main drainage. Several schemes are in hand with this in view. (ii) Public Cleansing Domestic refuse has continued to be collected once weekly from all premises in the District, by the Council's vehicles and manual staff. Six 10/12 cubic yard "Fordson/Eagle" covered lorries, each drawing a salvage trailer, are used together with part-time use of smaller covered vehicles for special collections. Another 10/12 c.yd. vehicle will be added to the fleet next year. Trade refuse has been collected at a fixed price per bin, allowing one bin free to each premises. This service has continued to be well used by local traders. Disposal of refuse has been by controlled tipping at a tip rented from a local contractor. A bulldozer is used for levelling and compacting the refuse, and to deposit and spread covering material, leaving minimum practical area exposed at any time. Measures are taken as necessary to prevent infestation by flies and vermin. 14 Salvage of paper and rags has been continued. During the year, 500 tons of paper and 7 tons of rags have been sorted, baled and sold. Kitchen waste has been collected only from schools and industrial canteens. During the year 160 tons have been taken to the Tottenham concentrator plant. Road gullies (in maintainable streets) have been emptied three times in the year. This is done under annual contract covering hire of vehicle with mechanical suction and re-sealing with clean water. (iii) Sanitary Inspection of the Area. An outline of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors is shown below: — Complaints received and dealt with 829 Inspections 7,261 Nuisances abated 367 Informal Notices served 67 Informal Notices complied with 66 Statutory Notices served 7 Statutory Notices complied with 21 Legal proceedings 5 15 Summary of Nuisances. Drains blocked or defective 166 Defective water closets 8 Defective water supply pipes 19 Nuisances from animals 7 Polluted di'tches, watercourses and ponds 9 Accumulation of refuse, etc. 14 Vermin (bugs and fleas) 3 Cellars flooded 8 Insect infestations, including flies 21 Cesspools overflowing or defective 1 Bees, wasps and hornets 128 Bats 3 (iv) Verminous Premises. 2 houses were found to be verminous during the year, one was infested with fleas and the other with bed bugs. One was a Chigwell Council house and the other a convalescent home which was presumed to have been infested by a patient. The number of houses found to be infested in 1951 was 19, 1952—12, in 1953—8, so that the present figures show a continuing and welcome decline. Houses were fumigated with "Fumite" and "Coopers Bed Bug Spray" with excellent results. Number of inspections and visits: 10. 16 RODENT CONTROL PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949. 1,308 inspections and visits were made in 1954, as against 1388 in 1952. This shows that the improvement reported last year is being maintained. Warfarin has been used with much success in treatment of infestations of both rats and mice. I think that the rat population is decreasing although we still receive many complaints. Warfarin is the main poison used in surface infestations. Zinc Phosphide or Arsenic is used in sewer treatments. The treatment of the Council's soil and surface water sewers was carried out twice during the year, the results are as follows:— March 1954 October 1954 Manholes baited 190 54 Pre-bait complete takes 8 11 Pre-bait part takes 5 27 Poison complete takes Nil 2 Poison part takes 5 11 Poison used Arsenic Zinc Phosphide 17 SECTION D.
