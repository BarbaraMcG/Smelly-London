Fletcher 2 TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF FINCHLEY September, 1949 I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1948. As a result of the National Health Service Act, 1946, certain services previously administered by the Borough Council were transferred to the County Council on the 5th July, but as there must still be a good deal of local interest in these services as well as in the School Health Service, I have considered it advisable to include certain information regarding them for the whole year. The vital statistics are satisfactory and the position regarding infectious diseases is good. There has been an increase in the number of cases of measles and whooping cough, but this is largely accounted for by the fact that there are many more children of a susceptible age in the Borough. Once again there has been no case of Diphtheria. The death rate from Tuberculosis is lower than it has ever been, but I have considered it necessary to utter a warning about the risk to the community arising from the lack of sanatorium beds. Housing conditions still give cause for anxiety. It is difficult to say whether overcrowding has been reduced or increased as we have no accurate knowledge of the extent of the problem. A fairly complete picture could only be obtained by a survey of the accommodation occupied by the applicants on the Council's housing list. The difficulty in getting work done to remedy sanitary defects has been aggravated by the raising of the limit of building repairs to houses from £10 to £100 per annum because builders can now keep their staff fully occupied with a better type of work. 3 Much attention has been given to the supervision of food and, in this connection, there has been close co-operation between the department and the Public Health Laboratory in an endeavour to improve the methods of handling food and the washing of crockery and utensils in canteens and restaurant kitchens. I wish to express my thanks to all members of the staff for their willing and total assistance throughout the year. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. A. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. 4 3 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,477 Population, 1948 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 70,960 Number of Inhabited Houses (end of 1948) 19,400 Rateable Value (1948) £907,007 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,725 Total Live Births 1,086 Birth Rate per 1,000 population 15.3 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England & Wales) 17.9 Total Stillbirths 21 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 18.97 Total Deaths 763 Death Rate per 1,000 population 10.75 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England & Wales) 10.8 Infant Deaths 30 Infant Mortality Rate 27.62 Infant Mortality Rate (England & Wales) 34 Maternal Deaths 2 Maternal Mortality Rate 1.8 Maternal Mortality Rate (England & Wale 1.02 Live Births : Males Females Total Legitimate 541 491 1,032 Illegitimate 22 32 54 563 523 1,086 Birth rate 15.3 per 1,000 estimated resident population.

(b) School Health Service (from 1st April, 1945). (a) Maternity and Child Welfare Infant Welfare Centres There are 4 Infant Welfare Centres at which 10 sessions are held weekly. Attendances of children Total Attendances Seen by Doctors Average Attendances per session Year Under 1 Over 1 1947 18,290 7,575 25,865 6,067 71 1948 17,530 10,632 28,162 6,232 63 Antenatal Clinic Four sessions are held each week at the Health Centre, Oak Lane. Seven hundred and thirty-four mothers attended the antenatal clinic in 1948 as compared with 882 in 1947. The number of women attending represented 66.3 per cent. of the total notified births. Year No. of expectant mothers attended No. of attendances 1947 882 4,226 1948 734 3,460 Domiciliary Midwifery There are 4 Municipal Midwives all of whom are trained in the administration of analgesia. During the year they attended 132 cases as Midwives and 23 as Maternity Nurses. 16 Maternity Accommodation The following table shows the known place of confinement of Finchley mothers in 1947 and 1948. 1947 1948 Private Homes in Finchley 315 193 Nursing Homes in Finchley 129 109 North Middlesex Hospital 243 260 Wellhouse Hospital 3 3 London Hospitals 245 241 Nursing Homes outside Finchlev 286 220 Private Homes outside Finchley 11 3 Hospitals outside London 66 22 1,298 1.051 Antenatal Exercises These exercises are conducted with a view to making confinements easier. During the year 12 mothers made 199 attendances. There can be little doubt that young mothers derive a good deal of confidence as a result of these exercises at a time when this is of great importance to them. Post-Natal Clinic This Clinic continued to serve a very useful purpose and the mothers attending for examination totalled 244 in 1948 as compared with 237 in 1947 and 164 in 1946. Sunlight Clinic During 1948, 106 children and 3 mothers received courses of ultra-violet radiation and made 1,132 attendances. Dental Treatment Dental treatment is provided at the Health Centre for children under 5 years of age and for expectant and nursing mothers. Four sessions per week are devoted to this work. 17 The following table shows the dental work carried out during 1947 and 1948.

Premature Infants and Illegitimate Children There has been no change in the arrangements for dealing with these children. During the year the deaths of 9 infants were attributed to prematurity. All the deaths took place in Institutions. 18 Adoption of Children Close co-operation is maintained with the Adoption Societies and the Court Officers. The homes are visited by the Health Visitors and reports are furnished on their suitability for the reception and care of a child. Child Life Protection At the end of the year there were 15 foster parents and 17 foster children on the register. These were visited throughout the year by the Health Visitors who act as Child Life Protection Visitors. Day Nurseries There are three day nurseries providing 140 places. There was a long waiting list at each nursery. The health of the children was exceptionally good throughout the year. The supply of nursery students has fallen off and staffing shortages have at times been somewhat acute. Domestic Helps The demand for helps has always been much in excess of the supply. At the end of the year the equivalent of 14 whole time helps were employed and help was provided in 427 households during the year. OrthopÆdic Clinic During 1948, 25 children received treatment at this clinic, and made 450 attendances. 19 Diphtheria Immunisation The following table shows the number of children immunised against Diphtheria during the past three years.

Scarlet Fever Scarlet Fever occurs in waves of about six years and in 1948 when there were 62 cases we had just about reached the bottom of a wave. It can therefore be anticipated that during the next few years there will be a gradual increase in the number of cases. The disease was mild in type, and there was no death. Poliomyelitis There were four cases of this disease which is commonly known by the unfortunate and misleading name of Infantile Paralysis. It is not by any means confined to infants and, in many cases, there is no paralysis. All the cases made good recoveries. 27 Measles There were S88 cases of measles which is the highest number since the disease became notifiable in 1939. The fact that there was no death although there were many severe cases is evidence of the resistance of the children and the medical and nursing care which they received. Whooping Cough The number of cases of whooping cough notified, 254, was higher than in any year since 1941. There was one death. Pneumonia Sixty cases of pneumonia were notified in 1948, and there were 28 deaths. Miscellaneous There was no case of Smallpox, Enteric Fever, or Cerebro Spinal Fever in 1948. Isolation Hospital The Joint Isolation Hospital at Coppetts Road, N.10, which has rendered such magnificent service to the Borough for many years passed from the Management of the Joint Committee to that of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board on the 5th July, 1948. This is a hospital with high traditions due in no small part to the fact that over a long period it has been ably administered by a local committee possessing extensive experience in the management of a hospital of this character. Bacteriological Work 28 INCIDENCE OF DIPHTHERIA FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1948. Positive Negative Throat/Nose Swabs Diphtheria Bacilli - 212 Haemolytic Streptococci 99 Vincent's Angina 2 Faeces Sonne Dysentery 7 62 Salmonella 9 Sputum T.B. Smear 19 68 Other Organisms 5 Whooping Cough Cough Plate — 19 Post-nasal Swab 4 145 361 Tuberculosis During 1948 63 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified comprising 37 males and 26 females, and 9 non-pulmonary cases, comprising 4 males and 5 females. There were 12 deaths from pulmonary and 5 from nonpulmonary tuberculosis making a total of 17 deaths from both forms of the disease. The death rate was 2.4 per 10,000 of the population, which is the lowest rate ever recorded. The shortage of hospital and sanatorium beds due to lack of staff makes it necessary for many patients to be kept at home under conditions which cannot be said to be satisfactory either for the treatment of the patients themselves or for the prevention of the spread of the disease to others. If this state of affairs goes on for any length of time an increase in the number of cases of tuberculosis must be expected. 31 The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years: Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F 1939 34 30 6 8 16 7 2 — 1940 28 21 4 4 16 10 2 2 1941 34 38 5 7 18 15 2 1 1942 40 39 4 3 14 19 1 1 1943 41 39 7 5 14 11 3 5 1944 48 30 8 8 14 9 3 2 1945 49 41 8 1 17 9 5 1 1946 43 26 2 8 14 9 1 2 1947 54 36 1 4 18 9 2 — 1948 37 26 4 5 5 7 3 2 HOUSING Statistics— 1948 1.

These premises were demolished during the year. 21 and 23 Granville Road, N.12 The works of repair necessary to render the above houses fit for human habitation were carried out by the Owner in accordance with undertakings accepted by the Council. 2 Granville Road, N.12 A Demolition Order was made in connection with this house towards the end of the year and an offer made by the Owners on behalf of a prospective purchaser to render the house fit was being considered by the Council. Application had been made to the County Court to rescind the Demolition Order with a view to the undertaking being accepted. 357 Regents Park Road, N.3 These premises, comprising business and living accommodation, were found to be dangerous and incapable of being repaired at reasonable cost. Representation was made with a view to closing the portion used for human habitation. 7 The Mall, Ballards Lane, N.3 The above house was found to be unfit for habitation and upon representation to the owners the house was rendered fit and modernised, without resort to formal proceedings. 36 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work dealt with by your Sanitary Inspectors during the year 1948. Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 13,975. At 1,000 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 3,581 were discovered, and at the end of the year 3,022 including a number outstanding at the end of 1947, had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 384 was in hand and 2,451 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied 982 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. As from the 1st July the free limit for building repairs on dwelling houses was raised from £10 to £100. The effect of this was a considerable reduction in the number of licences issued by this department, 892 being issued in 1948 as against 1,664 in 1947. Also, greater difficulty was experienced in getting builders to carry out work in connection with sanitary notices, as the increase in the limit allowed them far greater scope to select belter class work. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out : Inspections under Housing Acts 15 Special Inspections 3,011 Reinspections 2,883 Inspections of Works in Progress 982 Inspections of Factories, Workshops and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 412 37 Visits to Slaughterhouses 9 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 19 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 66 Inspections of Meat, Fish and other Food Shops 576 Inspections of Shops (Shops Acts) 10 Visits re Infectious Disease and Verminous Premises 638 Visits re Rodent Control 3,560 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 295 Visits re Building Licences 771 Visits re Hawkers 54 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 3 Miscellaneous 671 13,975 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Number of houses and premises re-drained 2 Repairs or amendments to existing drains 57 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 123 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 569 Manholes provided 23 Manholes repaired 45 Intercepting traps fixed 3 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 20 New gully traps fixed 26 Gully curbs provided or repaired 37 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 3 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 25 Water tests applied 104 Smoke tests applied 6 Air tests applied 1 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C.

Notices Served Informal notices 949 Statutory notices 31 Enquiries—Outstanding Sanitary Notices One thousand three hundred and eighteen letters were received during the year from the Town Clerk enquiring whether or not there were any outstanding sanitary notices with respect to certain properties in the district. The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 167 Verminous rooms disinfested 104 Number of articles disinfected 1,529 Number of verminous premises dealt with 57 Six hundred and thirty-eight visits were made by your inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. 40 The number of houses found to be infested with bugs and disinfested during 1948 was as follows: Council houses — Other houses 36 Insecticides containing D.D.T. were employed in treating bug infested houses. When necessary wall and/or ceiling paper is stripped off and mouldings, skirtings, etc., are eased or removed. Bedding and similar articles are removed and subjected to steam disinfection. The houses occupied by persons about to remove to Council dwellings are examined by the Housing Manager or one of the Sanitary Inspectors and any infested articles therein are either disinfested or destroyed. The houses which have been disinfested are revisited in order to ascertain whether or not further treatment is necessary, and the tenants are requested to co-operate with the department by keeping their houses in a cleanly state and reporting any reappearance of bugs. Since the introduction and use of D.D.T. the need for repeated disinfestation has been less frequent. An increase in the number of houses infested with ants has occurred during the year, 16 cases having been dealt with. Only three cases of fleas were dealt with. Houses Let in Lodgings During the year one addition was made to the Register of Houses let in lodgings. The number of registered premises in the Borough is now 76. Common Lodging Houses There are no common lodging houses in the Borough. Sanitary Conveniences There are 24 conveniences attached to licensed houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 12 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in Recreation Grounds. Eleven of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and 1 accommodation for males only. 41 Complaints One thousand five hundred and seventy-nine complaints were received with reference to the following, matters, viz.: Blocked or defective drains 134 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 603 Defective roofs 79 Non-removal of refuse 3 Verminous condition of houses 10 Nuisances from dampness 55 Overcrowding 145 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 11 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 3 Accumulations of refuse or manure 44 Absence of, or defective dustbins 21 Smoke nuisances 10 Premises infested with rats or mice 275 Premises infested with insects 17 Flooding 13 Noise 6 Wasps nests 52 Nuisances from pig bins 2 Water Supply. 10 Unsound Food 26 Other complaints 60 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of complaint. Places of Public Entertainment In accordance with the request of the Minister of Health contained in Circular 120, the cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. The defects discovered as a result of these inspections were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible. Eighteen premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council, which is the licensing authority. 42 Premises Periodically Inspected The following premises were visited periodically during the year and any matters found requiring attention were dealt with: Description of Premises No. in Borough Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops 25 Factories, Workshops and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 371 Fried Fish Shops 7 Ice Cream Premises 78 Places of Public Entertainment 18 Public House Conveniences 24 Slaughterhouses 4 Food Shops 198 725 43 Factory Act, 1937 1.

In one instance nuisance from the emission of black smoke was traced to a defect in the mechanical stoker. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and food preparing premises has received the special attention of the sanitary inspectors. 46 A survey of a number of food kitchens in the area was made in conjunction with Dr. Hobbs of the. Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, to investigate the methods employed in washing up, the provision of suitable and sufficient sinks and hot water supply, W.C. accommodation and personal hygiene. Samples and swabs were taken for bacteriological examination from washing up water, towels, cups, plates, spoons and forks, and the results tabulated and used as very tangible evidence of the need for effecting improvements. It is considered that a minimum of two sinks are necessary for efficient washing up, and a number of food kitchens have accordingly been so equipped. There has been a substantial increase in the hawking of foodstuffs, especially fruit and vegetables, and 14 new registrations were granted during the year. Many of the new hawkers are "barrow boys" and live outside the Borough. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked up where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. In one case, registration was refused in connection with the proposed sale of jellied eels from a stall. Eight hundred and sixty-nine visits have been made by vour inspectors to various food premises. The list of food condemned is shown below. Four private slaughterhouses are licensed and occasionally slaughtering is carried on at one of them on permit from the Food Office. 47 UNSOUND FOOD, 1948 Tuberculosis Bovines 52 lbs.

Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, all animals, including sheep, slaughtered in a slaughterhouse within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. The number of persons licensed under the Act during 1948 was 2. 50 Butchers' Shops There are 48 butchers' shops in the Borough. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. These premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc. have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 30. At 25 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by your inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical limewashing of these premises, as required by statute, has been carried out. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 25 dairies, cowsheds and milkshops in the Borough. There were no new registrations of milk purveyors during the year. Inspections of all dairy premises have been maintained and the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926 with respect to the cleanliness of dairies and cowsheds, the protection of milk against infection and contamination, and the conveyance and distribution of milk have been generally well observed. The veterinary inspection of the cows kept in the Borough is carried out by the Middlesex County Council. The Milk (Special Designations) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1948, as follows : Dealers' licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 8 „ „ „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 14 Supplementary licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested — „ „ „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 3 51 Licence in respect of establishment at which Tuberculin Tested milk is bottled 1 Licences in respect of establishments in which the process of pasteurising milk is carried on 2 Two samples of Tuberculin Tested and three of Pasteurised milk were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination. These samples complied with the prescribed conditions. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1947 control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only three persons make ice cream within the Borough, one manufacturing by the heat treatment method and two using proprietary powders known as "complete cold mix" which only require the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. There are 78 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Twelve samples were taken during the year. Coffee Stalls The number of coffee stalls in the Borough is two. Both are situated on the main roads. They are visited at intervals and action is taken to secure the provision of a satisfactory water supply, suitable means of food storage, cleanliness of stalls and utensils and proper means for the storage and disposal of refuse. Fish Friers In accordance with the provisions of Section 107 of the Public Health Act, 1936, fish frying has ceased to be an offensive trade within the Borough. This business is established at 7 premises, one new one being opened during the year. Game Licences Seventeen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. 52 The Shops Acts, 1912-1936 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to the shops on the Register are as follows : Number on register at beginning of 1948 843 Number closed 3 New shops 26 No. on register at end of 1948 866 Changes of occupancy 13 Infringements recorded — Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances : (1) A retailer was summonsed for selling vinegar in a dirty bottle. The defendant thereupon summonsed the wholesaler who in turn summonsed the manufacturer. The defendant was fined £5 and £2 2s. costs and the wholesaler £10 and £10 10s. costs. (2) A retailer was summonsed for selling a loaf of bread containing tin tacks, and he summonsed the baker who manufactured the bread. The case was dismissed, the defendants being awarded £6 6s. costs. Swimming Pools A considerable advance in the purification of bath water has been made by the introduction of "Break Point Chlorination", and Finchley was one of the first places to adopt this method.
