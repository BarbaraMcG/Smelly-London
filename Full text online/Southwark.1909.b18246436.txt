Sou 33 Borough of Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health, FOR THE YEAR l9O9. G B. Millson, Medical Officer of Health. BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my Twenty-Third Annual Report, which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1909. The death-rate is much the same as last year, and the regular decline in the birth-rate continues. There has been an extremely small amount of notifiable disease, and of infectious disease generally, during the year. There were five cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever notified, with three deaths. I am glad to be able to report that the year has been a healthy one, and that the Infant Mortality was never so low, the rate being 119 per 1000 births. We are certainly making good progress in the lowering of this Infant rate. All the important matters of sanitation have been during the year pushed forward. Infants from birth have been visited and the homes examined. The Staff has done excellent work. I have again to thank the Council and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. TABLE OF CONTENTS. PAGE.

For some years past in my Annual Report I have recorded the changes that are taking place in the Borough by the desire of all persons who in any way can afford it, to take their families to the suburbs. This migration still continues, and has been active during the past year. One can understand the immense difference between the life of a family in a "flat" dwelling in the crowded portion of our Borough, and that of a family in the suburbs where the house with a small garden is separately occupied. Our "block" dwellings are feeling acutely this change, and I am sure that in the near future these buildings will become more and more difficult to let. Within the last year the leases of a large number of small houses have fallen in, and the property has reverted to the freeholder. In such cases it is extremely difficult for the owners to decide what is best to be done ; whether to pull down the property and erect other dwelling houses, to patch up the existing worn-out houses, or to erect other buildings on the site. I am satisfied, however, that in the inner portion of the Borough it is not to the interest of ground landlords to build small houses as we appear even at the preseut time to have enough of them. The salvation of the Borough is for it to become more and more, both in buildings and business, like to the City. The proximity of much of our Borough to the City, and the comparative cheapness of the land, should induce property owners as far as possible to make it easy for the City to extend in our direction. I think in the past few years the erection of warehouses has proceeded very satisfactorily in the district, and with a better means of communication across the river we may expect to see a greater extension of such premises, which many of us think would be for the benefit of the Borough. It would certainly remove the squalid areas which have so befouled the ancient name of Southwark. Much of the sanitary work of our Borough is " bludgeon " in character. It consists largely in the cleansing of dirty and verminous premises. This is a highly necessary work and a large quantity has been done during the past year. Only those acquainted with such work can have any idea of the verminous condition of many of the houses of the Borough, and the unfortunate conditions under which the inhabitants live. One hears the opinion expressed, even by persons engaged in the work, that the sanitary staff is too large and could be much reduced. Such expressions of 7 opinion would be amusing if the circumstances were not so grave. Instead of a diminution of the sanitary staff being required we need an increase of it. I sometimes think it cannot be understood how little the sanitary staff costs the Borough. When everything is totalled up, the expenses of the whole staff of the Public Health Department are defrayed by a rate of a penny in the £, which I think no one can call other than extremely reasonable. During the year a large number of verminous school children have been cleansed. In every case the homes were visited and the bedding and rooms, where necessary, cleansed and fumigated. Our bathing station is an insignificant one in size, but it is capable of getting through a great amount of work. The staff is capable of dealing readily with 30 children a day.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1909 was 5,720, of which 2,918 were males, and 2,802 females. This represents a birth-rate of 27.1 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births belonging to the individual parishes was as follows Newington, 3,452; St. George the Martyr, 1,718; Christchurch, 240; and St. Saviour's, 310. In addition to the 5,720 births registered in the Borough I learn from the Registrar General that there were 249 births during the year in various lying-in institutions outside the Borough belonging to persons 9 resident in Southwark, and this number (249) must be added to the total as above, making the actual number of births for the year 5,969, which increases the birth-rate to 28.3 per 1,000. As the addresses in relation to these 249 births have not been communicated to me I am unable to allot them to their respective wards or districts.

Of the 2,997 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 1,034 occurred in the Poor-Law institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 370 belonging to Southwark, and 664 to other boroughs of the metropolis. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home— that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,195. Of this very large number as many as 710 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died at the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 33.8. "When those persons who were non-parishioners, but who died in outBorough have been deducted, and the out-lying deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the Sanitary Area is found to be 3,528, of which number 1,878 were males, and 1,650 females. The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 16.7 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1909, as against a rate of 16.3 for 1908. TABLE 3.

Two cases of this disease were notified during the year 1909. (1) H. L., aged 24, Barman, engaged at a tavern in the city. The source of the disease was traced by the Medical Officer of the City. His home in our borough was disinfected and the contacts were re-vaccinated. No further spread of the disease from the home took place. (2) D. P., aged 22 years, Kitchen Porter. This case was found, after a residence of ten days in the hospital, not to be suffering from the disease, and was discharged. Deaths from Small-pox during the last ten years:— 1900 — 1905 — 1901 11 1906 — 1902 78 1907 — 1903 — 1908 — 1904 1 1909 — SCARLET FEVER. The deaths from Scarlet Fever in the borough were 14 during 1909, as against 24, 35, 45, 28 and 12 for the preceding five years. This cycle of five years, which is the usual cyclical period of the disease in this borough, has been marked by a diminution of one-third of the number of the cases when compared with those of the previous period of five years. There has likewise been a smaller death-rate on the number of cases notified. This condition must be considered as highly satisfactory. The cases have been spread pretty evenly over the district, and nothing in the form of an outbreak has occurred. If the disease takes its usual course the lowest point of the cycle was reached this year, and we may therefore look to a rise next year. I trust, however, the recent improvement may continue. Every case has been carefully inquired into, and a full statement of all contacts sent on to all those interested and concerned in the matter. The total number of cases notified was 590, as against 775 for 1908. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 2.0. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.07. 56 The number of ca8es notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The deaths in the 583 cases sent to hospital numbered 13, a mortality of 2.2 per cent. as against 3.0 per cent for last year. In the 7 cases treated at home, there was one death, a mortality of 14 .3 per cent. It is our practice to spray the room well with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. DIPHTHERIA. There has been a small amount of this disease occurring in the Borough during the year under consideration. The fouling of the sub.soil in the low.lying parts, by sewage, after heavy storms, has not been so much as in former years, yet many cases have been reported where extensive flooding of basements has taken place. Matters are improving in this respect, and I feel sure that, when this fouling of the sub.soil has been reduced to a minimum by the provision of more sewers, Diphtheria in Southwark will be very little seen. No outbreak of any importance has occurred which needs mentioning. 57 The deaths from the disease numbered 33, as against 32 for the year 1909. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 256 for this year, and 270 for the preceding one. The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 12.9. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 016. The number of cases notified, as compared with Loudon, during the last ten years was :— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark.

The Wards most affected were St. Michael's, St. George's, St. Mary's and All Saints', in the order named. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year numbered 6, as against 7, 11, 12, in the preceding three years. The total number of cases notified was 35 for the present year, and 48, 80 and 111 for the preceding three years. 58 Our inhabitants dearly love mussels and cockles; the history of many of the cases clearly points to those delicacies as the cause of the complaint. The partial cooking these shell fish are subjected to does not, evidently, kill the special organism. The percentage of deaths to the total number notified was 171. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.03. The deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years :— 1900 39 1905 11 1901 18 1906 12 1902 23 1907 11 1903 23 1908 7 1904 18 1909 6 The number of cases notified during the last ten years:— 1900 307 1905 74 1901 135 1906 111 1902 193 1907 80 1903 122 1908 48 1904 92 1909 35 Of the 35 cases notified as many as 31 were removed to hospital, of which 6 died, a mortality of 19 3 per cent. In the 4 cases treated at home none died. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 88.5. DIARRHEA. There has been a considerable fall from last year in the number of cases of Diarrhæa. The coldness of the summer had much to do with this decline. The practice of visiting all houses at which a birth has occurred, and the urging of all mothers, when that is possible, to breastfeed the infant must have had some effect upon the disease. A pretty satisfactory supervision of infants up to twelve months of age, has been carried out in four of the Wards, and this work we hope to extend, as quickly as possible, to the other parts of the Borough. In this work we can estimate the migratory habits of the people. It is astonishing how much the families move from house to house, not only in the Borough 59 itself, but also into other boroughs. Not more than fifty per cent. of the infants born in the Borough remain until they are twelve months old in the same house. The annual death-rate from Diarrhæa per 1,000 living was 0.53. Deaths from diarrhæa during the last ten years :— 1900 233 1905 183 1901 222 1906 225 1902 169 1907 101 1903 197 1908 188 1904 282 1909 113 TYPHUS FEVER. No death occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified, MEASLES. The deaths from Measles during the year numbered 127, as against 77, 112, and 95 for the previous three years. The death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.60. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years: — 1900 116 1905 154 1901 161 1906 95 1902 164 1907 112 1903 83 1908 77 1904 191 1909 127 The Wards mostly affected were St. George's, St. Michael's and All Saints', in the order named. The cases of Measles reported to the Medical Officer of Health from the Schools numbered 833. There must have been in the whole Borough at least 1,600 more cases not reported to us. WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from this disease were 57 for this year and 50 for 1908. The Wards most affected were St. Michael's, Trinity and St. George's. 60 The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.27. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ten years:— 1900 120 1905 80 1901 98 1906 54 1902 114 1907 103 1903 68 1908 50 1904 118 1909 57 438 cases of Whooping Cough were notified to the Medical Officer of Health from the Schools. CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. During the year five cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified, of which three died. CHICKEN-POX. During the year 477 cases of Chicken Pox were notified to the Medical Officer of Health from the Schools. PHTHISIS. The total number of Phthisis cases notified during the year was 644, of which 165 were voluntary, and 479 were Poor Law cases. Of the 165 voluntary cases 33 were notified from Brompton Hospital, 4 from Guy's Hospital and 4 from St. Margaret's Hospital. The number of voluntary notifications, both from medical practitioners and hospitals is very unsatisfactory, considering that there must be at least 2,500 cases in the Borough not notified to the Medical Officer, and in no way supervised by the Health Department. On receipt of a notification of Phthisis the house is visited and inspected, and every person connected with the patient examined. Periodic disinfection is also carried out at short intervals. The Council decided at the end of the year to have allotted for Southwark patients five beds in a sanatorium. Arrangements have since been made for five beds at the Benenden Sanatorium in Kent, belonging to the National Association for providing Sanatoria for Tuberculosis. In the notification of Poor Law cases it has been remarkable tha not a single complaint has been received in regard either to the periodic 61 disinfection or to visits made to the cases. The patients appear to have realised that what has been done has been entirely for their benefit, and I think that an extension of this notification could well be made in the direction of all hospital and dispensary patients before compulsory notification of private persons is decided upon.

The Public Health Committee brought the following report before the Council when it was recommended:— (a) That the principle of the Council providing accommodation at Sanatoria for persons suffering from the early stages of Phthisis be adopted. (b) That the matter be referred back to the Public Health Committee to make enquiries from suitable Sanatoria as to the provision of five beds for initial cases of Phthisis in the Borough. Both recommendations were adopted. Report made to Council by Public Health Committee : — "That in connection with the voluntary notification of Phthisis, the question of providing accommodation at Sanatoria for persons suffering from the disease be referred to the Public Health and Sanitary Committee for consideration and report." The Medical Officer of Health reports that in the Memorandum of the Medical Officers of Health of the Local Government Board on Administrative Measures against Tuberculosis great importance is attached by him to educational methods. He advises that where the home treatment has been found insufficient to cure the patient, Sanatorium treatment, on educational grounds alone, should be carried out and the patient should be sent away, even for a short period, for sanatorium discipline and instruction. Anyone acquainted with the nature of Phthisis must strongly agree with what has been stated, not only for the benefit of the patient himself, but to prevent others from becoming infected with the disease. Under Section 75 of the Public Health (Londou) Act, 1891, " any Sanitary Authority have power to enter into any agreement with any person having the management of any hospital for the reception of the sick inhabitants of their district, on payment of such annual or other sum as may be agreed on," and further, in Section 78 of the same Act there is provision for the conveyance of infected persons to hospital or other place of destination. It will be seen, therefore, that our Council have power to enter into an agreement with the authorities of a sanatorium to have sent for treatment any inhabitant of their district suffering from Consumption. 64 In a district such as Southwark the majority of the persons affe cted by the Phthisis are of the working class, and owing in many cases to the limited accommodation that can be provided for the family, there is great danger of the disease being conveyed to the other members. It is only by rigid precautions being taken that the disease can be confined to the patient originally affected. It is very satisfactory at the present time to know that a great many agencies are at work in the Borough, having for their object the amelioration of the conditions under which many of the people in our district live. Even in the last eight years these agencies must have been instrumental in lowering the total number of deaths from Phthisis. There has been since 1901 a material decrease in the number of deaths from this disease. In that year for the whole Borough the number was 516. In 1902, 550; in 1903, 496; in 1904, 499; in 1905, 443; in 1906, 429; in 1907, 425 ; and in 1908, 403. It is considered that at the very least, six times the number of persons who have died in the year are affected by the complaint, and many place the figure as high as ten times. On that estimation we should have in Southwark upwards of 4,000 persons suffering from Phthisis at the present time. Southwark suffers more than other districts by the large number of common lodging houses in the Borough, by the casual nature of the employment of many of its inhabitants and the consequent poverty, and by the severe struggle for existence seen around us. By the voluntary notification of Phthisis, which is steadily increasing, disinfection and other preventive methods have been carried out during the last few years. The Woolwich Borough Council have had beds in the Maitland Cottage Sanatorium, Peppard, Oxfordshire, for the last six years. They maintain seven beds there at the present time. The annual cost to that Council is £78 per bed, and in the various reports of their Medical Officer of Health he expresses himself as very satisfied with the good that has been done to those who have been treated in the Sanatorium. More recently Westminster City Council have maintained a certain number of beds in the same Sanatorium, and in a similar manner they are satisfied with what has been done. There are many other Sanatoria throughout England to which patients can be sent. 65 Your Committee are informed that the approximate annual cost for each bed in a Sanatorium would be £70. As the Council are aware Phthisis cases are notified voluntarily, disinfection and such other preventive methods as are possible are carried on, but nothing of a practical nature is being done by the Council to deal with the cases themselves as they arise. It may be pointed out, in the event of the Council deciding to adopt the principle under consideration, that only cases in the first stage of the disease would be dealt with and as far as possible preference would be given to males. A suitable case, for instance, would be that of a young man with a young family, in the early stage of the disease, where a few months treatment at a Sanatorium would perhaps restore him to health, while at the same time he would be trained in the general hygienic regulations of his life in a practical manner that would be scarcely possible in his home. Your Committee feel that Southwark, having regard to the large number of Phthisis cases annually notified, should follow the example of other Borough Councils, including Woolwich and Westminster, in securing accommodation for initial cases of Phthisis in Sanatoria free from the disadvantages of the Poor Law.

The total number of rooms treated during the year by the Council's disinfecting staff was 4,829. Of this number 1,198 rooms were disinfected after the occurrence of the ordinary notifiable infectious diseases, as against 1,389 rooms in 1908. 2,534 rooms were periodically sprayed and otherwise treated in connection with cases of Phthisis notified voluntarily or under the Tuberculosis Regulations of 1908. 1,097 verminous rooms were sulphured and otherwise cleansed by the Council's staff during the year. Of the total number of rooms disinfected (4,829) it was found necessary to strip 923 rooms. Of these 639 were in relation to the notifiable diseases, 235 after the termination of cases of Phthisis, and 49 were verminous. TABLE 35. The Locality of Rooms Disinfected.

The Public Health Committee considered a letter from the London County Council in which they desired to know whether Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays would be convenient days for verminous children from the Schools to attend at the Southwark Cleansing Station, within certain hours, viz.: from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, and 2 to 4 p.m,, and to accept from the London County Council a capitation payment of 2s. The London County Council also desired to know whether the female children would be properly supervised by a female attendant, also whether there was a separate entrance to the Station, and its position such as to prevent the contraction of infectious illness. The Public Health Committee replied that the capitation grant of 2s. would be accepted, and that 30 children, under proper supervision each day could be cleansed on the three days named in the week, and that the entrance to the cleansing station was far enough away from the Reception House as to remove any possibility of infection from "contacts " from time to time housed there. There was also a further letter from the London County Council asking whether verminous persons from Common Lodging Houses in the Borough could be cleansed at the Cleansing Station, and in the event of other boroughs not having the accommodation could any lodging house inmate belonging to another borough be cleansed at the Southwark Station ? The Public Health Committee replied that they were quite able and willing to cleanse all verminous persons in the Borough, but could not engage to cleanse persons occupying lodging houses outside. Up to the present time no demand for payment has been made by this Council, although from time to time various sums have been mentioned which would cover the cost of the work. The Act places the responsibility for cleansing children on the London County Council, but the Medical Officer of Health was strongly of opinion that whether paid for by the London County Council or not, this work should be done by the Borough Council, as it gives the Borough Council an opportunity of cleansing and disinfecting the rooms at the time the children are attended to. When attempts have been made by the London County Council to cleanse the children at temporary stations near the schools this simultaneous and efficient cleansing and disinfection of the home and bedding was found impossible. It has been suggested that the cleansing of verminous children and rooms should be a charge on the Borough similar to that when infectious disease occurs, and the more this opinion is considered the more it seems a common-sense way of dealing with the subject, although it would be a very heavy charge upon the poorer districts. 71 Verminous Persons Cleansed during 1909. 2435 persons were cleansed during the year at the Bathing Station, as against 1641 persons during 1908. Of this number, 111 were persons (adults) applying under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. The officials of the London County Council (Education) caused 2305 children to be sent from the various schools to the Bathing Station for treatment, as against 1602 children during 1908. The following table shows the schools from which the children came. TABLE 40.

GRIFFITHS u. WEATHERITT (Southwark Borough Council). Provision of a water supply to the upper storeys of a house under Section 78 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. Be 18, Olney Street. A summons in this case was issued at the express instructions of the Public Health Committee after some of the members had visited the premises. The proceedings before the magistrate on the 17th December, 1909, were taken under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Section 78 of the L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1907, to require the provision of a proper and sufficient water supply to the upper floors of 18, Olney Street. The premises are technically a tenemented house occupied by two separate families, the family without a supply of water being on the top floor. There are three storeys, the lowest one being a half basement. The existing supply of water is from two taps, one in the yard and the other in a washhouse in the yard. At the hearing at the Lambeth Police Court the magistrate (Mr. Chapman) made an order on the Owner, who duly appeared, to provide the supply of water as asked for. The Owner immediately appealed to the Quarter Sessions. At the hearing at the Sessions, on January 7th, 1910, the Bench unanimously dismissed the Appeal, and upheld the magistrate's Order with costs. Evidence was given, on behalf of the Borough Council, by Dr. Hamer, one of the London County Council Medical Officers, and Dr. Millson, Medical Officer of Health for Southwark, to the effect that the occupants of the top floor rooms had to come down twenty-five steps to fetch up their water, and it then had to be stored in a bucket in the room in which persons lived and slept. On examination the water was found to be polluted by bird manure, seeds and other substances. Owing to the difficulty of carrying up the water it was found that the family used only three bucketfuls a day for all purposes, when they should have used at least eighteen bucketfuls, which is the acknowledged quantity required for such a family. It was contended, therefore, that the supply of water, owing to the difficulty of carrying it upstairs, was so restricted as to be insufficient for the maintenance of the health of the family The Bench unanimously dismissed the Appeal, and upheld the magistrate's Order with costs. Mr. Campion appeared for the Appellant and Mr. Frank Dodd for the Borough Council. 105 WATER SUPPLY. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891, Section 48.

Our operations in regard to these nuisances have not been attended throughout the year with the greatest success. Many complaints have been received from various sources of black smoke issuing from shafts in the Borough, especially from those in connection with the City of London Electric Lighting Station and the Borough of Southwark Electric Lighting Station. At the request of the Public Health Committee two Sanitary Inspectors were engaged for nearly a month in watching the shafts on the river bank, and every case of smoking was tabulated in the report. The following portion of the report gives the substance of what was done:— "To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, Inspectors Nicholson and Fisher have been engaged, from the 13th of April to the 12th of May, 1909 (holidays excepted) for a period of 22 days, watching for black smoke issuing from the chimney-shafts near the river bank. Sections 23 and 24 of the Public Health (London) Act relate to smoke. Sub-section (b) of Section 24 states that any chimney (not being a chimney of a private dwelling house) sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance shall be a nuisance liable to the penalty contained in SectioD 23, viz., a sum not exceeding five pounds, and on a second conviction to a fine of ten pounds, and on each subsequent conviction to a fine double the amount of the fine imposed on the last preceding conviction. The customary definition of a nuisance is that black smoke must be seen to issue from a shaft for a continuous period of five minutes, or if in shorter peri'ods, then for ten minutes in the hour. In this report no notice has been taken of black smoke issuing for a less period than one minute, although in the case of the shaft of the Thames Grain Drying Wharf, which is a great offender for thirty or forty seconds at a time, these short periods amount to a good deal in the day. The observations extended usually from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day. The City of London Electric Lighting Station will be seen to have had a good deal of smoke at irregular periods sent out of each 107 of their shafts during the time of observation. The South shaft was the worst, next the North shaft, and lastly the middle shaft. During the period covered by the report black smoke issued for 294 minutes from the South shaft, for 270 minutes from the North shaft, and for 203 minutes from the middle shaft. This would be respectively 13, 12 and 9 minutes per day of 7 hours. The Thames Grain Drying Wharf is the next largest offender with 124 minutes, making nearly 6 minutes per day. In this amount is not reckoned portions of a minute, which were very numerous with this particular shaft. The next in amount was Younghusband, Barnes and Company's premises for a period of 66 minutes, i.e., 3 minutes per day; and the remainder, with the exception of Messrs. Barclay, Perkins' premises, were for periods varying from 22 to 33 minutes, i.e., from 1 to 1½ minutes per day. The least offender was Messrs. Barclay, Perkins' shaft, which only sent out black smoke for a period of 7 minutes, i.e. one-third of a minute per day. The longest time continuous smoke was seen to issue was on April 22nd from the North shaft of the City of London Electric Lighting Station, and was for a period of 43 minutes. It will be seen that the average quantity of black smoke issuing during the whole period was not distinctly excessive, but when the periods of smoking are taken into consideration, many of these must be considered distinctly excessive and must have been a serious nuisance to the neighbourhood. For many days the various shafts of the City of London Electric Lighting Company behaved very well there being little or no black smoke sent out on occasions for the whole day, whereas on other days the smoking was distinctly bad. This would point to carelessness in stoking, which with care ought to be prevented. Notices have been served on the various Companies where the extent of the black smoke was beyond the periods mentioned in my report. On the 21st of April the Coal Smoke Abatement Society reported black smoke for 30 minutes, from 12.55 to 1.25, foom the shafts of the City of London Electric Lighting Station, which complaint agrees pretty accurately with our inspectors' report. 108 In the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, now before Parliament, in Part IV. an endeavour is made to take out the word "black" in regard to smoke, in Section 24, Sub-section (b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. I am strongly of opinion that on health grounds the provisions proposed should become law. In recent years for house purposes, such as heating and cooking, gas has replaced, to a large extent, coal fires, and, in that respect, there must have been less smoke produced and less emitted from private chimneys. I also think that upon the whole there has been some improvement in regard to smoke issuing from the chimneys of manufactories and other works. There is, however, at the present time a large amount of smoke given off which, under good management and the use of better materials, might be in a large measure avoided. The smoke does a great damage to health, chiefly by obscuring sunlight and allowing lower organisms to grow. It also increases in severity, if it does not originate, lung diseases. Many of the manufactories in Southwark, which years ago were such great offenders in the way of smoke have, by the re-arrangement of their furnaces and the adoption of an almost smokeless coal, ceased to give off smoke except in small quantities. Unfortunately, there are still many manufactories and works which on account of expense, use an inferior coal, and so go on day by day darkening the atmosphere with volumes of smoke. The smoke nuisance in Southwark is remediable. It is simply a question of expense and care in the way of supervision. This has been proved over and over again, for where firms have been threatened with prosecution they have used a better coal and have exercised better supervision, with the result that there has been no further cause of complaint. The great difficulty in regard to prosecutions has been the definition of "black smoke." It is rarely, if ever, that a volume of smoke however dark and dense it may be issuing from a chimney shaft can have the word "black" correctly applied to it. We have tried to get over 109 the difficulty in the definition of black smoke by saying that it was so dense as to effectually obscure the top of the chimney. That evidence in many cases enabled the magistrate to convict. I think, however, that had the defendant been supported by better technical evidence the magistrate would not have been able to arrive at the opinion that the case in regard to "black smoke" was sufficiently proved. The blackness or darkness of smoke largely depends on the position from which you view it. On a dull day viewed from the top of a building considerably above ground level and against a darkened background the smoke would appear many degrees darker than when viewed on a fine sunny day, the observer being on the ground level with the sky as a background. Sanitary officers in giving evidence generally state that in addition to the top of the shaft being obscured the blackness of the smoke was of the colour of something decidedly black such as a black hat, which is a familiar expression, but I question whether such blackness in reality can ever exist. Smoke proved to be in any way short of this definite blackness must tell seriously against a conviction. To obviate this dark colour of smoke the exhaust steam is sometimes turned into the shaft, and this materially lightens the colour of the smoke. The quantity of black smoke emitted from a chimney is no measure of the amount of smoke generally given off by chimney shafts. Some firms who seriously charge the atmosphere around their works with smoke give off from their chimney shafts only brown smoke. This, however, is almost as much sun obscuring as black smoke. The absolutely worst offender in the Borough is a shaft from a public concern which consistently smokes all day with very small intervals, but, owing to the exhaust steam, it is seldom that the volume of smoke is entirely black. The difficulty in getting convictions, especially since the Chelsea case, has been such as to make it necessary to have strong confirmatory evidence before the prosecutions are entered upon. This entails constant observations, and the expense of employing in smoke observations a number of inspectors, together with the indisposition on the part of many of the Councillors of the Local Authority to prosecute ratepayers has made prosecutions almost impossible. 110 I contend that there has been such an improvement in all kinds of smoke from many important factories that it is quite possible to prevent excessive smoking, of whatever colour. In fact, many present offenders in the way of smoke by better furnace construction, better supervision, and the use of better fuel could prevent much of the smoke which is now being discharged into the atmosphere.

During the absence from their wards of these two inspectors, the work was carried on by Inspector Rugg and Inspector Goodfellow respectively. The loss of inspector power in regard to the four wards concerned, i.e., St. Mary's, St. Paul's, St. Peter's and All Saints is equivalent to a diminution of 12 per cent. of the number of inspections usually made in the year in these particular wards. 136 137 TABLE 65.

(late Gun Street Dwellings). The condition of these dwellings has been very unsatisfactory for some time past. Complaints have been made from time to time of the low class of tenants occupying them, and the generally dilapidated condition of the tenements. The ward sanitary inspector has had them constantly under his attention and innumerable notices have been served, many of them ending in Police Court proceedings. The following report was made to the Public Health Committee:— "Report on Artizans' Dwellings, Boyfield Street, (Late Gun Street). These dwellings are contained in two blocks of four storeys with a frontage of 150 feet, situate on the N.E. side of Boyfield Street, at the King James Street end. There are 32 two.room and 22 single.room tenements, each tenement being approached from a corridor. They are occupied at present by 39 families comprising 164 persons. The rooms of the tenements have a cubic capacity of from 1,100 to 1,550 cubic feet, and are from 8 feet 8 inches to 9 feet 9 inches in height. They are well.lighted and ventilated, being approached from through corridors running transversely to the facade of the buildings. In each block the staircase is in the middle of the building and is dark and badly constructed; the treads of the stairs are very much worn and are dangerous to persons going up and down. There are eight water.closets of a fairly good pattern on the back wall of each block, with a similar number of water.tap3 provided with a good supply of water direct from the main, and sinks. The soil and sink.pipes are of modern size and construction, terminating above the house roof. They are outside the building. There are two inspection chambers to each block. There are also dust.shoots emptying into dust.bins at the rear of the premises. The worst structural defect in connection with these dwellings is the dark and ill.arranged staircases. The persons occupying the dwellings are of the lowest class, dirty and untidy. The rooms and water.closets, when put into proper repair, are by the habits of such persons quickly rendered dirty and out of order. Many of the water.closets are now out of repair. During the past year 69 notices have been served by the sanitary inspector to remedy the foul 143 condition of the rooms and the blocked condition of the water.closets. The premises have been constantly visited by Mr. Jenkinson, the ward inspector. He has had considerable difficulty in getting his notices complied with, principally due to the incapacity of the owner of the premises to manage her property. The owner's estate is in bankruptcy, which makes it difficult for the Council to proceed against the Receiver in the Police Court with any degree of satisfaction. I have written to the lady, who is the Receiver, advising her to appoint some lady accustomed to the administering of such property, but up to now she has been content to look after it herself, with the assistance of an occasional caretaker who is supposed to do the repairs. I would advise the Committee to continue serving notices, and in the event of them being disregarded to proceeed before the Magistrate, as we have done on so many occasions during this year. If that has not the desired effect within a further short time, the Magistrate could be asked to grant a closing order against the premises. The persons occupying these premises are a great nuisance to the neighbourhood." Closing of houses in Steedman Court. (Nos. 14, 14a, 16, 16a, 18, 20, and 20a, Steedman Street.) The houses in this Court have been for years in a very unsatisfactory state, but during the last year they have become unfit for human habitation. The following report was made to the Public Health Committee. Proceedings were subsequently taken before the Magistrate, and a closing order was made with the consent of the owner. "Report on the Condition of Steedman Court. I have to report on the condition of the houses in the Court leading from Steedman Street by the side of the railway. The houses of the Court are numbered 14, 14a, 16, 16a, 18, 20 and 20a, Steedman Street. The approach to the court is 12 feet wide at the entrance, which is restricted to 6 feet at the further end. The length of the approach is 27 feet. The court itself is 21 by 13 feet. The houses which are of brick and three storeys were originally four in number, but some thirty years ago the owner divided up the interiors and introduced more staircases making the tenements seven. There is, 144 further, a workshop at the right hand side of the court over six combined water.closets, and a wash.house at the rear on the ground floor. The staircases and partitions are in a very defective and unsafe condition. The only case of overcrowding found was on the first floor of No. 16, which has a capacity of 1,000 cubic feet, and is occupied by two adults and three children. Two.thirds of the rooms are sufficiently lighted and ventilated, whilst one.third of them are dark and ill.ventilated. There is no provision in any of the tenements in regard to a water supply and a sink. There is a water supply in the wash.house, which is only a wash.house in name, there being no proper accommodation for the washing of clothes. There is also a further water supply from a tap and stand pipe at the entrance to the approach. The water.closets are combined and six in number on the right side of the court, they are approached through the wash.house and are so dark as to need artificial light. On my visit they were in a foul and ill. smelling condition. The interiors of the rooms themselves were in a condition needing cleansing. The various rooms are approached by defective, narrow staircases and are ill.arranged. I am, therefore, of opinion that these houses are unfit for human habitation on the following grounds: — (1) The approach to the court is too constricted for the necessary air to enter. (2) The interiors of the houses are dilapidated and ill.arranged. (3) There is not a proper and sufficient water supply and sink for each tenement. (4) The water.closets are dark and ill.ventilated. (5) The whole of the court is so debased in structure and arrangement as to be demoralising to the people occupying the houses. I advise that notices be served with the object of closing the various houses of the court." 145 Tabard Street Area. This district, which I referred to in my last Annual Report, has since then been carefully inspected. It is triangular in shape and upwards of 16 acres in extent. It has always had an evil reputation. Its morality at the present time is about the same as in the "good old days," when highwaymen and debtors had their rendezvous in the neighbourhood of St. George the Martyr's Church. There was then a gaiety and carelessness about the residents which do not obtain at the present time. There are many old people who have lived all their lives, and their fathers before them, in Tabard Street, and who fondly recall the glories of the old time when money circulated freely and when there was a certain amount of fashion in the inhabitants. Everything is now debased and it is a sad neighbour to the opulent City. Out of mere self.respect the Metropolis cannot allow such a degraded and unhealthy spot to remain. The following is a copy of the representation made to the London County Council:— BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. To the Chairman of the Special Committee re Tabard Street Area. Sir, I beg to submit herewith a copy of a representation I am making to the Clerk of the London County Council under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part I. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, G. B. Millson, Medical Officer of Health. [Copy.] BOROUGH OP SOUTHWARK. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. G. L. Gomme, Esq., Clerk of the London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W. Sir, TABARD STREET AREA. I beg to represent under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part I., that tho houses, courts and alleys lying to the 146 North of Great Dover Street, together with the streets running at right angles to that street up to the Bermondsey Borough boundary, are— (a) In such a structurally debased and worn.out condition as to be unfit for human habitation. (b) That the narrowness, closeness and bad arrangement of the streets and houses and the want of air, ventilation and light are dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants occupying the area. (c) That there is a high mortality from all diseases among the residents of the area, and (d) That there is also a high mortality from Phthisis and pulmonary diseases. The area is bounded on the North by the Bermondsey Borough boundary, Long Lane and the streets in Bermondsey immediately to the south of that street; on the South by Great Dover Street; on the West by Nebraska Street, Sterry Street and Southall Place, and on the East by Weston Street and Little Hunter Street. The extent of the area is 16 acres 1 rood 18 poles 28 yards, and it includes the following streets:—Tabard Street (with the exception of Nos. 1 to 49, 2 to 44 and Messrs. Dewrance's Works), Fox's Buildings, Henry Place, Southall Place (Nos. 11 to 21, 29 and 20 to 30). St. Stephen's Square (excluding the Church and Vicarage), St. Stephen's Place, Wickham Place, Wickham Court, Staple Street (Nos. 23 to 45 and 30 to 68), Stannage, Upper Mill, Dobbs Cross, Walker Street (Nos. 1 to 16), Delph Street, Camelot Street, Amicable How, Etham Street, Pardoner Street, Westcott Street (excluding London County Council Schools), Lansdowne Place, Falstaff Yard, Little Hunter Street (Nos. 9 to 16), Paull's Yard, Nebraska Street (Nos. 2, 3 and 4). Globe Street (Nos. 3, 5, 7 and 2, 4, 6) Law Street, Violet Place (Nos. 2, 3, 4), Warren Place (Nos. 1 to 8), George Court, Black Horse Court, Little Britain, Fox's Court and Board's Buildings. By a census taken in November, 1909, the population was found to be 4,762 persons, making 293 to the acre. Of the 4,762 persons 57 were inmates of common lodging.houses, 1,279 persons occupied one.room tenements, of which 407 were living more than two in a room; 1,096 persons occupied two.room tenements, of which 464 were more than two in a room; 905 persons 147 occupied three.room tenements, of which 218 were more than two in a room; 1,425 persons occupied tenements of 4 rooms and upwards, of which 182 were more than two in a room. Therefore 27 per cent. of the population of the area was overcrowded. The area comprises 775 dwelling houses of which 40 were unoccupied at the time of the inspection, 20 stables, 15 warehouses, 7 factories, 10 workshops, 4 mission.halls, and 2 common lodging. house, making a total of 833 premises. Of the 775 houses, 163 are of three storeys, and 612 of two storeys. Most of the three storey houses have also a cellar which in eight cases is being used as a workshop. In six houses the back wall is of wood, and in ten houses there is no back yard. The houses as a whole are structually defective and ill arranged. The rooms in the three storey houses are of an average floor space of about 80 square feet, whilst those of the two storey houses average 65 square feet. The site at the East end of the area is 12.6 feet and at the West end 16 feet above Datum. Each house, with the exceptions above.mentioned, has a small back yard.

MILLSON, Public Health Office, Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Southwark. 22nd November, 1909. 160 Resignation of Mr. Long, Chief Sanitary Inspector, and the appointment of a successor. By the retirement of Mr. Long the Council has lost an excellent and capable officer, and tbe Public Health Staff a sincere friend who was an example of what a colleague ought to be. Mr. Long's service of nearly forty years under the Newington Vestry, and later under the Southwark Borough Council, is very exceptional in regard to length. He was, I believe, the oldest in service of all London Sanitary Inspectors. Many of us served our apprenticeship to Public Health under him. Although in the ordinary way he might be said to be advanced in years, yet at his retirement we all thought him a young man. He was the father of the Public Health Staff, and we all owe much to his sound and kind advice. The position of Mr. Long on the staff was unique, and it could hardly be expected that another would exactly occupy his position. On the appointment of a successor I made the following report to the Public Health Committee:— To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Covimittee. 30th March, 1909. Gentlemen, I have to report in respect of the vacancy arising from the retirement on account of age of Mr. Long, the late Chief Sanitary Inspector. I believe it is the pretty general opinion among the members of the Council that the office and name of Chief Sanitary Inspector should not be continued. I may say that the office of Chief Sanitary Inspector, from force of circumstances, has become entirely unnecessary. At a period when the Medical Officer of Health gave but a small portion of his time to the work it was imperative that there should be such an officer as the Chief Sanitary Inspector who would be constantly in command, but now with a whole.time Medical Officer of Health matters have completely changed, and the appointment has become in a very large measure obsolete. The Council at the inception of the Borough in arranging the various departments, excepting that of Public Health, and in setting 161 out the duties of the chief officials was clearly impressed with the necessity of making the chief official entirely responsible to the Council for the well.being of his department. The appointment of a Chief Sanitary Inspector directing on his own authority the sanitary work, with attendance on the Committee, made a dual control, and of course a dual responsibility, which I do not think is contemplated in the duties either of the Medical Officer of Health or of the Sanitary Inspectors, as defined by the Sanitary Officers (London) Order of 1891, and in no other department, except that of Public Health, has this dual control been made. The impossibility of this dual control was seen by Mr. Long, the late Chief Sanitary Inspector, who continued from the creation of the Borough until his retirement, to act with me as an assistant rather than as a Chief Sanitary Inspector. The appointment of another Chief Sanitary Inspector, imbued with the desire to render his office independent of the Medical Officer of Health, would seriously curtail the efficiency of the department, and might make matters unworkable. I know of no borough in London which has made such an appointment within the last few years. It is desirable, however, that there should be assistance given to the Medical Officer of Health in the supervision of the other inspectors, and in the systematic inspection of the district, which is a part of the Medical Officer of Health's duty. This assistance to the Medical Officer of Health might be given by the appointment of an officer to take the place of the late Chief Sanitary Inspector, and this I should prefer owing to the inadvisability at the present time of any curtailment of the inspector staff. Knowing, however, the desire for economy on the part of the Council this assistance might possibly be given by a Sanitary Inspector appointed to a Ward in which the duties were the lightest; although I am not certain that any one Sanitary Inspector could perform the Ward Inspector's duties together with those of assistant to the Medical Officer of Health. Such a scheme, however, in my opinion is worthy of a trial for a period of six months, when it would be seen if this new arrangement were working satisfactorily. My opinion is, therefore:— (1) That the name and office of Chief Sanitary Inspector should be formally abolished. 162 (2) That Mr. Weatheritt, now acting as Food and Drugs Inspector, should be appointed as Sanitary Inspector for St. Jude's Ward, to discharge therein all the duties of the office as defined by the Sanitary Officers (London) Order of 1891, the population of the Ward being estimated at 15,308, and further to assist the Medical Officer of Health in supervising and co.ordinating the work of the other inspectors, together with making from time to time a systematic inspection of the houses of the Borough. (3) That the Sanitary Inspector so assisting the Medical Officer of Health should not attend the Committee. (Signed) G. B. Millson, Medical Officer of Health,. On 5th May, 1909, the Council adopted the following report:— Your Committee have given the matter earnest consideration, and have decided to adopt the suggestions of the Medical Officer of Health until the 25th December, 1909, as an experiment, and in order to afford the Committee an opportunity of judging how the proposed arrangement will work. As a temporary arrangement, therefore, they Becommend:— (a) That the name and office of Chief Sanitary Inspector be abolished. (b) That until the 25th December, 1909, Mr. Weatheritt, now acting as Food and Drugs Inspector, be appointed as Sanitary Inspector for St. Jude's Ward, to discharge therein all the duties of the office as defined by the Sanitary Inspectors (London) Order of 1891, and further to assist the Medical Officer of Health in supervising and co.ordinating the work of other inspectors, together with making from time to time a systematic inspection of the houses in the Borough. On the 16th March, 1910, the matter came again before the Council on the Public Health Committee's Report:— 163 The Committee have to report that on the 26th April, 1909, consequent upon the resignation of Mr. A. Long as Chief Sanitary Inspector, the Committee considered as to the requisite adjustment of the staff of the Public Health Department, and eventually submitted the following recommendations, which were adopted by the Council on the 5th May, 1909, viz.:— (a) That the name and office of Chief Sanitary Inspector be abolished. (b) That until the 25th December, 1909, Mr. Weatheritt, now acting as Food and Drugs Inspector, be appointed as Sanitary Inspector for St. Jude's Ward, to discharge therein all the duties of the office as defined by the Sanitary Inspectors (London) Order of 1891, and further to assist the Medical Officer of Health in supervising and co-ordinating the work of other inspectors, together with making from time to time a systematic inspection of the houses in the Borough. Recommend:— That Mr. James Weatheritt be appointed "Senior Inspector"; that he be appointed Sanitary Inspector for St. Jude's Ward, to discharge therein all the duties of the office as defined by the Sanitary Inspectors (London) Order of 1891, and further to assist the Medical Officer of Health in supervising and co.ordinating the work of other inspectors, together with making from time to time a systematic inspection of the houses in the borough. [Referred back. On 20th April, 1910, the Council again considered the matter: — Readjustment of Staff, Public Health Department. Your Committee have to report that they have again gone into the whole question of the readjustment of the staff of the Public Health Department consequent upon the resignation of Mr. A. Long as Chief Sanitary Inspector, and after careful and prolonged consideration the Committee submit the following recommendation as being 164 in their opinion the most suitable for the good working of the Department. They Recommend:— (a) That Mr. James Weatheritt (a Sanitary Inspector) be appointed "Assistant to the Medical Officer of Health," and that his duties be to assist in supervising and coordinating the work of other inspectors, and generally to act under the directions of the Medical Officer of Health; and that application be made to the Local Government Board for their sanction to the appointment. [Adopted. (b) That Mr. James Weatheritt be required to attend the meetings of the Public Health and Sanitary Committee. [Adopted. 165 The following work of supervision has been carried out during the year by Mr. Weatheritt and Mr. David:— MILKSELLERS. During 1909, 134 persons were registered as Milksellers in the Borough. 113 persons were removed from the register during the same period, having ceased to sell milk, the number of milksellers actually on the Register at the end of the year was 421. On 13 premises the sale of milk was discontinued, and it was newly started on 11 premises. 690 inspections of the various milkshops were made during the year. A number of nuisances were found to exist, in respect of which 35 written notices were served. The defects found on inspection were as follow:— Dirty milkshops 25 cases Dirty milkstores 8 „ Paving defective 3 „ Animals in Milkstore 2 „ Dirty Milk 2 „ Total 40 cases These insanitary conditions were all remedied.
