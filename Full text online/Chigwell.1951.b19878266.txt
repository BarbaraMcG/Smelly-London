To the Chairman and Members of the Chigwell Urban District Council. MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES. AND GENTLEMEN. I have pleasure in presenting to you the Annual Report including the report of the Senior Sanitary Inspector, for the year ending 31st December. 1951. vital statistics. The birth-rate and death-rate were little different from the previous year. Live births exceeded deaths by 502. The population increased by 4,480 due mainly to immigration into the L.C.C. Housing Estates. infectious diseases (See also Section f). Measles, whooping cough and dysentery were markedly prevalent during the Spring, though most cases were mild. Admissions to hospital were less than 1 per cent of cases, with only one death (measles). Thorough investigation failed to reveal any spread of dysentery by public food supplies, and direct case-to-case infection seems to have been the rule. As cases in the same family were frequently recorded, a disappointingly low standard of personal hygiene in many homes can be deduced. One case of enteric fever occurred (Paratyphoid A) in a child recently returned from a caravan holiday in another area. The usual precautions were instituted and all local practitioners were immediately warned. No further cases were reported in the District. food poisoning. Incidents in which definite food poisoning bacteria were involved were limited to 4, with a total of 7 cases. Sliced, wrapped bread was responsible for 2 cases, and sausages were suspected in another one. The foodstuff responsible for the remaining 4 cases could not be identified. There were no deaths. poliomyelitis. (Infantile Paralysis) was less prevalent than in recent years, only 4 cases being notified (no deaths). diphtheria was again entirely absent from the District, for the fifth successive year. 1 The last deaths (2) from this disease in the District occurred in 1939, when there were 23 cases, the population of the District then being 25,500. It is satisfactory to note that the response to the Diphtheria Immunisation Scheme is being well maintained (see page 34). tuberculosis. The number of established cases of tuberculosis entering the District under re-housing schemes (75) was considerably less than in 1950 (157). The notification rate of fresh cases on the new estates was slightly more than in the remainder of the District, but it must be borne in mind that in a number of these the infection must have taken place under the old. unsatisfactory conditions prior to arrival in this District. mass radiography. Arrangements were made for the mobile Mass Radiography Unit of the N.E. Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board to visit the District in January, 1951. Free X-Ray of chest was available to all members of the public over the age of 14 years. Attendances were as follows:— School Children School Staff Others Total Manor Hall, Chigwell. 476 14 431 921 St. John's Hall, Loughton 331 5 634 970 St. John's Hall, Buckhurst Hill 292 — 438* 730 1,099 19 1,503 2,621 *Including 23 members of the Council Staff. 2 Number recalled for further investigation: 76. The following findings were later confirmed:— Cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Discovered:— Active Primary Nil Active Post-primary 1 Inactive Primary 35 Inactive Post-primary 25 Other Interesting Abnormalities Discovered:— Pneumonitis 3 Bronchiectasis 5 Pleural effusion 1 Cardiovascular lesions— Congenital 2 Acquired 7 Dextrocardia 1 Transposed Viscera 1 Arrangements for further sessions held on the Hainault Estate early in 1952 were also completed. During the year a voluntary scheme for the vaccination of susceptible children of school leaving age against tuberculosis (with B.C.G. vaccine) was introduced by arrangement between the Essex County Council and the Medical Research Council. The response was good, and a large number of children have now been immunised, though details of results are not yet available. housing. It will be seen (Section D) that considerable progress has been made in re-housing both by the Chigwell Urban District Council and the London County Council. The special housing needs of old people are of particular interest at present. The provision of cheap and convenient houses or hostels, combined with the minimum of supervision and domiciliary service, enables the old folk to carry on much longer without the need for expensive (and unpopular) institutional care. It is therefore satisfactory to note that 210 Old People's Dwellings (including L.C.C.) have been erected in the District since the war, and further homes and hostels for old people are contemplated in our own future schemes. 3 national assistance act, 1948 (section 47). Ten persons "in need of care and attention" were referred for possible action under this section. Four of these were kept under observation, and the remaining six were admitted to institutions as voluntary cases by arrangement with local hospitals or with the Welfare Department of the Essex County Council, as appropriate. It was thus possible to avoid compulsory removal under the above Act in all cases. clean food campaign. The Hygienic Food Traders' Guild operating in conjunction with the Waltham Holy Cross Urban District Council made slow progress during the year, membership having increased from 47 to 54. The Spring outbreak of dysentery was fully used to emphasise to householders and traders alike, by means of public statements and interviews with the press, the importance of clean food handling. The campaign culminated in a 4-day public exhibition at the Lopping Hall, Loughton, during October, 1951, held in conjunction with the Infestation Control Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Ministry of Food, and the following exhibitors:— J. Lyons & Co., Ltd. Deosan Ltd. London Electricity Board. North Thames Gas Board. Essex County Council (Central Council for Health Education). Essex County Council (Milk). United Dairies Ltd. (Milk). Hoover Ltd. Jeye's Sanitary Compounds Co., Ltd. Mr. S. T. Perry. J. & E. Hall Ltd.,—Wet Fish Display Counter. Clenaglass Washer Company Ltd. Crypto Ltd.—Food Slicing Machine. Whaley Bridge Manufacturing Co., Ltd. —Nylon Overalls. 4 The Exhibition, which included demonstrations of the work of the Public Health Department and of the Guild, and a continuous film show, was officially opened by Dr. H. Kenneth Cowan, County Medical Officer, and was visited by approximately 1000 people, including canteen workers and organised parties of (250) secondary school children. Prizes of £2. 2. 0d., and £1. 1. 0d.. were awarded for the best two essays submitted by schoolchildren. The Exhibition cost approximately £100 (including publicity) of which £24 was reimbursed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Despite the campaign, I am still far from satisfied with the general standard of hygiene in food shops and cafes. All employers must surely know by now that the regular manipulation of "ready-to-eat" food with the naked hands is abhorrent to the discerning consumer, and dangerous to all; yet it is still rare to see tongs, scoops and paper in regular use. It is intended to offer facilities through the Guild for holding lectures for food handling personnel during 1952, and it is hoped that the direct approach may lead to an improvement in technique. In the statistical tables which follow, births and deaths have been, corrected for "inward" and "outward" transfers, i.e., they refer only to persons who normally reside in the district, and they include all births and deaths among them wherever occurring. Infectious diseases, however, are allocated to the District in which they arise, irrespective of the place of normal residence of the patient. All rates and figures include members of the armed forces stationed in the area. In conclusion, I would again like to record my appreciation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and to the staff of the Public Health Department for their help and co-operation during the year. For the statistical information which the Area Health and Divisional Educational Departments of the County Council have provided for this report, grateful acknowledgements are also made. H.

These premises have been inspected and are being conducted in a satisfactory manner. 13 SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA 1. (i) Water. The water supply for the whole district is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board except for one house deep in Epping Forest, the supply of which is obtained from a well. The supply has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity. All houses have a piped supply except the house referred to above. The number of houses is 14,485 and the population at mid-year approximately 53.000 Samples of water were taken as shown below:— From wells 1 Satisfactory. From swimming baths 3 Satisfactory. (ii) Drainage and Sewerage. The reconstruction of the main works at Luxborough has proceeded during the year but will require at least another twelve months to complete, and may even be further delayed by the lengthy periods for delivery of essential materials and plant. In the circumstances the works have functioned fairly well in spite of overload conditions and sludge treatment difficulties and a reasonable effluent has been produced. Millers Lane Works have worked well since the reconstruction and the effluent has been consistently satisfactory. The five pumping plants have given satisfactory service throughout the year. 2. Rivers and Streams. The River Roding passes through the centre of the Urban District dividing the wards of Chigwell on the south-east and Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side. There arte no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area which is under the jurisdiction of the Roding Catchment Board. Although the rainfall has been heavier than usual during the year there has been no serious flooding except in the recreation grounds which lie within the flood plain of the River Roding. 14 3. (i) Closet Accommodation and Cesspools. Number of Cesspools and Septic Tanks: Buckhurst Hill 1 Chigwell 76 Loughton 12 89 Number of Earth or Chemical Closets in Houses: Chigwell 39 Loughton 6 45 Number of Chemical Closets in Caravans: Buckhurst Hill 2 Chigwell 21 Loughton 1 24 Premises served by earth or chemical closets and cesspools are in areas where no sewer is available. One house containing four flats has been connected to main drainage during the year. It is hoped in the near future to connect two more houses which are at present draining into cesspools. As opportunity offers, every endeavour is made to connect properties to main drainage. (ii) Public Cleansing. Collection of house refuse once weekly throughout the district has continued during the year, by the Council's own covered vehicles and manual staff. The service now utilises five 10/12 cubic yard "Fordson" lorries with "Eagle" tipping bodies together with a similar vehicle of 7 cubic yard capacity working part-time to deal with schools and special collections. Trade refuse has been collected on a scale of charges and there is a very general use of this service by local traders. Disposal of refuse has been by controlled tipping at a tip rented from a local contractor. The standard of this operation has been improved by the use of a bulldozer for levelling the refuse and applying covering material. Measures as necessary have been taken against fly and vermin infestation. 15 Salvage recovery, principally of paper and rags has continued at the tip by Council employees. The total useful salvage recovered and disposed of during the year was 353 tons, including 341 tons of paper. Kitchen waste has continued to be collected from street bins and 305 tons have been conveyed to concentrator plant, now at Tottenham in substitution for the previous disposal at Stapleford Abbotts. Road gullies (in streets maintained by the inhabitants at large) are emptied three times in each year and re-sealed with clean water. This is done by mechanical suction process under contract. (iii) Sanitary Inspection of the Area. An outline of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors is shown below:— Complaints received and dealt with 790 Inspections made 8407 Nuisances abated 338 Informal Notices served 119 Informal Notices complied with 115 Statutory Notices served 38 Statutory Notices complied with 37 Legal Proceedings 2 Summary of Nuisances. Drains blocked or defective 195 Defective water closets 15 Defective water supply pipes 6 Nuisances from Animals 2 Polluted ditches and watercourses 5 Accumulation of refuse etc., 14 Vermin, bugs and fleas 19 Cellars flooded 3 Fly infestations 8 Cesspools overflowing or defective 5 Wasps and hornets 66 16 (iv) Verminous Houses 19 houses were found to be verminous during the year. These houses were fumigated with "Fumite" and sprayed with "Zaldecide" or "Cooper's Bed Bug Spray" with very good results. Number of inspection and visits: 34. RODENT CONTROL. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949. 1924 visits were made during 1951. Treatment was by:— Poisons. Red Squill 10 per cent with sausage rusk. Zinc Phosphide 2½ per cent „ „ Arsenious Oxide 10 per cent „ „ Antu 2 per cent „ „ and occasionally by means of trapping or use of Cyanide Gas. A new poison called Warfarin has been introduced and will be used when practicable. There is no serious infestation but the rodent population seems to remain constant despite every effort to deplete the numbers. One reason for this is, of course, the large areas of open spaces such as farm and forest lands. Baiting and poisoning of the Council's sewers was carried out three times during the year with the results as shown below:— (a) (b) (c) Manholes baited 111 65 202 Prebait (part takes) 2 10 3 Prebait (complete takes) 13 22 10 Poison (part takes) 10 32 — Poison (complete takes) 4 — — (a) Poison Zinc Phosphide. (b) Poison Arsenious Oxide. (c) Test Baiting. 17 SECTION D.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. (a) Milk Supply. From 1st October, 1951, the Minister of Food, declared this Urban District, together with the rest of Greater London covered by the Metropolitan Police Area to be a specified area under powers conferred upon him by section 23 of the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950. This, in effect, means that only designated milks are allowed to be sold, i.e., Tuberculin Tested milk. Pasteurised milk. Sterilized milk. Accredited milk (from one farm only). 34 samples of milk were taken by the Weights and Measures Department of the County Council during the year and all were reported upon as being genuine.

No cases of diphtheria occurred during the year. The free immunisation of children by general practitioners and at clinics has been maintained. 1,172 children completed a course of immunisation during the year. 586 re-inforcing injections were also administered. Tuberculosis. 51 new cases of lung tuberculosis, and 8 of tuberculosis of other organs were notified during the year. 36 of these new cases occurred amongst residents of the L.C.C. Estates. In addition to these new cases 75 established cases of tuberculosis, originally acquired in other areas, took up residence in this district during the year; 73 of these are new residents on the L.C.C. Estates. There were 9 deaths from tuberculosis during the year compared with 14 in 1950 and 16 in 1949. Vaccination Schemes. Tuberculosis (B.C.G.) See page 3). Smallpox. 512 primary vaccinations were performed, and 151 persons were re-vaccinated during the year. Since the number of primary vaccinations is approximately only 62 per cent of the total number of live births for the year, this situation cannot be regarced as satisfactory. The increasing use of long-distance air travel constantly adds to the risk of importation of this disease during the incubation period, and the consequent infection of numerous contacts before the disease can be recognised. Apart from the greater risk of complications when the first vaccination is delayed until an outbreak of smallpox occurs, there is therefore also the added danger that it may then be too late to be effective. For these reasons, every child should receive its primary vaccination in infancy, and parents who omit to obtain this protection (which is provided free to all under the National Health Service) for their children, may be taking upon themselves a grave responsibility. Ambulance personnel of the local ambulance station and members of the Public Health Department staff were vaccinated, as necessary, during the year. 34 APPENDIX.
