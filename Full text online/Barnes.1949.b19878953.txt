Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1949. As 1949 was the first complete year of the National Health Service it was thus the first year in which the Maternity and Child Welfare Services did not come under the Borough Council. However, for the greater part of the year many of the members of the staff, transferred to Surrey County Council in July, 1948, still remained in this department pending reorganisation of these services. During the year under review the health of the Borough has been good, but Housing remains a terrifying problem and our list of cases requiring housing on medical grounds still grows. It is obvious that bad housing is a serious danger to health, mental as well as physical, and people living under such conditions derive little benefit from the medical services. I should like to express my thanks to the Council for their continued help and keen interest in matters relating to public health. Also I must pay tribute to all the members of the staff for their good work and loyal co-operation. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ROSETTA HILL, September, 1949. Medical Officer of Health. 5 BOROUGH OF BARNES. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1949 PREFACE In accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 2/50, the Annual Report for 1949 has been prepared on the same lines as previous years, and consists of two parts—a preface in which reference is made to items of special interest, and an appendix in which is tabulated the statistics relating to the health of the district. STAFF With the exception of the appointment of Mr. J. M. Read to fill a clerical vacancy, there was no alteration in the staff of the department during 1949. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES Generally During 1949 there was the usual two-yearly epidemic of Measles ; also a number of cases of Poliomyelitis. Apart from this, the incidence of infectious disease was low, and there were no deaths of an infectious origin. No cases of diphtheria were notified during the year. Poliomyelitis In the epidemic of Poliomyelitis during the year Barnes had ten cases. Of these, six recovered completely with no residual paralysis. Paralysis resulted in the other four cases ; three only slightly and one more extensive. Tuberculosis The number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis again shows a reduction, this time by a fifth of the previous year's figures. The number of deaths from tuberculosis was twenty-one compared with nineteen the previous year. The figures for non-pulmonary tuberculosis cases were also very similar in number as for 1948. MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE There were no maternal deaths during the year. 6 INFANT MORTALITY RATE The number of deaths of infants under one year of age during 1949 was seven, the death rate per 1,000 live births being 13.5 This is a substantial decrease over the previous year when the death rate was 20.8, up to then the lowest ever recorded in the area. The rates for England and Wales were:— 1948 34 1949 32 As a matter of interest, the average for Barnes for the six years prior to the war (1934-1939) was 53 per 1,000 live births; for the six war years (1940-1945) 45; and for the three post war years (1946-1948) 31. This year's Infant Mortality Rate therefore not only shows a marked reduction on previous years but is the lowest ever recorded in this borough. REMOVAL OF PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE AND ATTENTION Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, makes special provision for securing the necessary care and attention for persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated are living in insanitary conditions, and are unable to devote to themselves, or are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. In only one case during the year was it found necessary to apply to the magistrates, but before the order was granted the patient agreed to go voluntarily to hospital. Seven cases were reported of elderly persons who were not receiving proper care and attention, and through co-operation with the County Council Welfare Department and the Regional Hospital Board arrangements were made for admission to hospital or other residential accommodation. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT The investigation of complaints lodged by members of the public, and the resultant action, takes up a large proportion of the time of the Sanitary Inspectors. The majority of these complaints are concerned with the lack of repair of dwelling houses. There is now no great difficulty in obtaining sufficient labour and materials to carry out essential repairs, but the main cause of the reluctance of landlords to carry out works is the high cost of repairs. The maintenance of old properties, which are usually let at comparatively low rents, is likely to prove a burden which owners will find impossible to carry unless other funds are forthcoming. The economic conditions of the past 7 ten years discouraged owners from incurring expenditure on repairs. In some cases the cost of proper reconditioning is now more than the houses are worth for investment purposes. There is obvious need for a complete revision of the financial arrangements relating to rents and repairs in respect of dwellings of low rateable value. EXHUMATIONS Three exhumations were carried out within the borough during the year, and all were attended by a Sanitary Inspector. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were conducted with due solemnity, every consideration being paid to matters of hygiene and decency. FOOD The supervision of premises where food is handled and distributed has continued to receive a considerable amount of attention. It can be stated that there has been a steady improvement in the standard of cleanliness and the conduct of these establishments. There are still a considerable number of employees in the food trade who are not sufficiently aware of the potential danger of illness and possible death which may follow the consumption of food which has been contaminated. Closer control of conditions in food premises will be possible when the proposed byelaws of the Ministry of Food are brought into operation. It is satisfactory to state, however, that only one case of suspected food poisoning, involving only one person, was reported during the year. Investigations made failed to reveal the source of infection. Statistics show that the greatest risk of contamination exists in the larger canteens and kitchens of industrial concerns and institutions. The main danger of contamination occurs where food is handled, mixed and heated and allowed to cool slowly, and then not consumed for many hours. If food cannot be consumed immediately after preparation it should be rapidly cooled, and stored in a cool position. Ice Cream Ice cream is manufactured at two premises in the area. Conditions have been found to be generally satisfactory, and regular samples are taken for bacteriological examination and chemical analysis. In addition, frequent sampling is carried out of ice cream from distribution points in shops, etc. FACTORIES The table No. 21 in the statistical section gives details of visits made to factories in the area. It is perhaps not generally realised that 8 in factories where mechanical power is used (that is, of course, the majority of factories), these visits relate only to the condition of the sanitary conveniences, the supervision of the health and welfare arrangements for employees coming under the control of H.M. Factory Inspector. It is a matter for regret that the powers of the local authority should not be more extensive in this direction, or alternatively that the whole of the provisions of the Factories Act should be enforced by H.M. Inspectors. RODENT CONTROL There have been no major infestations by rats in the district, the 300 odd complaints being mainly in respect of rats seen in back gardens, especially near chicken sheds. It is not generally realised that there is an obligation on occupiers of property not only to notify the local authority of the presence of rats, but also to take every practical step themselves to get rid of the rats, and to discourage their return. This applies especially to poultry keepers, and to those premises where food is stored. The council have continued to operate a Pest Destruction Service, this being free of charge to householders, except where negligence is proved. The main sewers have been treated twice during the year by baiting and poisoning against rats. WATER SUPPLY The water supply of the area has been satisfactory, both in quality and quantity. The very few complaints that were received were found to be due to conditions of storage and distribution on the occupiers' premises, and appropriate action was taken to have these conditions remedied. Water is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board; a piped supply is provided to every house in the district, and control samples are taken regularly and frequently by the Board's officers.

These samples, taken from milk roundsmen and local retailers, proved to be quite satisfactory. (b) Bacteriological Examination and Phosphatase Test. Taken from Total No. taken Results Satisfactory Not satisfactory Schools 15 11 4* Other sources 2 2 — Phosphatase tests were also carried out by the Laboratory on all the above. * The four samples reported as being unsatisfactory were all from the same source. Investigations were instituted, and the trouble was found to be caused by the upset in routine due to the replacement of old machinery by new, the proportion of old plant remaining being overloaded. 21 Samples marked * were found to be below standard. Hors D'oeuvre. (Antipasto). The Public Analyst reported that this sample (an unopened tin) was incorrectly labelled. Investigations were made and after correspondence with the Ministry of Food it was discovered that this stock had been imported shortly after the introduction of the Labelling Order which had been infringed. No further importations were being made, and a formal warning was issued. Lemonade Tablets. The Public Analyst reported that these tablets were falsely described as Lemonade Tablets, the liquid produced by dissolving one tablet in a tumblerful of water being odourless and almost tasteless, bearing no resemblance to lemonade After consideration of all the facts of the case the Council decided that legal proceedings were not necessary but that a formal w arning be sent to the vendor. Essence of Rennet. This sample proved to have been taken from an odd bottle of very old stock. Proceedings were not considered necessary, and further samples taken of this brand have proved quite satisfactory. Salt Beef and Salt Beef Liquor. These samples were taken as a result of a routine visit to a Butcher's Shop, where a metal pickling bin had been installed in place of the old wooden type. The Public Analyst reported that the samples were contaminated with comparatively large quantities of zinc, extracted from the metal of the bin. The butcher, on advice, reverted to the wooden type of container. Sausage Meat and Beef Sausages. These samples proved to be of inferior quality.
