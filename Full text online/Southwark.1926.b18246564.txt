Public Health Department Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. To His Worship the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Dear Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting my Report for the year 1926, there is no outstanding feature to which I have to draw attention. The general health of the Borough has been good, and there has been a considerable fall in the death rate, and also in the deaths of children under one year of age. The death rate is the lowest in the history of the Borough, and the infantile mortality rate, with the exception of the year 1923, is also the lowest. The birth rate is steadily declining, but this fact does not affect the population to any extent, if more of those born live and grow up healthy and strong. Fewer babies and stronger ones is better than many births with a heavy infantile mortality rate, and in this respect our Welfare Centres have amply justified their existence, and the money spent on them. There has been considerable zymotic disease, but of a mild type, and the result in mortality has not been heavy. The more recently notifiable and less known diseases of Encephalitis Lethargica (Sleepy Sickness) and Cerebro.spinal Fever have each caused three deaths. There were no cases of Typhus Fever nor Small Pox during the year, though many cases of possible Small Pox were seen at the request of the medical attendant, which in every instance were found to be cases of Chicken Pox or other disease. The question of clean food has received considerable attention, both out of doors on butchers shops and stalls, and also indoors in the kitchens and store rooms of eating houses. There has been a remarkable improvement in the stalls and shop fronts. Many glass windows have been put in, and the meat protected in a way that was not done a couple 2 of years ago. There is still room for legislation as regards the exposure of fish, fruits and sweets, which are freely exposed in shops and on stalls. I have made observations in many other Boroughs, and in my opinion Southwark compares very favourably with any I have seen. Overcrowding still is our great difficulty, but every effort that can be made to alleviate it, is being put forward. The mortality from cancer is high in Southwark, as everywhere, and is greater in males than in females. Circulars are distributed by the Health Visitors urging early consultation where suspicious symptoms occur, for early operation is as yet the only recoguised cure, but in spite of the splendid hospital facilities we are fortunate in possessing it does not appear as though they were sufficiently used. Venereal Disease has a far reaching effect on the general health of the population, and is being dealt with at a special clinic at Guy's Hospital, which is open daily to both sexes free of charge and without publicity. Notices of the hours of attendance are exhibited in our conveniences and other places, and it is hoped to lessen the incidence and results of these complaints, which cause suffering and ill health both to adults and their offspring. The virulence of these diseases is dying down, and there is not nearly the amount of venereal disease that existed 20 years ago, but there is still a very great deal existing, and concentrated and combined effort is needed to keep it under control. One of the chief characteristics of the Borough of Southwark is that in addition to the usual industries of a large city, the proximity to the Thames brings into the Borough an enormous amount of foreign produce, frozen meats, tinned food of all kinds, flour, Chinese egg yolk, and other edible commodities, all of which have to be supervised and dealt with if found to be unsound. Two specially trained inspectors are constantly supervising this trade, and the tables in the report show the enormous amount of food supervised and the work entailed in that supervision. Southwark's cold stores and warehouses are some of the most important in the country. In addition to the supervision of imported foods there is also the question of the export of manufactured food products to foreign countries. Each country has its own regulations, but these products have to be examined by the Inspector, and certified by myself before they can be admitted to a foreign country, and as I am appointed Certifying Officer 3 or the U.S.A., Canada, Phillipine Islands, Turkey, and other countries, the food products sent to these countries must be accompanied by a certificate signed by myself, and during the year £94 10s. has been received by the Council for such certificates. Under the Food and Drugs and Milk and Dairies Acts excellent work has been done by Mr. Nicholson, which is fully set out in the text of the Report, as is also the work done by the Borough Analyst. The Maternity and Child Welfare staff has also done excellent work, which is summarised in the tables, and a diminished infantile mortality points to success, and gives encouragement to the workers. The improvement in the babies is remarkable, and the general cleanliness and well. being of the children compared with others I have seen, whose parents will not attend the Centres, or listen to advice, is quite noticeable. Great credit is due to our staff, and thanks to the voluntary helpers who have united to bring about this result. The work of the Tuberculosis Dispensary is fully reported, and a great deal has been accomplished. This work is exacting and done under depressing circumstances, and great praise is due to the Dispensary staff for their perseverance and enthusiasm. The preventive side of the question receives special attention, but in an overcrowded area it is an enormous task. A steady campaign has been waged against rats, and a considerable number have been caught. In addition many poison baits have been put down, which must account for an enormous number of these pests being destroyed. As a result, though certain localities are still infested, there has been a marked diminution of complaints, and it is a general opinion that rats are not so prevalent. In most cases the runs have ultimately been traced to defective drains or sewers, and thus incidentally a great deal of drainage work has been carried out which otherwise would have passed undetected. The grey sewer rat is the usual one in this district, the black rat being rarely caught. The chief defects found in tracing rats were due to old and worn out drain pipes, old barrel drains not filled in, and branches of old drains not sealed off from the sewers, which formed nesting places. These are inevitable in an old district, parts of which have been rebuilt more than once. There are in Southwark many large blocks of tenements of various grades. Some are excellent, and kept in very good condition, but others are badly planned, dark and poorly kept. One of the difficulties en. 4 countered is the untidy habit of the tenants in throwing refuse out of the windows, although adequate arrangements are made for dealing with this rubbish in a proper manner. This chiefly occurs in the poorer class of tenements, but it is by no means confined to these. Untidy and careless parents will by force of example produce untidy and careless children, and the best efforts of school teachers are of small avail to combat home influences, which fact is evident in the degeneration of the habits of the children after a prolonged vacation, and the litter and dirt scattered in the parks and public places after a general holiday. During the year 298 men were medically examined with a view to employment as permanent or temporary members of the Council's staff, and 43 employees were examined and reported on as a result of accident or illness. The Municipal Creche is very popular, and during the year 149 individual babies were admitted with a total attendance of 8,724. The health of the children has been good, and the Creche fully occupied with the exception of a few weeks when whooping cough was prevalent in the district. An arrangement has been entered into for the Sunlight Treatment of ailing babies who attend the clinic at Guy's Hospital, but it has been in operation for too short a time as yet for any substantial progress to be reported. In presenting this Report I must tender my thanks to all my staff for their loyal and unremitting support, and to the Chairmen and Members of the Committees whose kind consideration and assistance has enabled this large amount of work to be successfully carried out. Yours faithfully, HORACE WILSON, Medical Officer of Health. 5 NATURAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

NURSING. Professional home nursing is not undertaken by the Borough Council, but the Benson Home for Nurses provides nursing in the Newington district, and the sum of £400 per annum is granted towards their funds. In other districts the Ranyard Nurses cover a large area, while several parishes have their own private nurse. No special Nurses are employed for infectious diseases, nor are mid. wives subsidised or employed by the Borough Council. The General Lying.in Hospital, York Road the Obstetric Wards at Guy's, and King's College Hospitals, and the wards of Southwark Hospital, are sufficient to meet the requirements of the district without the necessity of a local Maternity Home. CHEMICAL WORK. The Analytical work and Chemical work under the Food and Drugs Act and various Milk Regulations, the Bacteriological work for Infectious Diseases and Tuberculosis, are carried out by the Borough Analyst, whose report is incorporated with the Public Health report. ACTS AND BYE LAWS. There are no local Acts, but the London County Council Bye.laws are enforced (as also are local Bye.laws concerning Underground rooms, Houses Let in Lodgings and others). No midwives are employed by, or subsidised by the Borough Council. 9 POPULATION During the year 1926 the estimated population as supplied by the Registrar.General has decreased by 100, being 188,600 as against 189,000 in the previous year. All the rates in my report are calculated on the former figure. It will be seen from the subjoined table that the greater decrease in population has taken place in the St. George's District, with a lesser decrease in Newington, whilst Christchurch and St. Saviour's Wards have remained stationary. The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1922, 1923,1924 1925 and 1926, are as follows:— Newington. St. George's. St. Saviour's and Christchurch. 1841 54,693 — — 1851 64,816 51,824 35,731 1861 82,157 55,510 36,169 1871 88,691 56,083 31,294 1881 107,831 58,652 31,628 1891 115,663 59,740 27,116 1901 121,863 60,998 23,319 1911 116,819 55,782 19,316 1921 114,987 52,114 17,303 1922 116,683 52,996 17,541 1923 117,200 52,690 17,574 1924 117,500 52,610 17,604 1925 118,300 52,980 17,720 1926 118,120 52,760 17,720 10 The Ward distribution was as follows:— TABLE 1.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1926 was 3,286, of which 1,705 were males, and 1,581 females. This represents a birth.rate of 17.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 1,976; St. George the Martyr, 871; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 439. Of the 3,286 births registered in the Borough 160 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough. 684 births occurring in various lying.in and other institutions outside the Borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar.General. When the 160 "outward" transfers are deducted 11 and the 684 "inward" transfers are added to the 3,286 births actually registered in the Borough, the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 3,810. This gives a corrected birth.rate of 20.2. Birth.rate for the last Thirty Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington. St. George's St. Saviour's and Christchurch.

These deaths in institutions comprised 368 belonging to Southwark and 491 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,142. When the 502 deaths of those persons who were non.parishioners, but who died in our Borough, have been deducted, and the 1,142 "outlying'' deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the sanitary area is found to be 2,403 of which number 1,322 were males and 1,081 females. The death.rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 12.7 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1926, as against a rate of 13.1 for 1925. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 47.5. The principal localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are as follows:— Southwark Hospital 692 Mental Hospitals 108 Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals 60 St. Thomas's Hospital 47 Lambeth Hospital 30 Belgrave Hospital 9 King's College Hospital 26 Royal Waterloo Hospital 21 In the Street and other Institutions 149 Total 1142 14 TABLE 3.

VERMINOUS PERSONS CLEANSED DURING 1925. During the year 4,4411 persons were cleansed at the station in King James Street. Of these under our agreement with the London County Council, were 3,396 children. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 1,045 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 1,066 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1925. 51 MORTUARIES.

Housing conditions show a slight improvement, and overcrowding is not quite so bad as in 1925. 133 cases have been accommodated on the London County Council Estates, and others have obtained accommodation elsewhere. It is, however, the more respectable and desirable tenants who are moving elsewhere, and the overcrowded slum dweller remains as before, which can ultimately only have a bad effect on the Borough. It is found that where amenites are provided on some new estates, these are not appreciated as they should be. Quite new flats are already dirty and ill kept, the walls are dusty, w.c. pans dirty, and although baths are used where provided, the food cupboards are used for the storage of anything else rather than what they were originally provided for. IV. Unhealthy Areas.—For several years representations have been before the London County Council concerning Areas in East Street, Park Street, Rockingham Street and Draper Street. The Areas mentioned above have not yet been dealt with. The Hatfield Street area has been considered and the scheme is being put in hand by the London County Council. 52 TABLE 31. 9.—Housing.

General.—All homes are visited by a Sanitary Inspector and an Enquiry Officer, who arranges for isolation or Hospital treatment, and investigates the possible source of infection, and deals with the schools and contacts. SMALL POX. There was no case of Small Pox during 1926, nor in the preceding five years. During the present year I visited a few suspected cases which were found to be chicken pox. SCARLET FEYER. Scarlet Fever declined, both in the number and the severity of the cases, during the year, and only three deaths were recorded. This is the lowest mortality for several years. Many cases were of so mild a type that they were only identified when the peeling of the skin was occurring. These cases had chiefly been considered to suffer from a sore throat and a transient rash had passed unnoticed until careful enquiry called it to mind. The Dick test has not been used in this district. The number of cases notified and the number of deaths during the last five years were as follows:— Notified. Deaths. 1922 802 17 1923 409 4 1924 534 10 1925 741 8 1926 519 3 DIPHTHERIA. The number of notified cases of Diphtheria steadily increases as the practice of swabbing throats becomes more universal, but the cases showing serious clinical symptoms are comparatively few and the case mortality is low. The Schick Test has not been utilised. Antitoxin is supplied free of charge, and 69 Phials of 4,000 units have been supplied to Medical Practitioners in the Borough, on applying at the Town Hall or Reception House. 86 The number of cases notified and the number of deaths during the last five years were as follows:— Notified. Deaths. 1922 749 61 1923 770 49 1924 791 49 1925 905 31 1926 945 32 ENTERIC FEVER. Ten isolated cases of this disease occurred, and in each case enquiries were made as to food taken and possible cause of infection, but no common factor was found nor any definite cause in any case. The number of cases notified and the number of deaths during the last five years were as follows:— Notified. Deaths. 1922 3 3 1923 18 2 1924 12 1 1925 6 - 1926 10 3 MEASLES. There was an increase in deaths from this disease over the preceding year from complications of measles which was very prevalent. The mortality would probably have been much heavier but for the fact that measles is a notifiable disease in the Borough, and each case is visited by a health visitor who advises as to treatment when necessary, and that many serious cases were transferred to hospitals. Deaths from Measles during the last 5 years. 1922 145 1925 28 1923 13 1926 51 1924 77 DIARRHOEA. There was a slight epidemic of diarrhoea, chiefly in young babies which resulted in 50 deaths. The cases were widespread, and no general cause was found to account for them. I investigated the feeding in the case of the infants under one year of age, and found it affected breast fed infants equally with those on cows' milk or artificial milks, and that the diet could not be held responsible. 87 Deaths from Diarrhoea during the last 5 years. 1922 29 1925 58 1923 61 1926 61 1924 49 50 of these deaths occurred in infants under 2 years of age. WHOOPING COUGH. The mortality from this disease declined remarkably. The number of fatal cases during the last 5 years were as follows:— 1922 62 1925 51 1923 27 1926 5 1924 17 INFLUENZA. Influenza, although occurring was of mild type and bad cases were chiefly in old people. The number of deaths being less than half the average for the preceding five years. Deaths during the last 5 years. 1922 92 1925 25 1923 25 1926 24 1924 62 OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. 21 cases of this disease occurred, as against 14 in 1925. These cases were all visited by the lady Assistant Medical Officer and Health Visitors. Although there has been a slight increase in the cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum it is satisfactory to note that in all cases of which we have obtained particulars (19) the vision is unimpaired, a tribute to the early attention and prompt treatment of the cases due to notification. An analysis of the cases will be found hereunder. Notified. Cases treated. Vision unimpaired. Vision impaired. Total Blindness. Deaths. At home.

ACUTE PRIMARY AND INFLUENZAL PNEUMONIA. 263 cases were notified during the year. 225 of these were removed to hospital or infirmary. There were 49 deaths of these notified cases. ANTHRAX. One case occurred during the year in the person of David O'Callaghan. a loader and packer at Willow Wharf p;oods depot, Bermondsey. He was removed to Guy's Hospital on April 7th and died on the 19th. An inquest was held and the cause of death certified as follows :— " Cardiac failure due to Broncho Pneumonia and Anthrax accelerated by nitrous oxide and oxygen as an anaesthetic for an operation for abscess in abdomen due to Anthrax (misadventure)." PUERPERAL FEYER. 19 cases were notified during the year, with 6 deaths. PUERPERAL PYREXIA. Since the commencement of the new regulations 21 cases have been notified. 14 were removed to hospital and seven kept at home. GO to TABLE 43.

Of this number 3,009 rooms were disinfected after the occurrence of the ordinary notifiable infectious diseases, as against 3,215 rooms in 1925. 4,275 periodical sprayings of rooms occupied by Phthisical patients were also carried out during the year. 637 verminous rooms were sulphured and otherwise cleansed by the Council's staff during the year, as against 671 in 1925. Among the total number of disinfections (7,284) it was found necessary to strip 273 rooms. Of these 230 were in relation to the notifiable diseases and 43 after the termination of cases of Phthisis.

The Municipal Tuberculosis Dispensary is situated near the Elephant and Castle Underground Railway and convenient for all buses and trams. This central position renders one Dispensary adequate for the district as it can be reached from all parts without difficulty to the patients. A detailed account of the work done at the Tuberculosis Dispensary is tabulated at the end of my report. CO o> TABLE 48. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS, REGULATIONS, 1912.

There are in the Borough 10 Municipal Centres, Voluntary and partly Voluntary and partly Municipal for the attendance of mothers and children under 5 years of age. Sessions are also held for ante-natal work amongst expectant mothers. There is an assistant doctor to the Medical Officer of Health for maternity work and three part time doctors attached to other centres. There is also a Superintendent Health Visitor and 10 Health Visitors. The district being so well supplied with Maternity Wards in general Hospitals and childrens' Hospitals, and also having the York Road Lying-in Hospital extending its excellent work into the district, there is uo need for the Borough to undertake a Maternity Home or Hospital for babies on its own account. Ante-natal sessions are held every week at two Municipal Centres and the same is also done at the Maternity Centre of Guy's Hospital. Orthopædic Treathent.—This is undertaken by the London County Council and the General Hospitals in the Borough. The voluntary societies co-ordinating are the Invalid Childrens Aid Society, and the Southwark Invalid Kitchens Society, which both do good work. As all the children attending the centres are under 5 years of age there is no connection with the school medical service until they are transferred to school. 102 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE CENTRES.

APPENDIX. Borough of Southwark annual report of the Tuberculosis Medical Officer for the YEAR 1926. J. T. Crowe, L.S.A., L.M.S.S.A. (London), Tuberculosis Medical Officer. 110 BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Southwark Tuberculosis Dispensary, 82-84, Newington Causeway, S.B To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for the year 1926. The work of the Dispensary has been carried on on similar lines as heretofore, the staff consisting of a Secretary Dispenser and three Nurses. I am sorry to have to record that early in the year we lost the services of Nurse M. E. Faulkner through ill-health ; she had been in the service of the Dispensary ever since it was started in 1912, and was a most efficient worker, and she is greatly missed by all the Staff. Her place was taken by Nurse IT. H. Jay, who came to us from the Surrey County Council. We still send a large number of patients away unrier the London County Council scheme to sanatoria for treatment in definitely tubercular cases, and to hospitals for observation in doubtful cases. Now that the London County Council have two hospitals for advanced cases, one at Colindale in North London and the other at Grove Park in South London, we have been able to deal with more of this class of case than formerly. Under a new arrangement with the London County Council we are able now to get children away within a few hours of their cases being diagnosed, instead of having to wait some time for a vacancy. The London County Council also deal with a good number of children who were previously dealt with by the Invalid Children's Aid Association, in the way of convalescent treatment and also with the Boarding-Out Scheme for the children of tubercular patients. The Invalid Children's Aid Association has been a great help to us in dealing with a large number of delicate children, by sending them to various convalescent homes. Children also suffering from various forms of tuberculosis have been sent to Open-Air Schools under the London County Council on their return from Sanatoria, and pre-tubercular children to Stowey House School, also under the London County Council. 1ll I have tried, with success, in one or two cases of tubercular enlarged glands a treatment which has been used in Scotland and elsewhere for some years, namely, In-unction, with various strengths of tuberculin ointment, and hope in future to use it in a large number of cases. Under a new scheme with Guy's Hospital we send a number of patients for treatment with the Artificial Sunlight and Ultra-Violet Eays, this also has shown very good results in a number of cases. We still send cases to Guy's Hospital for X-Ray examination and reports in cases of doubt, this is often most useful. The Nurses have paid a large number of visits to the homes of the patients and do a very great amount of propaganda work in the way of teaching the patients and their friends how to prevent infection. We still have three shelters in constant use, and eight beds lent to patients for use in their own homes. 550 specimens of sputum have been examined by the Borough Analyst. The Care Committee, which meets at the Town Hall weekly, has been most active in its work of helping the patients themselves and their wives and families, while the patients are away in Institutions, also in various other ways. One patient has been in the south of France for over a year, taken there by a well-known lady to superintend the building of her own house. Another family with two delicate children in whom tuberculosis has never been diagnosed has emigrated to Australia. A fair number of patients have secured new houses on the London County Council Estates, and two patients have been granted houses by the Church Army, to get them into more healthy surroundings. Two of our patients have been continuously at work at the "Spero Leather Works" under the London County Council, and lately the London County Council have started a firewood factory for tuberculous ex-service men with definite pensions for tuberculosis, and we have got one or two patients into that also. Extra nourishment has been given to 38 patients while waiting admission to or on return from institutions. The Charity Organisation Society has also been a great help to us in the way of providing patients with clothing when going to sanatoria, and also in getting delicate but non-tuberculous patients to Convalescent Homes. 112 Ex-service patients have been looked after in conjunction with the Ministry of Pensions, the British Red Cross Society, the United Services Fund and the British Legion. 266 certificates recommending and renewing treatment allowance to these patients have been granted. The relationship with the local medical practitioners has been most cordial. I append tables and statistics of the work done during the year 1926.

Statistics of cases dealt with by the Tuberculosis Care Committee:— The Committee has met weekly to consider the assessment of cases recommended for Sanatorium or Hospital treatment, to see that they are provided with adequate clothes to go in, and to see that the families are provided for in the absence of the bread winners, and arrangements made for the children if the mother goes away. The Committee has no funds except a grant from the Ministry of Health for extra nourishment 116 for patients waiting for Institutional treatment, or until they start work on their return, administered by the Tuberculosis Officer and reported to Committee. Other cases needing help are referred to voluntary societies. Children's cases are all placed under the care of the I.C.A. who work in close conjunction with this Committee and the Tuberculosis Dispensary. During the year 219 adult cases, and 91 children have been before the Committee, of these 214 have been recommended for free treatment. 96 have contributed weekly sums varying from 1s. to 15s. 81 cases have been referred to the following Societies for help:— Charity Organization Society 34 United Services Fund 20 Soldiers' and Sailors' Help Society and various Regimental funds 11 Invalid Kitchen 7 Church 2 Variety Artistes' Benevolent Society 1 Society for Relief of Distress 2 Private individuals 7 Many more have been referred to the Invalid Kitchen, but the cost paid for by some of the above Societies. A good many cases not suitable for the voluntary societies, who can usually only help in temporary illness have been referred to the Poor Law Guardians, who co-operate closely with us and are represented on the Committee. Help given by Voluntary Societies consists of clothes, temporary allowances, sets of dentures, fares to visit relatives in sanatoria, help to move out of London, and children sent to homes during their parents' illness, &c. Employment is very difficult to find, but the Superintendent of the local Ministry of Labour Employment Exchange is a member of our Committee, and does his utmost to place cases referred to him by our Committee. Apart from the visits paid by the Dispensary Nurses other members of Committee visit nearly all cases returned from Institutional Treatment, and also visit families referred to them by hospitals for reports on their social conditions, and from Springwell House L.C.C. Open-Air School. 117 TABLE L. Death-rate from Pulmonary Tuberculosis for Southwark compared with the year 1925:— 1925. Southwark 1.02 per 1000 1926. Southwark 1.06 per 1000 TABLE M.
