Medical Officer of Health to the Council TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF E. HOUGHTON, Cert. R. San. Inst., Certificated Meat Inspector, Chief Sanitary Inspector. East Barnet Urban District Council. SEVENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1949. To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council. Mrs. Jackson and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1949. Milk Supply. It will be noticed from the report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector that a considerable number of samples of milk have again been examined. There can be no doubt that this sampling is of great value in the maintenance of a pure milk supply. Fortunately, practically all milk retailed in the district is pasteurised and this undoubtedly is the reason why unsatisfactory samples are few and far between. Every care is taken to ensure that clean milk only is sold in this area, but this depends on constant vigilance and supervision, and even so the human factor occasionally fails. Water Supply. The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. The Company have an up-to-date chemical and bacteriological laboratory in charge of which is a qualified chemist. During the year 1,482 examinations were made 98.30 per cent. being b. coli free in 100 c.c.'s. 1 Samples are also sent periodically to independent analysts in London for their examination and the following report is characteristic of such examinations:— “This is a clear and bright water free from odour and taste and neutral in re-action. It is hard in character, free from metals and contains no excess of saline matter. Both organically and bacteriologically the water is of a high degree of purity and is a pure and wholesome water suitable for public supply purposes." Twelve samples were also taken by us and submitted for examination. The reports were in every case satisfactory. Diphtheria Prophylaxis. Unfortunately I am not able to give the percentage figure of immunisation as the statistics are no longer available for individual urban districts. I do not, however, consider that our high percentage has fallen to any material extent. For the second year in succession no cases of Diphtheria have been notified. More attention is now being given to the "boosting" dose for the 5-7 year old group, and this will ensure further protection. It is noticeable that parents now seek to have their children immunised as a routine, and one can with some reason expect this attitude to continue. Scabies During the year 8 cases only of Scabies and contacts have been treated. There is a very marked decrease in the number of cases notified, and now that war-time conditions of Shelter Life and the Black-out have become things of the past, I would venture the opinion that we shall return to the pre-1939 conditions when Scabies was a most uncommon disease in this district. Infectious Diseases. During 1949 there was 1 death from Poliomyelitis—nevertheless it becomes apparent that this problem will be an increasing one, and the difficulty of tracing a source of infection becomes no less. The figures show little variation worthy of comment except perhaps to say that Measles tends to become more prominent each year. I regret that there is still considerable difficulty in obtaining supplies of convalescent measles serum for attenuation of the disease in suitable cases. Protective injection against Whooping Cough seems still to me to be of doubtful value, nor have I yet seen evidence to convince me otherwise. 1948 was a peak year for Whooping Cough, but as against the 2 remaining notifiable diseases there is surprisingly little variation in the statistics of last year. This remark is generally applicable to the other vital statistics, which repeat fairly accurately the national statistics. Tuberculosis The rise in notifications of cases of Tuberculosis is apparent, due perhaps mainly to earlier diagnosis. I have drawn attention on previous occasions to the close link between the tuberculosis problem and the housing problem, and the link has been accentuated by the very long waiting period before cases accepted as suitable for sanatorium treatment can be admitted. True, this problem is one for other authorities to solve, but it throws a considerable strain on local resources so far as housing is concerned, and I would like to repeat my thanks to the Housing Manager for his cooperation with the Public Health Department in the attempt to find suitable housing for cases of tuberculosis. Finally, in drawing attention to the mass of detailed work covercd by the report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector, I am sure that it is not necessary to comment on the condition of the houses in some of the older roads in the district. With the housing problem remaining acute, no more than a slow but steady progress towards removal of a few of the blacker spots can be achieved, or expected. I would like to express my most sincere thanks to the members of my staff for their untiring patience and perseverance throughout the year. Your obedient Servant, C. M. SCOTT, m.r.c.s. (eng.), l.r.c.p. (lond), Medical Officer of Health to the Council. 3 Area and Rateable Value. The area of the district is 2,644 acres. Registrar-General's estimate of resident population, 1949, 40,630. Rateable Value (at 31st December, 1949), £395,598. Product of a penny rate for 1949-50, £1,594. Vital Statistics. Total. M. F.

There were 547 births (20 illegitimate) during the year. The birth rate is 13.4 per 1,000 of the estimated resident population, as compared with 15.3 last year. The births last year numbered 613, including 22 illegitimate. Death Rate. There were 363 deaths (364 last year), giving a rate of 8.9 compared with 9T last year. Infantile Death Rate. There were 6 deaths of children under one year as compared with 9 last year, a death rate per 1,000 live births of 10.9. Last year the figure was 14.6 and for 1947 30.0. For England and Wales the rate was 32 for 1949 and 34 for 1948. Prevalence of, and Control Over, Infectious Diseases. With the exception of Mumps, all cases of infectious disease are now notifiable in the area, and particulars of those cases notified are given in Table 1. 4 With regard to Diphtheria, every facility for prompt diagnosis and treatment is placed at the disposal of local doctors, swabs for examinations of throat, etc., and a supply of antitoxin are kept in readiness at the Town Hall. In addition, the Council gives facilities for the supply of immunising serum. Similar facilities for bacteriological diagnosis are available in cases of Tuberculosis and other Infectious Diseases and full advantake is taken of them. In all infectious cases where patients are removed to isolation or special hospitals, the patient's home is visited and disinfection thoroughly carried out. Smallpox. No cases of this disease were notified during the year. Tuberculosis. A table is given showing new cases and mortality during 1949. Whenever possible, all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis likely to benefit are sent to the County Sanatorium at Ware. In every case thorough disinfection of the premises, etc., is carried out as soon as the patient has been removed. TABLE I.

The following is a list of repairs executed or work done as a result of inspections made or notices served:— No. of Houses. Roofs repaired and made weathertight 75 Spouts and downspouts cleaned and repaired or renewed 46 Interior walls repaired or replastered 72 Ceilings repaired or replastered 81 Walls and ceilings cleansed and distempered 38 Exterior brickwork repaired or repointed 39 Damp walls remedied 53 Stairs or staircases repaired 11 Broken sash cords renewed 21 Window frames repaired 45 Kitchen ranges repaired or renewed 18 9 No. of Houses Fireplaces repaired 22 Doors repaired 29 Door steps repaired or replaced 11 Dilapidated washing coppers repaired 8 Floors repaired or relaid 26 Scullery sinks renewed 6 Waste pipes repaired or renewed 15 Defective window sills repaired 11 Dilapidated dustbins renewed 25 Defective sub-floor ventilation remedied 8 Skirting boards repaired or replaced 6 Verminous premises fumigated, etc 13 Choked drains cleared 62 Defective vent pipes repaired 4 Broken inspection chamber covers replaced 5 Drains repaired or relaid 18 W.C.'s, fittings repaired or renewed.. 42 Storage cisterns cleansed 12 Cisterns repaired or renewed 14 Water supply re-instated after being cut off 6 Water pipes repaired 14 Accumulation of refuse removed 8 Nuisances arising from the keeping of animals, poultry, etc., remedied 5 Exterior paving repaired or relaid 7 Hot water systems repaired 9 Chimney pots and flues repaired 26 Insufficient water supply remedied 4 Defective covers to water tanks replaced 6 Lavatory basins renewed 5 Hearths repaired or renewed 4 Soil pipes repaired or renewed 4 Parapet walls repaired 2 Defective skylights repaired 2 Fresh-air inlets to drains repaired 5 Exterior balconies and steps repaired 5 Door porches repaired 2 Damp-proof courses provided 4 Site concrete provided 3 10 The costs of repairs have continued to increase until they are now about three times the pre-war costs. As property owners are unable to increase rents to meet these extra costs, many are reluctant to carry out any repairs other than those which are really necessary. In one case, where a notice under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, requiring repairs to a house, had not been complied with, the work was done in the owners' default at a cost of £212 Os. Id. Property Condemned as Unfit for Human Habitation. Six dwellings were reported as unfit for human habitation and incapable of repair at reasonable expense, in accordance with section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. These were:— 107, Leicester Road Semi-detached dwelling house 14, Warwick Cottages 4-roomed terrace house 54, Edward Road 5-roomed terrace house 56, Edward Road 5-roomed terrace house 21, Henry Road 9-roomed terrace house 7, Somerset Road Basement 3-roomed flat I estimated the cost of the works necessary to render these houses in all respects fit for human habitation and the value that the dwellings would have when the works were completed to be as follows:— Estimated cost of works Estimated value on completion £ £ 107, Leicester Road 495 625 14, Warwick Cottages 342 190 54, Edward Road 267 175 56, Edward Road 357 190 21, Henry Road 1,482 550 7, Somerset Road 265 300 The owners of 107, Leicester Road, 21, Henry Road, and 7, Somerset Road did not contest the statements regarding the unfitness of these properties, the estimated cost of works and valuation were not disputed, and they did not attend before the Committee after notices under Section 11 of the Act had been served upon them notifying them of their right to be heard when the matter of Demolition or Closing Orders were to be considered. Demolition Orders were therefore duly made in respect of 107, Leicester Road, and 21, Henry Road, and a Closing Order for the basement flat at 7, Somerset Road. The owner of 107, Leicester Road, later changed her mind and lodged an appeal with the County Court against the Demolition Order. This appeal was withdrawn just before the date of the hearing and the Order then became operative. 11 No. 14 Warwick Cottages, and 54 and 56, Edward Road, were owned by one person, and this owner appeared before the Committee after notice of her right to be heard had been served. She was not willing to carry out the works of reconditioning in respect of No. 14, Warwick Cottages, and a Demolition Order was thereupon made. As regards No. 54, Edward Road, the owner stated she was prepared to carry out all the works specified and to give an undertaking to that effect. She stated, however, that it was not practicable to do all the works whilst the house was occupied, and consideration of this matter was deferred pending a decision regarding an offer of temporary alternative accommodation for the tenant. No. 56, Edward Road, became vacant, the tenant being rehoused by the Housing Manager under the "Points" scheme, and it was decided that an undertaking to carry out the necessary works would be accepted. Rat Destruction Two hundred and fifteen complaints of rat infestation were received (102 in 1948). The Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, was administered by the County Council until 31st March, 1949, when their powers under the Act were delegated to us from 1st April. An agreement was made with the Barnet Urban District Council for the appointment of a rodent operative to carry out the necessary duties jointly for the two districts, and an operative was appointed and commenced his duties on 2nd May. The annual 10 per cent. test of the sewer manholes to ascertain the extent of rat infestation of the sewers was again carried out at the request of the Rodent Control Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture. Test baits of sausage rusk were laid in 165 manholes, and when inspected two days afterwards only four of the baits had completely disappeared, and in 10 manholes, part only of the baits had been consumed, and these "takes" were all in one area. A treatment of the area concerned was then undertaken, with the result that there were 10 manholes where the poison baits had been only partly consumed. These results were somewhat similar to those of last year and are a proof that rat infestation of the sewers is very slight. Full particulars were supplied to the Infestation Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. The rodent operative later tendered his resignation which took effect from 1st October. It was then decided to approach the Barnet Urban District Council with a view to a separate operator being appointed for each district as experience had proved that there was sufficient work in this district to justify the appointment of a wholetime operative, and the delegated duties could better be performed by the two authorities working separately. 12 National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50, Burial or Cremation of the Dead One funeral of a destitute person was arranged under this Act at a cost of £9 12s. 6d. The order for the funeral was given to Messrs. E. Treeves, Ltd., of Willesden, the interment being at the Great Northern London Cemetery. The widow of the deceased expressed her thanks to us and to Messrs. Treeves for the arrangements made and for the way in which the funeral was carried out. Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts One certificate was granted to a tenant that the house he occupied, 54, Edward Road, was not in a reasonable state of repair. This house was reported as an unfit house under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. Verminous Houses. Ten privately owned houses, two council houses and one requisitioned house were found to be infested with insects. All were disinfested by stripping and burning wallpaper and spraying with "Zaldecide" or "Cooper's D.D.T." liquid insecticide. 13 Factory Inspections. FACTORIES ACT, 1937.

The following licences were granted to dealers to sell under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936-43:— Tuberculin Tested 3 Pasteurised 4 The following Supplementary licences under principal licences granted by other authorities to sell milk from premises outside this area were also granted:— Tuberculin Tested 8 Pasteurised 8 Ninety-nine samples of milk were purchased and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Ministry of Health's Emergency Public Health Laboratory, at Hertford. The following is a summary of the results of the examinations:— No. of Samples Submitted. Test applied:— (a) Methylene blue. (b) b. coli. Result of Examination. (c) Phosphatase.

In the case of unsatisfactory samples, visits were paid to the premises of the dairy concerned and investigations made into the cause of the unsatisfactory report, or if the premises were outside our area a letter was sent to the particular person or firm pointing out that the report was not satisfactory and asking for an investigation. The percentage of unsatisfactory samples was 9. The previous year it was 3 per cent.; in 1947, 9 per cent.; in 1946, 6 per cent.; in 1945, 10 per cent.; in 1944, 7 per cent.; in 1943, 9 per cent.; in 1942, 18 per cent.; in 1941, 33 per cent. All the eight unsatisfactory samples of T.T. Certified milk were from one dairy company's supply which the Company obtained from a farm in Essex, and was sold by them exactly as received, in bottles. The matter was reported to the County Health Inspector for Essex, who investigated matters at the farm. It was decided that notice should be served on the Company, that the Council proposed "to consider the suspension or revocation of the supplementary licence to retail Tuberculin Tested Certified 14 milk issued to them under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936, and, to afford them a reasonable opportunity of making representations with regard thereto, they were invited to send representatives to attend the meeting of the Committee at which the matter would be considered. Two directors of the Company attended the meeting and stated that the milk in question was produced on a farm licensed by the Essex County Council. The milk was bottled at the farm in accordance with the Regulations, and it was quite impossible for the Company to exercise any control over the milk. As a result of the adverse reports a member of the Company's senior laboratory staff had spent some time at the farm and had advised the farm manager as to the steps that might be taken to improve the quality of the milk. However, the Company had decided to discontinue taking milk from this farm, and in future only milk of this grade from their own farm in Finchley would be retailed in this district, which would ensure that the delay between production and retail of the milk would be lessened. It was decided that the explanation put forward by the Company be accepted, and that in view of the steps that had been taken by them, no further action be taken in the proposed suspension or revocation of the licence. Four samples of this grade were afterwards taken at intervals from this firm's supply, and all were reported as being satisfactory and within the standard for that grade. Ice Cream. Certificates of Registration were granted in respect of twelve premises for the sale of ice cream. Forty-two visits of inspection were paid to registered premises, all of which were found satisfactory. Meat Inspection. The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been duly observed as regards the butchers' shops in the district. Inspection of Other Foods. All restaurants, snack bars, fried fish shops and other places where food is prepared have been visited and their kitchens and cooking utensils inspected for cleanliness. Water heaters have been fixed at our request in ten foodpreparing premises where there was no satisfactory hot-water supply, in order to maintain a constant supply of hot and cold water, to encourage personal cleanliness on the part of proprietors and assistants engaged in the sale or preparation of food, 15 Food Condemned as unfit for Human Consumption.
