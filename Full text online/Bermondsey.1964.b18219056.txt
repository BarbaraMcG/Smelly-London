Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, This will be the last Annual Report of the Officer of Health of Bermondsey as such. At the Ministry of Health's direction the report for the first quarter of 1965 will be included in the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the London Borough of Southwark. This final report must, of necessity, be tempered with a clear regret at the passing of an era in which many fine achievements were made. It is not possible to list all of these but it is important to dwell a little on the two most outstanding services. 1. Imported Food. It is well known that Tooley Street has meant, and means, food importation on a huge scale. No. 1 London Bridge, is the headquarters of the London Provision Exchange. The close liaison with the trade has led to the efficient inspection, examination and sampling of foodstuffs in the most expeditious way. In view of the tonnage involved (approximately one million tons annually), this is in reality a considerable service to the nation since distribution is nationwide. It was, therefore, realistic when on 16th November, 1964, the Minister of Health decided that the request of the Corporation of London to take over responsibility of the riverside wharves of the Riparian Boroughs in respect of imported food should not be acceded to. Since this decision a meeting of Riparian Medical Officers of Health and Health Inspectors has been held at the London Provision Exchange, Bermondsey, under my Chairmanship, and it is proposed to hold future meetings there. I am sure I can speak for the Bermondsey Council in expressing our thanks for the services of the Public Health Inspectors who have a wealth of experience in food importation. 2. Old People's Welfare. This service was second to none and the Council's expressed wish of doing everything possible for the aged was fully implemented by the staff. The clubs, both voluntary and municipal, played a vital role in the scheme of things. The statutory services were used to the full. The public health assistants did an excellent job and helped to humanise these services, seeing that the best was obtained for the aged. House to house visiting, covering the borough as a whole ensured the compilation of a practical register with details of virtually all the aged in the borough. The full details of the survey carried out and the action taken will be published later. Again, I know the Council will approve my thanks to all who helped to make this service such a success. May I extend my thanks to members of the Council and to the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement during the year, also to all members of the staff for their help and loyal support. 1 am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. E. EPSOM. VITAL STATISTICS. AREA The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres.

The staff engaged in this work maintained the high standard of co-operation with the organisation who are also concerned with the welfare of old people. Full use has been made of the domiciliary bathing service and the bathing service provided at the Council's cleansing station. An average of 45 persons per week were provided for either in their own homes or in the cleansing station. The demand for meals on wheels showed a slight decrease during the year as will be seen from the following tables. The cost of these meals were raised from 2/3 d. to 2/6drbut the Council were able to avoid having to increase their charges to old people. The week-end meals service provided with the co-operation of Guy's Hospital showed an increase on the previous year. This, of course, was not due to demand but because more people in need of this particular service were brought to the attention of the department. The Luncheon Club opened by the Women's Voluntary Service towards the end of last year for a trial period of three months proved to be the success hoped for. By the end of the year plans were being made for the club to be opened four days in each week instead of two. The Council were able to give financial aid to assist the W.V.S. in securing improvements to their kitchen by way of extending the water supply and installing a sink. The following table sets out the number of meals provided during the year: Meals on Wheels Municipal Club Weekend Meals W.V.S. Luncheon Club January 2,941 1,059 246 234 February 2,656 956 302 232 March 2,645 1,082 394 254 April 2,834 961 296 252 May 2,599 1,236 412 216 June 2,841 964 304 226 July 3,001 1,121 285 215 August 2,507 971 405 222 September 2,893 1,248 299 267 October 2,953 1,256 338 287 November 2,645 1,324 322 273 December 2,494 928 227 363 33,009 13,106 3,830 3,081 (1963) 33,056 12,185 2,460 561 Arrangements were made for fireguards to be fitted in the home for 27 elderly people. During the year 65 articles of home nursing equipment were loaned on behalf of the Red Cross. MUNICIPAL CLUB During the seventh year of its existence the Club again showed an increase in its membership. The regular visits to the theatre were continued and members attended performances of 'Half a Sixpence , ' Black and White Minstrel Show ', ' Man in the Moon , and Billy Smart s Circus. The members went to Eastbourne for their yearly outing and they were accompanied for the day by the Mayor and Mayoress and other Members of the Council. Two further outings were made to Hastings during the Spring and Autumn. Another trip was made to Holtspur in Berkshire where the members were able to renew their associations with the local branch of the Women's Institute. The handicapped section of the Club were not forgotten and they were taken out for a day at Southsea. We were able to improve the opportunities for these people to join in the Club's activities when two ambulance type vehicles were purchased. One of these, which is fitted with a lift at the rear, was allocated for use at the Municipal Club. This allowed us to cancel the existing special transport arrangements which only permitted the handicapped to be taken to the Club one day in each week and to substitute a five day week service for them. The second vehicle was allocated to the Meals on Wheels service. Improvements to the kitchen were carried out during the middle of the year, and when completed alternative arrangements were made for the provision of meals by the introduction of frozen food. These new arrangements, which proved to be greatly appreciated by the members, allowed a greater improvement both in the quality and the range of meals supplied. The Road Safety Officer gave two film shows during the year, and a group of girls from the Aylwin School entertained the members with their dancing and singing. These items helped to supplement the normal programme of entertainment arranged for the members. The work undertaken during the year by the members in the workrooms, concerned the preparation of stationery, cutting braids for braces and assembling suspender belts. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948 Section 47 During the year under report no cases were encountered which warranted compulsory action under the provisions of Section 47, or of the Amendment Act of 1951. One old person agreed voluntarily to be admitted to a residential home and the necessary arrangements were made. Section 50 It is the Council's responsibility under this Section of the Act to arrange for burial or cremation of a person dying in the Borough when there are no relatives, or other persons, prepared to make the funeral arrangements. Where possible in such cases the Council's expenses, inclusive of an administrative charge, are recoverable from the deceased's estate. During the year 2 burials were arranged at the request of the Coroner's Office. No relatives could be traced in one case and in the other the deceased's wife was destitute, her four children having been taken into the care of the L.C.C. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT 1936, SECTION 122 The Council are authorised to remove and cleanse personal effects where the Medical Officer considers that the condition of such articles is likely to cause the spread of infectious disease. During the year the Medical Officer visited the homes of certain old people who were seriously ill or senile. Quantities of soiled bedding and personal clothing were found in each case and it was necessary for these articles to be regularly collected for cleansing in the Disinfecting Station and returned to the owners.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH The Borough Council completed 101 dwellings, 449 were in course of erection at the end of the year and plans for 657 were prepared or in course of preparation, 222 families from the waiting list, clearance areas etc. have been rehoused and 225 transfers and exchanges were arranged. This has resulted in 447 families being provided with improved accommodation by the Borough Council. 504 families were rehoused by the London County Council and 12 families were accommodated in new towns. 10 E.F.M.
