Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my thirtyfirst Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for tbe year 1917. It will be seen that the death-rate, which had fallen 3 per 1,000 in 1916, has increased during the year under consideration. Measles was unusually prevalent during the whole of the year, although not quite to the same extent as in 1916. The Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme has progressed during the year, and more Centres have been opened. There has been a great increase in the work of inspection of food at the wharves on the River bank, and a large quantity of damaged food was condemned. The sanitary work of the district was carried out in a satisfactory manner, although a large proportion of the inspectoral staff was on Active Service. 1 have to thank the Council and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors. of the Borough of Southrvark. 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS, 1917.

All matters, however, relating to health have been carried out after some delay. The people upon the whole,.owing to much higher wages—a rise on an average of 100 per cent—have never before been so well clothed and fed. The working 3 classes during the fourth year of the war have enjoyed a prosperity unheard of in years gone by. The supply of vehicular accommodation, iu the way of omnibuses, tramcars and others, has fallen far short of the demand. A part of this has been due to the lessened number of vehicles on the streets, but the chief cause has been the increased number of women workers engaged iu the City and central parts of the metropolis, who, within certain hours, have to go to and from their work. An increased means of traffic needs serious consideration. The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1902, 1903, 1904,1905, 1906,1907,1908,1909, 1910, 1912,1913,1914,1915, 1916 and 1917. 1841 Newington. 54,693 St. George's.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1917 was 3,770, of which 1,924 were males, and 1,846 females. This represents a birth-rate of 22.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 2,351; St. George the Martyr, 1,032; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 387. Of the 3,770 births registered in the borough 62 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the borough. 427 births occurring in various lying-in and other institutions outside the borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar-General. When the 62 "outward " transfers are deducted and the 427 "inward" transfers are added to the 3,770 births actually registered in the borough, the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 4,135. This gives a corrected birth-rate of 24'6. 5 Birth-rate for the last Twenty-six Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington.

These deaths in institutions comprised 598 belonging to Southwark and 565 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,154. When the 595 deaths of those persons who were non-parishioners, but who died in our Borough, have been deducted, and the 1,154 " outlying" deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the sanitary area is found to be 3,087, of which number 1,709 were males and 1,378 females. The death-rate when calculated on this " corrected'' number is 18 3 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1917, as against a rate of 17.1 for 1916. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 37.3. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

No case of this disease was notified during the year 1917. No death from Small-Pox has occurred in the borough within the last thirteen years. SCARLET FEVER. During the year under consideration 276 cases were notified and only seven deaths, which is, with the exception of last year when there were live deaths, one of the lowest on record. The notifications were the fewest in number since the notification of infectious diseases was instituted. The cases were pretty evenly distributed throughout the borough and the deaths were confined to three wards. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was: — In Southwark In London.

The deaths in the 263 cases sent to hospital numbered 7, a mortality of 2'6 per cent. The annual rate of mortality was 0.04. 56 DIPHTHERIA. There has been a distinct increase during the last few vears in the number of cases of Diphtheria notified, although for the particular vear under consideration there is a slight decrease. This has been attributed somewhat to the general unrest in the lives of the children and to the lessened parental care bestowed upon them. Picture Palaces may have had a share in the increase. The total notifications numbered 580 and the deaths 46 for the year. The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was 7.9. The annual mortality per 1,000 inhabitants was 0.27.

During the first week of July, 1917, the National Baby Week was inaugurated, when much propaganda work was done. A Committee was formed in the Borough of Southwark which made arrangements for meetings. Two open-air meetings were held—one at Faraday Gardens, Walworth, the other at the Recreation Grounds in Union Road. Each mother, the birth of whose child had been notified during the year, had an invitation by card to meet the Mayor and Mayoress. In welcoming these mothers the Mayor and Mayoress reminded them of the advantages to be derived by their attendance at an Infant Welfare Centre, and advised the mothers to take their babies to the Centre nearest their homes where they would receive every attention and advice from the doctor. A band was in attendance and tea was provided, which added greatly to the success of the meetings. During the Week a Mothercraft Exhibition was held at the Public Hall, Manor Place Baths, and opened each day by a member of the Borough Council and others, who explained to the mothers the reasons for holding a Baby Week. Each Centre had a stall illustrating their several activities. There was also a Dental stall. Cookery Demonstrations were given on three days by the staff of the Borough Polytechnic. Music was provided. The children of St. M try's School gave a Patriotic programme, and the children of Sayer Street School danced some Morris Dances, which greatly pleased the mothers. Announcements were made on the screens at the Cinemas giving the addresses of the Infant Welfare Centres, the days and time of meeting and a cordial invitation to the general public to visit the Centres during Baby Week.

Under our agreement with the London County Council, 1,200 children were cleansed. It was found necessary in a large number of cases to treat the children twice and sometimes three or four times before they were found to be effectually cleansed. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 83 adults sent from the various common lodging houses aud other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 80 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1916. 69 TABLE 39.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Tuberculosis Medical Officer FOR THE YEAR 1917. Horace Wilson, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., Tuberculosis Medical Officer and Assistant Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: T, Cornell & Sons, General Printers 62 and 63, Borough Road, S.E BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Southwark Tuberculosis Dispensary, 82-84, Newington Causeway, S.E. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. Sir and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of work done at the Tuberculosis Dispensary during the year 1917, which shows a considerable increase on the work done in any preceding year. There has been a larger attendance of adult patients this being due to the number of cases sent by the Recruiting Boards and the Ministry of Pensions for examination and report, and to the fact that notification is now the rule rather than the exception, which enables the dispensary to get into touch with cases and to encourage them to apply there for advice as to suitable treatment. The total attendances have also shown a great increase over the two preceding years as shown in Table E. The home visitation by the nurses has resulted in better conditions and an increased number of visits have been paid by them with the objects of giving the patients and their relatives instructions as to the prevention of infection and bringing contact cases to the dispensary for examination, while the sanitary condition of the houses has been under the supervision of the Public Health Department, which has also carried out where necessary spraying, stripping and cleansing of rooms, and the disinfection of the bedding. The granting of extra rations to patients suffering from Tuberculosis has been a great benefit, and patients who had lost weight on normal rations to a marked degree soon showed a definate increase when their allowance of meat and fats was supplemented, and their general condition showed improvement also. This was to be expected, as consumption is a wasting disease, and the results fully bore out the wisdom of the grant of extra nourishment. It also had a second advantage, which was that patients who were inclined to be dilatory in their attendance became 3 more punctual when the question of getting additional food coupons arose. As regards Institutional treatment, it is easier to get men to avail themselves of it than women. The women will not leave their families if they can help it, which is unfortunate because coming in closer daily contact with the children than their husbands do they are more likely to prove a source of infection. The men, however, frequently do not stay their allotted time at an Institution so readily as the women, but finding the restrictions more irksome discharge themselves before their period has expired, for trivial and frequently invented excuses. The women settle down more contentedly and rarely discharge themselves unless for some good and valid reason. There is still a tendency among the public to consider Sanatorium treatment as merely a question of fresh air, and to think they can derive equal benefit from a visit to relatives in the country without considering the fact that while in a Sanatorium they are under the care of doctors who have made a special study of the disease from which they suffer, while living under the best possible conditions. The After-Care Committee has done much further useful work and meets fortnightly to consider cases needing their assistance. Considerable difficulty is found in obtaining suitable employment for consumptives who are rarely fit for any continuous or prolonged exertion, and it is found that country work and farm work is generally more than they can manage. The monotony of country life to those to whom much that it holds is meaningless, the want of interests in common with the other villagers, and the lack of congenial companionship drives them back to the towns. There is already plenty of tuberculosis in the country districts, and the mere change from town to country air without any improvement in other respects is not going to effect a cure nor prevent the spread of infection. The task of finding suitable employment for tuberculous Soldiers is by no means an easy one, but the Labour Bureau, the Care Committee, and the Pensions Board have been able to find work for a good many. The openings suitable for such cases is so limited and their lack of energy, muscular power, and endurance is so marked that they are 4 suited only for employments in which no call is made on their reserve strength. The continuance of the war has added greatly to the usefulness of the dispensary, and the extra work has been done cheerfully and ungrudgingly by all concerned. My thanks are due to my staff for their steady energy, and to the Public Health Department, Pensions Board and Care Committee, for their co-operation in making the problem of the prevention and elimination of Tuberculosis nearer solution. I have pleasure in appending a number of tables which epitomise the work accomplished in the year. I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HORACE WILSON, Tuberculosis Officer. 5 TABLE A.
