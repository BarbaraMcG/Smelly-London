During the same period 109 births have been registered. Epidemic disorders are still prevalent, scarlatina, measles, and whooping cough, and two or three cases of smallpox, which have been generally brought from London, but which disease has not spread in this locality. In Seven cases of smallpox whieh have occurred within the last twelvemonth, I have elearly traced the infection to the house of the laundress; the linen having been washed and got up in a house in which smallpox has occurred. I cannot too strongly urge the great importance of vaccination, and of re-vaccination after a lapse of seven or eight years, to put a stop to this disease. Thirteen deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, viz.: — Blackheath— 29th March, Smallpox, Blackheath Park. 4th April, Measles, Tranquil Vale. Lewisham— 23rd March, "Whooping cough, Union Workhouse.

Several nuisances require your order for their removal, especially as from the absence of any rainfall, they are now peculiarly offensive. A cesspool near Mr. Gillmore'a (Carpenter), Loampit Hill, Lewisham (said to receive the sewage from Mr. Lee's property), requires emptying and filling in, and that the drainage should be carried into the sewer, as it is a most offensive nui-ancc. Complaints have also been received of the offensive smell fron a drain in front of I field Villa, Forest Hill, and Ashbourne Lodge in the same locality. The old water-course receives sewage from Laurie Park, Sydenham, and is still a source of complaint from its offensive contamination. Complaints on this subject have been received from Mr. Beale, Lower Sydenham, and from Mr. Rush, through whose premises this offensive stream passes. Complaints from the residents in Manor Road have been received as to the state of the pond or portion of old canal near the Forest Hill station which is said still to receive sewage from some of the old houses on Forest Hill, and which has recently been offensive from decomposing vegetable and animal matter upon its edges. The presence of scarlet fever in Manor Road, renders this matter ofadditional importance. The premises at the rear of the "Rock and Fountain" Inn, Upper Sydenham, still require attention; the state of the cow-yard and piggeries being prejudicial to the health of the neighbouring inhabitants.

Four deaths have t.aken place between the ages of 70 and 80 years, and two between the ages of 80 and 90. Nine from consumption of the lungs, and four from inflammatory affections of the lungs. Ten deaths have token place from epidemic disease in the under-mentioned localities. 22nd April, Starlet fever, Kirkdalc, Sydenham. 26th „ Scarlet fever, Kirkdolc, Sydenham. 23nd ,, Diarrhoea, Lower Sydenham. 30th ,, Typhoid fever, Sydenham Park. 30th „ Measles, Prospect Cottage, Sydenham. 5th May, Measles, Wells Road. 5th „ Measles, Wells Road. 7 th „ Scarlet fever, Laurie Park. 19th „ Scarlet fever, Laurie Park. 15th „ Measles, Windsor Terrace, Wells Road. S. Scarlet fever has been very prevalent in this district and fatal in its character; four deaths from this disease enumerated in the above list have occurred in two families. (1 he covered boundary ditch in Laurie Park, between the parish of Beckcnham and hamlet of Penge, and over which a portion of a house in Laurie Park is situate, is at times very offensive.) Measles and whooping cough are also prevalent. These two epidemic diseases are now affecting the children in the North Surrey School, where also opthalmia has been prevalent Four cases of smallpox have Oecurred in one house in West Kent Park, but the disease is not prevalent, and no deaths are registered from this cause. The prevalence however of the disease in other localities has had the effect of stimulating a large number of persons in this district to become vaccinated; a desire that should be encouraged amongst others, at the presence of a number of unvuccinated persons in the district is certain to favour the propagation of smallpox. In case of which disease occurring, what remains to bo done is to afford means for the conveyance, reception, and treatment of persons Buffering with this disease. On this subjeot a circular has been issued by the "Association of Medical Officers of Health" of the Metropolis, in which it is argued that "whenever a case of smallpox occurs in a populous locality, that the parties ought, in the interests of public health, to bo removed as soon as possible," and they advise that temporary buildings be opened in such situations as may be best suited for the purpose. The number of persons who have taken this disease in this district has been so minute, that such adviee may appear to be inapplicable ; but it is to be remembered that although the cases are limited in number, the danger in each case of allowing the patient to remain in his own residence, and the consequent necessity for removal, remain as great. Although no case of smallpox has occurred at the North Surrey School, children are occasionally received from houses in which the disease has occurred, therefore the "Board of Management" have, in consequence of my recommendation, ordered a temporary hut to bo erected in the adjoining field for the reception of any case which may possibly appear in that establishment, Penge— A report was presented to the Board some months back detailing the offensive state of the " Poole River," and the consequent contamination of the " Ravensbourne the large quantity of sewage poured into it. This evil has been, and is, continua y increasing in consequence of the increase in the number of houses and inhabitants, an should the summer be a dry one, these streams must become little other than Filth open sewers, and most prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants near to them , it is fore urgently required that something should be done to connect the drainage o Penge with that of Lewisham. Sydenham— The drainage of Wells Road requires attention. Springfield, Wells road is still 8 in a most offensive state from want of sewer accommodation. In the houses of Messrs. Tyler and Sutley the drains are blocked, and a pool of sewage remains close by tbe bouse. Lewisham— The premises of Mr. Lamb, butcher, Lewisham, complained of as being sometimes in a dirty state from want of care and cleanliness. Accumulations of manure and offal should be daily removed, or must become prejudicial to the health of the neighbourhood. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality arc appended as usual.

The mortality of the district is considerably below the average for the last eight years, when taking into account the increase of population ; indeed, it is little above the average if the number of the population had remained stationary. Sporadic cases of smallpox, also of measles, and scarlatina, continue to be prevalent in the district, sometimes very severe in character, but the mortality from epidemic disease has been small, thus— 15th June, Scarlet fever, Lower Sydenham. 11th ,, Diarrhoea, Lewisham. 25th May Measles, North Surrey District School (Anerlcy). 26th „ Scarlet fever, Laurie Park, Penge. Opthalmia still continues to be prevalent at the North Surrey District Schools, but is much mitigated in severity. A nuisance existing at the back of the " British Schools," Loampit Vale, requires your order for its removal. Pigs are kept in the gardens of Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, Hanover 9 Street, and the styes are erected within a few feet of the School. The offensive smell is prejudicial to the health 0f the children, and as 170 pupils are educated there it becomes important to remedy such a state of things at as early a period as possible.

During the corresponding space of time last year, 42 deaths were registered. The mortality of the district is considerably below the average for the last eight years, when taking into consideration the increase of population. The district is decidedly more free from epidemic disease than it has been for the last few months ; but cases of smallpox, scarlatina, and measles have affected the health o persons, and three deaths from epidemic disease arc registered, thus— Scarlet fever, King Street, Blackheath. Scarlet fever, Sydenham Hill, Sydenham. Measles, North Surrey District School, Penge. Measles still continue endemic at the North Surrey Schools, but only four fresh cases have occurred during the month. The opthalmia which has aflected the childien at the above schools has materially diminished in intensity. The sewage from Laurie Park, thence running in the meadows at the back of Messrs Batt's, Bcale's, and Dawson's property, has become blocked near the toll gat in Pengelane lane and requires attention. Dustbins are required at the back of Mr. Fox's houses in paxton park. The drainage of this locality requires early attention.

An innucst was also held upon the body of a man named Cburcher, who was supposed to have died of want; vcrdict—" Death from natural causes." Epidemic disease still continues prevalent. Diarrtoea has been more than ordinarily severe in character. Cases of smallpox exist in two families in West Kent Park. A severe case of typhus fovcr has occurred in a child admitted but a few days before into the "North Surrey School" at Anerlcy. The roads upon the left side of Loampit Vale, Lewisham, arc still in a dirty and unhealthy condition and require some attention before the winter sets in.

A case of typhus fever imported from Croydon into the North Surrey District school has spread to another child in that establishment. , The opthalmia which has been cndemic in that institution has very much dec decined in intensity. Thirty deaths have taken place in the district during the past four weeks. During the same period last year 38 deaths took place. . Four deaths have taken place from consumption of the lungs; two from information of the lungs; five in the under-mentioned localities from zymotic disease, thus . Measles, Paxton Park, Sydenham.

During the same space of time in 1861, 48 deaths were registered, and during 4 weeks at the corresponding period last year, 31 deaths were recorded. I he mortality is not above the average at this period of the year. Six deaths have taken place from epidemic disease in the undermentioned localities : — Female, 1 year. Whooping cough, Granville Park, Blackheath. Female, 5 months. Diarrhoea, Avenue Road, Lewisham. Male, 9 months. Diarrhoea, The Retreat, Lewisham. Male, 19 years. Gastric fever, The Grove, Lewisham.

Typhus fever, North Surrey School, Penge. 1 wo deaths only have taken place from inflammatory affections of the lungs, and five from consumption. A labourer was killed at Penge in consequence of falling from a scaffold. A female died suddenly from disease of the heart in the Crystal Palace waiting room. Oases of scarlet fever, whooping cough, and measles, are still occurring in this district. Smallpox is epidemic at Blackheath. In seven out of nine houses which comprise a court called Phoenix Square, the inhabitants have been attacked by this disease; a case also has occurred in "Bath Place." I have many times brought a representation of the 13 filthy and dilapidated state of this locality (Phœnix Square) before the Board; but it is still in us bad a state as when reported upon in the year 1856 (with the exception that drainage has been carried out ). Therefore it was deemed necessary to apply for an order to cleanse and repair to the Police Magistrate, who adjudged that—" What was necessary to be done should be carried out in 18 hours." "Jews Passage." The houses in Jews Passage were drained by order of the Board of Works some years ago, but water supply is still wanting to all the houses, without which drainage is incomplete. Epidemic opthalmia still continues prevalent at the North Surrey District Schools (in common with several pauper institutions in the country), although it has for some weeks declined considerably in intensity. The exaggerated newspaper reports upon this subject arc not founded on fact. "Russell Square," Blackheath. The ground floors of all the houses in Russell Square are a few inches below the level of the ground outside. One of the gullies is completely blocked up, and the only remaining one is insufficient to carry off the rainfall. A mound of earth at the entrance of the Square also prevents any exit for water in that direction, so that after a heavy shower the water runs upon and underneath the floors of the houses. A house at the end of the Square is very offensive in consequence of the disturbance of an old cesspool during the construction of Mr. Glenton's stables adjoining. A dyer, whose premises stand at the entrance of the Square, is said to empty his refuse dye liquor upon the ground, which soaks under the floors of the houses adjacent. Water supply is also wanted here. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Weak euding Weight of Air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches.

Four deaths have taken place from consumption of the lungs, and three from inflammatory affections of the lungs. Smallpox is still prevalent in some parts of the district, namely, at Blackheath, and at West Kent Park, Sydenham, consequently it has been deemed requisite in several instances to apply to the magistrates for power to compel the owners to put their houses in a proper sanitary condition, such as would tend to prevent the spread of disease. Measles has also been epidemic and two deaths have been registered from this cause. At the Police Station, Sydenham, four cases of measles have occurred. Cases of typhoid fever and diarrhoea have also occurred. A mild form of scarlntina has attacked persons in several parts of the district. Epidemic catarrh or influenza is also very prevalent. The opthalmia endemic at the North Surrey Schools has considerably declined in intensity, and the inmates of the establishment may be pronounced in a very healthy condition. The largely increasing prevalence of typhus fever in the Metropolis, has been under consideration at a meeting of the Association of Medical Officers of Health, when it was determined to send the circular appended to this report, for the consideration of tho local authorities in the several metropolitan districts, with a view to the adoption of such measures as may prevent or check the spread of the disease in the coming winter. "Metropolitan Association of Mcdical Officers of Health. Session 1863-4. Memorandum concerning the present prevalence of Typhus Fever in London. November 21st, 1863. 1. Epidcmic typhus, beginning in London at the end of 1861, has of late experienced a very considerable increase. The admissions for typhus into the London Fever Hospital, which were 66 in August, rose to 97 in September, to 235 in October, and have now reached above 200 in the first three weeks of November. As this disease usually increases as the weather becomes colder, reaching its greatest prevalence in the spring, this rapid and early rise in the number of typhus cases appears to forebode a considerable epidemic in the coming winter. 2. The disease appears to have experienced increase very universally throughout London, but chiefly in the poor and thickly populated districts of the East and South. 3. The Loudon Fever Ilofepital is able to admit about 250 cases a month, and the projected increase in its accommodation will permit of its receiving about 330 cases a month. It may safely be asserted that even this latter extent of accommodation will not suffice for all the cases of typhus that will arise in London. 4. The best ascertained cause of typhus fever is the over-crowding of dirty and halfstarved people in small ill-ventilated rooms. This is positively the condition under which the fever spreads, when once produced, with greatest certainty and malignity. 5. There is very considerable risk in treating typhus cases along with other patients in the wards of workhouses and general hospitals. Experience has shown that when so treated, a quarter of the mortality from typhus has been among nurses or other persons who have contracted the disease within the workhouse or hospital; while in hospitals specially provided for isolating the sick, only one in every 37 deaths from typhus has been that of a person contracting the disease in the hospital, and even this degree of danger is lessened when the isolation of patients is rigorous and complete. In view of these facts, the principles that the Association would urge as of chief efficacy to control the spread of typhus are :— 1. That in no instance, where removal is practicable, should a typhus patient be retained in the house where the disease has originated. 15 2. That adequate provision should at once be made by cach district for the reception and treatment, with proper isolation, of a considerable number of typhus eases during the ensuing winter. 3. That, at the present time, the overcrowding of small tenements should in a special manner receive the attention of sanitary officers. 4. That, as occasion may arise the connection between privation and typhus should be instated on, with a view to the adoption of liberal relief to the poor, in respect of food, tiring, and clothing. with reference to the accommodation for casual paupers, it may be necesaary to call attention to the adequacy or inadequacy of the existing vagrant wards. And considering that typhus fever is at any time liable to be introduced into such wards, attention may w 11 be directed to their construction and management. (On behalf of tho Association), R. D. Thomson, President. Geokoe Buchanan} J. Northcote Vinen,} Hon. Sees." I can orate the stateme nt of Mr. Somers, whose letter is appended, as to the state of tho house named on the West Kent Park estate. " N"ith Road, West Kent Park, 1st December, 1863. Sir—I take the liberty of bringing under your notice, that many severe and fatal Cases of fever have occurred during the last few weeks amongst the families of the working men resident on this estate. The condition of many of the small houses is such as to render them perfect nurseries of malaria and fever; in the smallest of five-roomed cottages as many as 17 or 18 men, women, and children are living; many of these cottages are considerably below the level of the road, having no escape for the surface water; their drainage and water supply of the most imperfect description; the floors and walls reeking with moisture, and certainly totally unfit for human habitation. Mr. Treverton, your Hoard's Surveyor, has inspected some houses 1 have pointed out to him, situate in the Park Road, the property of Mr. George Browne, of Sydenham Park, and will be able to report to the Board the condition he found them in. I trust that the Board will order some inspection to be made of this district, with a view to its sanitary improvement. I remain, Sir, Your obedient servant, Jas. Somers." ' The Chairman, &c., District Board of Works, Lewisham." I have to call your attention to the Act for the Regulation of Bakehouses, limiting the hours of labour, and making regulations with respect to cleanliness and ventilation. It is most important that these regulations should, as much as possible, be carried out, both for tho sake of those employed in the manufacture and to ensure sweet and wholesome bread for the public use.

During the four weeks nt tbo same period last year I had to inform you that 65 deaths had taken place. But tho mortality this year has not exceeded the average number when taking into consideration the increase of population in the district. Nine deaths have taken place from inflammatory affection of tho lungs. Five deaths have taken place from consumption of the lungs. Thirteen from epidemic disease, viz: — 17th Dec. Smallpox, Phconix Square. ,, Scarlatina, Ravensbourno Tcrracc. 29th Nov. Scarlatina, Union Workhouse. 16th Dec. Diphtheria, Lady Well. 20th „ Fever, Lewisham. 22nd Nov.

Measles, Wells Road. 22nd „ Measles, Hanover Street. 2lst „ Measles, Russell Street. The mildness of the weather and dampness of the atmosphere have been favourable to the spread of epidemic disease. The only exception to this being typhus fever, which, as it originates from overcrowding and starvation is liable to spread more in colder weather when houses are necessarily more closed, and therefore not well ventilated, and when work is not so easily obtainable—and accordingly we find that measles is very prevalent, more especially in Sydenham ; scarlatina in a minor degree. Smallpox, though occurring in those parts of the district most crowded and less favoured by sanitary regulations, is not spreading in any alarming degree, as all available means have been taken to render the houses of those suffering from this disease, in as favourable a sanitary condition as practicable under the circumstances. Sporadic cases of fever have occurred, but this disease is not epidemic. Whilst mentioning this class of disease, I feel it my duty to state that the establishment of a small hospital (or as it used formerly to be termed " pest house"), constructed upon an elevated and open space of ground, would be of great use in this district, and would tend in the most important manner to check the progress of epidemic disease, and thus not only save life but be likely to promote the pecuniary benefit of the district. lhe small house for the reception of contagious diseases at the Union Workhouse has been of great value to the parish. An iron apartment could be constructed at a moderate expense, and could be soarranged as to be added to if increased room were required. Thus patients suffering from the more dangerous classes of epidemic disease could be at once removed from their houses and receive, in many instances, such care and attention and fresh air as they could not by possibility obtain in their own homes. 17 The only moans of saving the healthy in these cases is by isolating the sick. A house in Park End, Sydenham, occupied by Mr. Smith, Surgeon, is in a very bad sanitary condition from want of sufficient drainage, and should in common with all the houses in this locality be we11 and sufficiently drained into the sewer which has just been constructed in tho main road adjacent.

Five deaths have occurred in those beween the ages of 80 and 90; six in those between 70 and 80; twenty-one in chikhen under the age of two years. Smallpox, which was epidemic in parts of the district, has much diminished in the number of persons afFcctcd, and is, I hope, disappearing. I wo deaths have occurred 18 from this cause during the month, one of which occurred in a man aged 54 years who had never been vaccinated. Influenza and whooping cough arc still prevalent. Cases of scarlet fever have occurred, but no deaths have taken place from this cause. The epidemic of measles has affected a great number of children as well as grown-up persons, but has much diminished in severity. The road at the corner of Park End is a swamp of considerable extent, and is prejudicial to health; a gully here would remove all difficulty upon the subject.

Twenty-two of these deaths have occurred in children under two years of age. Seven deaths have taken place from inflammation of the air passages.

I have examined into these complaints, and find at Mr. Frazer's that the drains run very objectionably under the floor of the house, and that the pipes are not sufficiently cemented. There is also a want of ventilation under the floor of the house. I am informed that a cesspool exists next door at a higher level than the floors of the houses. At Mr. Collins's Tailor, near the toll gate, an offensive cesspool and privy exist, which is a nuisance and dangerous to the health of the inhabitants. It is requisite that the premises should be drained efficiently and supplied with water. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.
