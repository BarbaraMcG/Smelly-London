REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the Parish of Saint Mary Abbotts, Kensington, DURING THE YEAR 1870. by T. ORME DUDFIELD, M.D., medical officer of health. london: PRINTED BY FREDERICK BELL, STEAM PRINTER, king's road, chelsea, s.w. 1871. 72085 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE YEAR 1870. to the VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF ST. MARY ABBOTTS, KENSINGTON. Gentlemen, In the ordinary course of events there would, owing to my very recent appointment, have been no "Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health" for the year 1870 ; but the Census having just made known the exact population of the Parish, the occasion appeared to me especially suitable for a brief, and mainly statistical, review of the state of the Public Health during the past year, and during the decenniad 1861—70. Such a review, if it has no other value, will at least furnish a basis for comparison in future years. 4 The Census, then, shows the Parish to have contained on the 2nd of April, 1871, 121,100 souls, viz., 49,379 males, and 71,721 females. The population in 1861 was 70,101. The increase therefore in 10 years, was no less than 51,000, or 73 per cent., and is but very partially accounted for by the excess of births over deaths during the ten years, viz., 9341. The larger portion of the increase, therefore, viz., 41,659, was due to immigration. The increase of population of London generally during the 10 years amounted to 14.7 per cent., or in round numbers, 500,000. One tenth of the Metropolitan increase, therefore, is due to the extraordinary growth of Kensington. The population of Kensington comprised 25,966 separate families, inhabiting 15,712 houses. The acreage of the Parish beingabout 2,2oo,and5oo acres being still unbuilt upon, it follows that the density of the population is, in round figures, 71 persons per acre. One of the most remarkable facts revealed by the enumeration, is the large excess of females over males, amounting to 22,342 (equal to 45.4 per cent. of the entire male population), an excess which is in no way explained by the birth-rate, and only partially by the death-rate, of the sexes, as will shortly appear. A correct estimate of the population of any given place is the necessary foundation of its Sanitary Statistics. In Table A in the Appendix, therefore, I have prepared an estimate of the population to the middle of each year, 1861—70, based partly upon the Census Returns, and in part upon the known number of inhabited houses in the several years, it being found upon reference to the Returns for 1861 and 1871, that each inhabited house contains upon an average 7.5 persons. I believe this estimate to be as near an approximation to the actual population as can be obtained, considering that the increase of late years has been so remarkable and of such an exceptional character. But in any case, it will be understood to form the basis of the following Statistics. 5 The population in 1870, at the middle of the year, is assumed to have numbered 115,062. The births registered during the year were 3,705, viz., 1,897 males, and 1,808 females—equivalent to an annual rate of 32.20 to 1,000 persons living, 3 per 1000 less than the birth-rate of the entire Metropolis, which was 35.3 per 1,000. The deaths registered were 2,473 number, viz, 1,231 males, and 1,242 females. The annual rate of mortality therefore, was equal to 21.49 per 1,000 in Kensington (or 20.45 per 1,000, excluding the deaths of non-parishioners in the Brompton Consumption Hospital), while it was 24.31 in the West districts of London; 25.28 in the East districts, 24.12 in the Metropolis as a whole, and 221 per 1,000 in the entire Kingdom. It is worthy of note that the annual death rate of females in this Parish, was about 18 per 1,000 only, as against 25 per 1,000 of the opposite sex. The births exceeded the deaths in Kensington by 1,232 ; but the estimated increase of population during the year was 8,742, the difference being due to removals into the parish. The Parish is divided for Registration purposes into two Subdistricts of very unequal size, viz., Kensington Town and Brompton. With such a limited division, I cannot perceive that any great practical advantage would arise from treating separately, at any length, the vital statistics of these sub-districts; but I may mention, in passing, that the births in Kensington Town were 3,033, and in Brompton, 672, while the deaths in Kensington Town numbered 1,855, and in Brompton 618. Thus, while the births in Kensington Town exceeded the deaths by 1,178, the births in Brompton were only 54 more than the deaths, or 176, if from the total number of deaths those of nonparishioners in Brompton Hospital be deducted. The subjoined Table shows the quarterly number of births and deaths for the entire Parish. Births. Deaths. 1st Quarter 990 669 2nd „ 929 694 3rd „ 851 666 4th „ 935 644 Total 3,705 2,473 6 Six hundred and four children died under one year old. Under five years of age there died—including the 604 above-mentioned— 1,060 persons. The deaths over 60 years of age were 485. The percentage of deaths under one year to the births registered, was identical in Kensington and in the Metropolis generally, viz., 16.3 The percentage of deaths under 5 years to the births was in Kensington, 28.6 ; and in the Metropolis, as a whole, 29.2. The percentage of deaths at the above ages, and above 60 years of age, to the total number of deaths in Kensington, and in the Metropolis respectively, was almost indentical, viz.:— Kensington. London. Under 1 year 24.4 23.9 per cent. Under 5 years 43.0 43.0 „ Over 60 years 19.7 19.7 „ The deaths in Kensington Parish from seven principal diseases of the Zymotic class (viz., small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping-cough, fever, and diarrhœa), were more numerous, absolutely and relatively, in 1870, than in any other year to which any researches have extended (Vide Appendix Table B). These diseases were the causes of death in 545 cases—equivalent to 22.2 per cent. of the total mortality—the proportionate relation of the deaths from the same diseases, to the total deaths in London, being 21.3 per cent. The annual rates of mortality from these maladies in the Metropolis generally, was 5.1, and in Kensington 4.7, to every 1,000 persons living. It is one great aim of Sanitary science to diminish the total rate of mortality by removing the causes which give rise to these diseases, which owe their importance to the fact that they, or most of them, are infectious as well as preventible. In the Appendix, Table B, I have shown the number of deaths in each year from 1861 to 1870, inclusive, from the seven diseases above-named, and from Cholera ; and in Table D, the principal localities from which fatal cases of these maladies were registered in 1870. 7 Pulmonary diseases account for 809 deaths, or 687 deaths, excluding, as is but just, those of non parishioners, which took place in the Brompton Consumption Hospital. Thus they were the causes of death in 28.5 per cent. of all the cases registered, equal to an annual mortality of about 6 per 1000. As usual, these maladies were most fatal during the winter quarters, while diarrhoea was the ruling disease in the hot summer months. The influence of temperature is well shown in the subjoined table, which sets out the mortality from Pulmonary diseases, and from Diarrhoea, during the winter and the summer quarters respectively. Deaths from Pulmonary Diseases. Deaths from Diarrhœa. Average Temperature. 1st Quarter 267 9 38°0 2nd „ 201 33 54°6 3rd „ 128 96 60°8 4th „ 213 16 41°4 More detailed illustration of the point here dwelt upon, viz. :—influence of temperature upon the rate of mortality, will be found in the Appendix, Table C, from which it will appear that the low death rate from pulmonary diseases in summer is mainly due to the comparative absence or mildness, at that period, of Bronchial complaints, which are so prevalent and so fatal, especially to the aged, during the winter season. The deaths from all causes in the Winter quarters were 1,313, and in the Summer quarters 1,160, a difference in favor of the latter of 153. No greater mistake, indeed, can be made than to suppose " cold" in winter to be "seasonable," using the word in the sense generally intended ; viz., "healthy." Cold is very fatal at both extremes of life,—to the young and to the aged, whose deaths form so large a proportion of all deaths. A mild winter and a temperate summer husband life, and conduce to longevity. So surely as the thermometer falls to a low point in winter, the death-rate rises. The mortality in great cities is always highest in cold weather. At the period of greatest cold last year, the 8 mortality in the twenty great cities of the kingdom, was at the annual rate of 31 per 1,000, while in the genial weather of June it sank to 21 per 1,000. Three hundred and thirty deaths (13.3 per cent, of total deaths) took place in public institutions, including 1S6 (93 males and 93 females) in the Workhouse; and 142 (70 males and 72 females) in the Hospital for Consumption at Brompton. The deaths of Parishioners in the latter institution were about 20 in number. The deaths by violence numbered 41. One hundred and one Inquests were held ; the cause of death was uncertified, there having been no medical attendant, in about 20 cases. The mean temperature of the air at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, during 1870, was 48°7. The temperature was higher than the average in the spring and summer, while in the first and fourth quarters, and especially in December, the mean was below the average. The mean degree of humidity of the year was 78—three degrees below the average in 29 years—complete saturation being represented by 100. The rainfall of the year was 18.5 inches, and so much as seven inches below the average fall in 55 years. During the three months ending June, only 1.2 inches were registered, or 4.6 below the average. The most fatal, and what may be termed the ruling epidemic ot the year, was scarlet-fever, which destroyed 198 lives—equivalent to 8 per cent. of the total mortality. The deaths from this cause in the four quarters of the year were, respectively, 24, 36, 58, and 80. From our knowledge of the average fatality of Searlet-fever, we may assume 2,000 persons to have been attacked in the course of the year. It is a marked feature of this dreaded malady, that the mischief it works is not to be estimated solely by the deaths which occur during the prevalence of an epidemic. Nephria ("Bright's disease,") and other ailments more or less serious,—and which in after years appear in the returns as the proximate causes of death,—too often owe their origin to, it may be, a 9 slight and even disregarded attack of Scailet-fever, or "Scarlatina," as it is the mischievous fashion to call such cases, under the erroneous notion that there is some difference between the one and the other, if they are not different diseases altogether. It cannot be too widely known that no such difference exists; that Scarlet-fever and Scarlatina (which is merely the Latin and scientific name for Scarlet-fever) are one and the same disease; and that of all epidemic diseases, this is, perhaps, the one most to be feared. Small-pox may be more loathsome to the view, but we have great power of control over it; and, if the means we possess were only duly employed, it would no longer be a source of panic as it is at the present moment. But even under existing circumstances, and with widespread neglect of Vaccination, the fatality of Small-pox is, on an average of years, a light thing compared with that of Scarlet-fever, as will appear from the fact that while Small-pox was fatal to only 25,061 persons in the Metropolis during the last 31 years, Scarlet-fever carried off 34,358 persons in the last ten years alone. The subjoined Table shews in a striking manner the relative importance of the two diseases as causes of death, and will not have been presented in vain should it attract to the subject of Scarlet-fever the attention its vast importance deserves.

The annual rate of mortality from this cause was 1.7 per 1,000 in Kensington (1.8 per 1,000 in the Metropolis generally). At the close of the year, the malady decreased with rapidity, and the place it had so long filled in the mortality tables became occupied by Small-pox, an epidemic of which then set in—not without warning—with almost unexampled violence, and has continued with nearly unabated severity to the present time. The present report scarcely furnishes the proper occasion for any special reference to the epidemic in question; but a few words on the subject of the preventive remedy, Vaccination, may not be out of place. I regret it is not in my power to speak, in altogether favourable terms, of the state of the infant population of the Parish in respect of Vaccination. The registered births in 1870 were 3705. The successful cases of vaccination registered were only 2,341, including 32 children born out of the Parish. There were, therefore, some 1,364 cases of apparent non-compliance with the provisions of the law, a number equal to 37 per cent. of all the births. True, six hundred and four children died under one year of age; but if we assume—a most improbable assumption— that none of these were vaccinated, a very large number (760) would still remain to be accounted for. After a careful consideration of the whole question, and with considerable experience acquired during the existing epidemic, I think it may be fairly assumed that 25 per cent. of the children born in the parish last year and up to the time of the appointment of the present vaccination officer, were deprived of the benefits of Vaccination. And if this estimate is at all within the mark, we have no cause to be surprised at the prevalence of Small-pox; but, having regard to the amount of material the epidemic has had to work upon, much reason for thankfulness that our case has not been far worse! The recently published Report of the Vaccination Officer for the first half of the current year, throws some light upon the subject; and I therefore reproduce the 11 Statistical part of it. The number of cases investigated was 2,415, including 1,077 cases previously unaccounted for, and a six month's List of Births, shortly afterwards supplied to him by the Registrars under the Statute. The following is a Summary of the result of the investigation. Certificates of successful Vaccination 1,422 Vaccinate 1, but certificates not yet received 35 Had small pox 5 Insusceptible 9 Died 154 Ill 5G Emigrated or migrated 29 Unknown at address registered 19 Removed; addresses not ascertainable 508 Still unaccounted for 178 Total number of cases 2,415 Passing by the "Arrear Cases," which, I hope, will not form a prominent feature in future returns, as the whole time of the Vaccination Officer is now devoted to his important duties, it will be obvious that many of the failures to obtain proof of compliance with the Law on the part of parents, must be due to defect in the Law itself, which provides for a half-yearly return, only, of births. This difficulty has been surmounted, latterly, by a private arrangement between the Registrars and the Vaccination Officer, who now receives a Monthly List of Births.* The Bill recently introduced by the Government for amending the Vaccination Act of 1867, contains various provisions of importance intended to remedy the defects of the existing Act. The responsibility of carrying out the law is to be transferred from the Privy Council to the Poor Law Board, or, rather, to the new "Local Government Board," should the "Local Government Bill" become law.† The appointment of a Vaccination Officer is to be compulsory * I desire to acknowledge the courtesy of the Registrars (the Messrs. Barnes), and of the Vaccination Officer (Mr. Shattock), in supplying me with information upon this subject. † This Bill was passed after the Report was in type. 12 on Boards of Guardians, and the district assigned to the officer is to coincide with a registration, or a vaccination, district. The Registrar of Births and Deaths will transmit to him, once a month, a list of births, and of the deaths of children under one year of age; and the duties of Registrar of Vaccination will be transferred from the Registrar of Births, &c., to the Vaccination Officer, a plan which will enable the latter to ascertain whether every child in his district is vaccinated. One of the most questionable parts of the new Bill is that which proposes to modify the penalty-clauses of the existing Act. If a parent has been once adjudged to pay the full penalty of twenty shillings, or twice adjudged to pay a smaller penalty, no farther conviction can be obtained, and the unfortunate child, or children, must remain unvaccinated. It is to be hoped that this clause will be modified, if not altogether rejected,* otherwise much evil will arise, although, indeed, we may fairly anticipate that the number of those who are sceptical of the advantages of vaccination will constantly decrease under the influence of education. What vaccination can achieve, is shown by the results obtained in Ireland, where, under a very efficient system, and by the happy union in each member of the Dispensary Medical Staff", of the triple functions of Poor Law Medical Officer, Registrar of Births and Public Vaccinator, vaccination is all but universal; Smallpox has been well nigh exterminated ; and nearly every local outbreak may be traced to cases imported from this or some other country. A similar result might be obtained here by the adoption of like means—multiplication of Public Vaccinators, and the appointment to this office of all Poor Law Medical Officers. It may be reasonably doubted whether the present policy of the Privy Council Medical Department of restricting the number of Public Vaccinators, is calculated to have the same good effect; or whether, for example, the people of Birmingham, and of St. * The Clause was thrown out in the Upper Home of Parliament and the Bill pasted at the end of the Session. 13 Pancras, are as likely to be efficiently vaccinated, now that in each Parish there is but one public vaccinator, where formerly there were eight! Before concluding this Report, a few words will not be considered out of place on the important subject of the Water Supply of the Parish, which is dependent on three companies, viz., the "West Middlesex," the "Grand Junction," and the "Chelsea." We learn from Professor Frankland's Annual Report that the water supplied by each company was tested upon twelve occasions during the year, with a view to ascertain with what degree of perfection the important process of filtration was effected. The water of the West Middlesex Company was found clear and transparent upon every occasion. The Grand Junction Company's water was "slightly turbid" upon two occasions, while that of the Chelsea Company was upon two occasions "slightly turbid," upon two other occasions "very turbid,"—so muddy, indeed, as to be entirely unfit for domestic purposes, and clear and transparent on eight occasions. The water of the West Middlesex Company alone was perfectly filtered; but that of the Grand Junction Company exhibited marked improvement upon former years. Living organisms were found in the Chelsea water on two occasions, and in the Grand Junction water, once. The average proportion of solid impurity, and of organic matter, was considerably less, however, in 1870, than in the previous year. The companies appear to have paid considerable attention to the improvement of the water supplied by them; nevertheless, it is a general and a growing feeling, that the water supply of the Metropolis should be placed under the control of a public and independent Board—an object that can hardly fail to be realized within the next few years. The quantity of water supplied for domestic use appears to be sufficient, on an average, viz., 25 gallons per diem to every person in the Metropolis; but the means of storage in many of the crowded houses of the poor, is both bad in character, and insufficient in amount. Where, therefore, an 14 abundant supply is most needed, it is too often lacking ; and in many cases a common cistern supplies all the wants of the household, even including the service of the water-closet. A constant service, without the intervention of cisterns or other vessels, may be anticipated as one of the most welcome first-fruits incident upon the transference of the water-supply to the Metropolitan Authority. With respect to the supply of Gas by the Western Gas Light Company, many and general complaints have been made, in the course of the year, of want of light. Nevertheless, the Company's published records go to show that the average illuminating power of the gas was at all times, above the standard required by the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860. This question is now under the consideration of a Special Committee appointed to investigate it, and whose Report may be shortly expected to be laid before the Vestry. The Tables A to D, in the Appendix, contain, in a convenient form for reference, much of the Statistical information set out above. Table A contains, in addition, some important Statistical information, which it would not have been convenient to insert in the body of the Report. Table E details the Sanitary work effected, and the nuisances removed through the agency of the Inspectors (Messrs. Wood and Landman), while the Report of the Surveyor embodies all necessary particulars as to the number of houses drained, new gullies made, and of the sewers constructed, cleansed, and flushed during the year.
