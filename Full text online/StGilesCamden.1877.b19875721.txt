The Report of the Analyst under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875, is also annexed. Meetings. The following Meetings have been held during the year commencing June, 1876, and ending May, 1877:— Board Meetings 25 Finance Committee Meetings 16 Works Committee 11 Sanitary Committee 13 Special Committees on various subjects . 18 In all . 83 Annual Accounts. The Accounts of the Board for 1878 are annexed. The large payments to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the London School Board, for which precepts were made on this District, amounted as follows:— For the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate (comprising Main Drainage, Fire Brigade, Sinking Fund, and General Expenses), the sum of £6,700 0 0 The School Board for London 7,243 1 8 Making together . £13,943 1 8 And being more than one fourth of the whole of the expenditure of the Board. The following table shows the several amounts paid by this District to the Metropolitan Boa,rd of Works for the last ten years:— Amount.

The amounts paid by this district to the London School Board since it was constituted are as follow:— Year.

Notwithstanding the many remonstrances against the lavish expenditure of the School Board since the year 1873, and the extreme dissatisfaction expressed by the Ratepayers in all parts of the Metropolis, and the deputations to the Council on Education, the London School Board continue not only to pursue a like course of extravagance, but to increase it, as will be seen by the foregoing table, the rate for this District having since the year 1874 increased, in the year 1875, 68 per cent.; 1876, 116 per cent.; and 1877, 139 per cent. The remedy is to a certain extent with the Ratepayers, who, by re-electing the same members of the Board, have practically approved this enormous outlay. The Decease of a Member. The Board sincerely regret to announce the death of Mr. Samuel Hewitt, of Great Russell Street, Surveyor, a late Member of this Board. During the period he held office he was active and attentive in his duties. The Election of a Representative at the Metropolitan Board of Works. Borlase Hill Adams, Esq., J.P., of No. 51, Bedford Square, has, for the seventh time, been unanimously elected the Representative of this Board at the Metropolitan Board of Works for three years. 9 Metropolitan and Regent Circus Railway Company. A Bill to incorporate this Company was promoted in the present Session of Parliament by the Metropolitan Railway Company for the purpose of making an underground railway along the line of New Street, sanctioned by Parliament in the last Session, from Regent Circus, Piccadilly, to Old Street, St. Luke, as far as the Farringdon Street Station, by way of Tichbourne Street, King Street, Dudley Street, Hart Street, Theobald's Road, and Portpool Lane, Clerkenwell. The Board resolved to petition against the Bill in order to obtain the requisite locus standi for the insertion of clauses to protect its interests in the several streets through which the line would be made—against the powers inserted in the Bill to acquire the vaults only of certain houses in some of such streets in contravention of the Land Clauses Consolidation Acts—and to provide compensation to tenants who would sustain the entire loss of their business. Owing to some difficulties that arose, the promoters determined not to proceed with the Bill this Session, and it was withdrawn. Lascelles Place and Vinegar Yard. On the requisition of the Guardians of the Poor of these Parishes, under the Highway Acts, and the consents of the Earl of Harewood, and Viscount Lascelles (the freeholders), and of the Joint Vestry of the Parishes, the Board as the Surveyor of the highways, applied to and obtained an Order of two Justices of the County of Middlesex for shutting up the public way from Lascelles Place into and closing Vinegar Yard; the object of the Guardians being, it was stated, to enable them to erect on the site of Vinegar Yard part of a new workhouse sanctioned by the Local Government Board. This Order was in the month of February last confirmed by the Justices at the Quarter Sessions, and has since been carried into effect. Public Health Bill. Late in the last Session of Parliament, the Government brought in a Bill to consolidate and amend the law relating to the Public Health in the Metropolis. The most important feature was an attempt for the first time to give the Local Government Board powers of controlling, governing, and superseding the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis in sanitary matters, without any appeal. The Bill by its title purported to be for the amendment of the public health, but it contained no new feature save the sanitary arrangement of "Dairies." It entirely failed to deal with the subjects most important to health, as cleansing and scavengering of streets; the removal of dust and ashes; the inspection and control of common lodging houses; the water supply; and in particular to provide more stringent measures for the prevention of the spread of contagious diseases, and hospitals for such diseases; and it did not propose to improve or extend the existing laws. The Bill was opposed, and numerous 10 petitions presented against it, among such was one by this Board, enumerating the foregoing objections and deficiencies, and stating that no controlling power was necessary in the Metropolis, but suggesting that if Parliament thought it was, that the Metropolitan Board of Works would be the most fit body wherein to vest such power, by reason of it having already the control of the Public Sewers, the enforcement of the Acts relating to contagious diseases in cattle, the cow and slaughter houses and the prevention of offensive trades; and further that such Board being elected by the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis would more fairly represent the Metropolis than the Local Government Board, which is appointed solely by the Government. The opposition in the House of Commons resulted in the Bill being withdrawn. Water Supply. Early in the present Session, two Bills, called the Water Companies' Purchase Bill, and the Metropolis Water Supply Bill, were brought into Parliament by the Metropolitan Board of Works. By the first Bill it was proposed to purchase the works of the several water companies of the Metropolis, at an estimated cost of £25,000,000, the present income of which is stated to be about £1,300,000, which would not pay 4 per cent, on the capital outlay. By the other Bill it was proposed to establish a new water supply at an estimated cost of five and a-half millions. Very considerable opposition was made to these Bills in Parliament, and numerous petitions, including a petition by this Board, were presented against them, and the Government declining to consent to their being referred to a Special Committee, the same were subsequently withdrawn by the promoters. Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. GREAT WILD STREET SCHEME. The Metropolitan Board of Works, in compliance with the condition annexed to the approval of this Scheme by the Home Secretary have purchased the houses Nos. 134 to 137, Drury Lane, and are reported to be in negotiation with the owners and occupiers for the acquisition of the leasehold houses and premises, situate in Princess Street and Great Wild Street, required for carrying the same into effect. LITTLE CORAM STEEET SCHEME. The Metropolitan Board of Works have by its Committee viewed the area and buildings comprised in the Representation made under this Act by Dr. Lovett, the Medical Officer of Health, but the same is still under the consideration of the Board, and in view of the numerous other Representations of unhealthy areas in the Metropolis, made prior to this scheme, it is believed that considerable time will elapse before that Board wiil be able to deal with it. 11 Coal Yard and Goldsmith's Alley Improvement. The Board have proceeded with this Improvement (having for its object the conversion of the alley, in parts only 2 ft. 9 in. wide, into a street 20 feet wide), and have purchased and removed No. 12, Coal Yard, and the workshops adjoining in Goldsmith's Alley, but owing to delay in establishing the title to the freehold of the large shed and premises, occupying a considerable portion of the proposed new street, the improvement has not yet been completed. Street Nomenclature. The following streets have been re-named and re-numbered under the Powers of the Metropolis Management Act, 18 & 19 Vic. cap. 120:— Name. Renamed. Bloomsbcby Market Silver Street Brownlow Street Betterton Street Everett Street Mabchmont Street George Street 1 and Dtott Street New Street Princes Street Kemble Street Wilmott Street Kenton Street Chdrch Lane Bucknall Street The following streets have been renumbered:—Ashlin's Place, Chenies Street, Chenies Mews, Compton Mews, Denmark Street, Denmark Place, Dudley Street, North and South Keppel Mews, Newton Street, Woburn Street, Torrington Mews East. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. Under this Act Dr. Redwood, of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, has, with the approbation of the Local Government Board, been again appointed the Analyst for the district. There have been 311 cases of Analysis during the year. Proceedings were taken in 19 cases, and convictions obtained. The fines and costs imposed in such cases amounted to £45 3s. 6d. It is to be observed that the prosecutions, fines, and convictions are more than those of last year, owing to several cases of gin adulteration having been discovered and successfully prosecuted, including an appeal in one case to the Quarter Sessions. The Report of the Analyst forms a part of this Report, and contains much useful information on the subject. Sanitary Acts. There have been several cases of prosecution under these Acts, and in all cases Orders have been made by the magistrates for the abatement of the nuisances complained of. In some instances the Board have, under their statutory powers, entered on the premises and performed the necessary works, and recovered the costs of the same from the owners. June, 1878.

New Sewers. The following lengths of new sewers were constructed during the year: Russell Square, north side, 620ft. run of brick Sewer, 4ft. by 2ft. 6in. internal dimensions. Marchmont Street 423ft. run do. do. Great Coram Stroet 418 do. do. Total 1461 feet. Street Cleansing. The following staff of street orderlies were employed by the Board and constantly engaged during the year in cleansing the public ways of the District, viz: One foreman, three gangers, and thirty-one sweepers—total thirtyfive men. Two street sweeping machines, each drawn by one horse, were used in sweeping the paved carriage ways. The slop and dirt swept up were carted away by contract. The total quantity of street sweepings removed during the year was 10,565 loads The cost of the street cleansing for the year ending 25th March, 1878, was as follows:— £ s.d. Wages of Street Orderlies &c. 1889 5 5 Amount paid to Contractors for removal of Slop, &c. 2566 8 6 Total cost of Street Cleansing £4455 13 11 Street Washing. Power was reserved by the Board in its contracts for street watering and removal of slop, to wash the main thoroughfares of the District, when from a long continuance of dry weather they became in a very dirty condition. This washing has been performed during the year on eight occasions 24 with satisfactory results. The quantity of slop swept up and carted away after these washings was 151 double loads. The cost of watering, sweeping up, and carting away this slop is included in the above-mentioned cost of street cleansing. Street Watering. The public ways of the District were watered under contract; the contractor supplying all carts, horses, and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work per annum. The quantity of water used for this purpose (including that used for the street washing before referred to) was 4,926,000 gallons. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs of £ s. d. stand posts, &c., was 310 3 5 For hire of carts, horses, and men (by contract) 790 4 0 Total £1100 7 5 Removal of Dust and Ashes.

The entrances to the mews, yards, courts, &c., in the district were twice limewhited during the year at a cost of £60. Public Urinals. The Urinals belonging to the Board are 19 in number, and contain 47 compartments. Nine of the Urinals, containing 33 compartments, have water laid on to them, the others are without water. The whole of them are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. They were painted once during the year at a cost of about £15. Public Lighting. The works of rearrangement of the Public Lamps in the District, the substitution of lamp posts, and lanterns of the new pattern approved by the Board, for those of the old pattern, and the erection of additional lamps in those public ways, the lighting of which is defective, were proceeded with. The total number of new lamps erected up to the 25th March, 1878, was 131, of which 101 were in substitution of old lamps, and 30 were additional lamps. The cost of lighting the public ways in the District was as follows : Gas, including the lighting and extinguishing, £ s. d. cleansing and maintaining the lamps 3899 7 9 New columns, lanterns, &c. 644 6 11 Total £4543 14 8 25 Metropolitan and Regent Circus Railway. Notices were issued, and Plans and Bills deposited during the year, for the formation of a line of Railway, extending from Regent Circus, Piccadilly, to a Junction with the Metropolitan Railway, in Farringdon Road. It was proposed to be formed entirely beneath the Street surface, and to follow the line of the new Street, authorized to be formed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, from Regent Circus to Moor Street, (where it would enter the St. Giles District,) thence beneath Dudley Street, which is to be widened, to Broad Street:— from Broad Street beneath the new Street, which is to be formed, to Oxford Street, near to Duke Street; and thence beneath Hart Street to Orange Street (where it would leave the St. Giles District), and be continued beneath Theobald's Road, King's Road, Liquorpond Street, &c., to Farringdon Road. The interests of the Board and of the inhabitants of the District not being in your opinion sufficiently provided for in the Bill, your Board resolved to petition against it, which was accordingly done. The Bill passed the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, but was subsequently abandoned by the promoters. The following is a list of the Contracts entered into by the Board, and in force, up to the 25th day of March, 1878: Name and Address of Contractors. Nature of Contract. Term of Contract. Booth & Wheeler, 42, Bankside. For the supply of Granite Cubes, broken Guernsey Granite, Granite Kerb, and Yorkshire stone, as per schedule of prices. One year from 29th September, 1877.

GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report for the year ending December 31st, 1877. In order to supply a standard of comparison for the District, I shall as usual state a few facts taken from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary, relating to the Metropolis. "The area of London included within the Registrar-General's district is 78,080 acres, or 122 square miles, of which 2,718 acres is occupied by that part of the River Thames which falls within the area, so that the acreage of land is 74,362. The length of the streets is about 1,500 miles, and the area nearly 12 square miles. The length of public sewers is about 2,000 miles." "Elevation.—The population of London reside at a mean elevation of 39 feet above Trinity high-water mark; the elevation varying from 11 feet below high water mark inPlumstead marshes to 429 feet above high water-mark in Hampstead." "Houses.—At the Census in 1871 there were within this area 417,767 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7'8 persons to a house." "Annual Rateable Value—Of Property in the Metropolis, in December, 1876, as assessed by the Metropolitan Board of Works— £23,251,702." Density, 1871.—103 persons to a hectare; 42 persons to an acre; 26,674 to a square mile. "Annual Rate of Inckease of Population.—Per cent. 1851-61, 1-73; 1861-71, 1-50. "1877. "Population — Males 1,653,841 (Estimated to the middle Females 1,879,643 total 3,533,484." "BIRTHS.-(Males 65,122 total 127, 257" Females 62,135 "Annual rate of births per 1,000 of the population, 36'1." "Deaths.- {Males 39,806 Females 37,196} total 77,002." "Annual rate of mortality per 1,000. Males 24.2) Females 19.9 }total 21• 9." "Excess of registered births over deaths, 50,255." "Estimated increase of population, 43,938." "1877. "St. Giles District. "Area in acres, 245." "Density of persons to an acre (Census 1871), 219." 29 (St. George, Bloomsbury 17,843 "Population (Census 1871) (St. Giles South 19,089 (St. Giles North 16,497 Whole District 53,429" The Marriage-rate in St. Giles District. The marriages in the District, during the year 1877, are as under, for which I am indebted to the kindness of the Parochial Clergy, and the Registrar of the District. Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages. St. Giles-in-the-Fields (Parish Church, High Street) Established Church 142 St. George, Bloomsbury (Parish Church, Hart Street) Established Church 135 Superintendent Registrar's Office 39 Sardinian Chapel, Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields Roman Catholic 47 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist 5 Little Wild Street Chapel Baptist 3 Keppel Street Chapel Baptist 1 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesley an Methodist 14 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church 4 Kingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street Baptist 1 Total 391 There were, therefore, 782 persons married, which gives a marriagerate of 14'63 per 1,000. The average rate for the last three years is equal to 14G8 per 1,000. The Birth-rate in St. Giles District. During the year the Births Registered in the three Sub-Districts were as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 429 St. Giles South 805 St. Giles North 420 Entire District 1,654 of which 855 were males, and 799 females. These numbers will not give an accurate birth-rate, because 105 children born in the British Lying-in-Hospital, Endell Street, and 38 in the Workhouse, Broad Street, were children of non-parishioners belonging to other parts of the metropolis. Therefore if correction be made by deducting 143 Births from the Sub-District of St. Giles South, it reduces the actual number of Births to 1,511, and gives the Birthrate for the whole District as 28'28 per 1,000, or 1 in 3536 as the ratio of Births to population, almost identical with the preceding year, and again below the average. 30 The following tables will exhibit these facts more clearly:— Registered Births in 52 Weeks of 1877.

During the year the Deaths Registered in the three Sub-Districts were as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 252 St. Gilea South 565 St. Giles North 271 Entire District 1088 of which 559 were males, and 529 females. These numbers must be corrected by deducting the deaths of nonparishioners who died in the Workhouse, Broad Street; the British Lying-in-Hospital, Endell Street; and the Infants' Home, 35, Great Coram Street; and by adding the deaths of parishioners, who died in the several Public Hospitals and Institutions, situated out of the District. The actual number of deaths will be 1196, which gives a death-rate for the whole District of 22.38 per 1,000, or a ratio of 1 in 44.67 of population; or nearly the same as in the year 1876, it being then 23.30 per 1,000, and below the decennial average by 2.46 per 1,000. These corrections will be seen by the following tables:— 32 Registered Deaths in 52 Weeks of 1877. Sub-Districts of St. Giles. Sub-Districts. (Population, 1871.) First Quarter. 13weeka.

Deaths of Children under 1 and up to 5 years of Age. 472 children died under 5 years of age, which gives 1 death in every 3'50 registered births, and 1 death in every 230 of all registered deaths. The infantile mortality was almost the same as in the preceding year, and again below the average. Deaths of Persons 60 years and upwards. 238 persons died at 60 years and upwards, giving the following rate of mortality: 1 death in every 4.67 of all registered deaths and in every 224 of population. The Workhouse, Broad Street. Births.—115 children were born in the Workhouse, nearly onethird of whom belonged to the Strand Union. Deaths.—142 paupers died in the Workhouse, 68 in the Cleveland Street Hospital of the Central Sick Asylum, and 10 in Hampstead and Stockwell Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylum Board, making a total of 220 pauper deaths. I have to acknowledge the kindness of the various Officers of the Guardians for at all times affording me valuable information. The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. Of the 121 children born in the British Lying-in Hospital, 4 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 7 to St. Giles South, 5 to St. Giles North, whilst the remaining 105 were children of mothers previously resident in other parts of the metropolis. Only one case of twins occurred during the year. Five children were still-born. Six mothers and 7 children died during the year. The mothers died within a short period of each other from puerperal fever. The spread of this disease caused much anxiety both to the Committee and Staff. The Hospital was closed, cleansed and disinfected, which arrested the further spread of the disease, and since its reopening no fresh cases of fever have occurred. 35 The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Great Russell Street. The following table will sliow the amount of useful work performed by the Medical and Surgical Staff of the Dispensary for the benefit of the sick poor in our district. I have especially to thank Dr. Steele, the Resident Medical Officer, for his kindness in giving information respecting infectious cases which have occurred amongst the patients of the Dispensary.

I adhere to the opinion given by me in last year's Report, that all institutions for the reception and nursing of infants should be placed directly under Government supervision. Deaths not Certified. Six deaths were registered as uncertified, and an inquest ought to be held on all such cases where no medical certificate of the cause of death is forwarded to the registrar. Inquests. 97 Inquests were held, 67 of the deaths were returned from natural causes, 26 from accidental causes, and 4 were suicides. The large number of inquests in South St. Giles, is chiefly connected with the Workhouse. C 2 36 Showing the Numder of Inquests during the Year, with the Cause of Death. Cause of Death.

The total deaths from diseases of these important organs during the year were 322, viz., Bronchitis, 249; Pneumonia, 57; Pleurisy, 8; Laryngitis, 1; Asthma, 1; and other Lung Diseases (excluding Phthisis), 6. Bronchitis continues to be the principal cause, the deaths from it more than doubled those of any other disease. Pneumonia carried off 87. Both these diseases occur at the extremes of age, and the mortality is greater during the winter months, when cold winds and fogs are prevalent. 37 Tubercular Diseases. The total deaths were 167, viz., Phthisis, 121; Tubercular Meningitis, 24; Tabes Mesenterica, 12, and Scrofula, 10. As a proof that diseases of this important order are greatly influenced by hereditary and insanitary conditions, the deaths caused by them during the year, in the sub-district of St. George, Bloomsbury (which is surrounded by handsome squares, and is the wealthiest and best constructed locality in the district), were only 32, whilst the deaths from the same order of diseases in the sub-district of South St. Giles (which includes the squalid courts and alleys surrounding Great Wild Street and Drury Lane, where light, dry air, warm clothing, good food, and sobriety are conspicuous by their absence), were 91. Zymotic Diseases, The total deaths were 187. The year was characterised in the district by the prevalence of Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diarrhoea, and Typhoid Fever. Small-pox.—This disease re-appeared in the metropolis as an epidemic at the beginning of 1876, and first showed itself in St. Giles' District, in May of that year; it then disappeared from our midst until October, but from that date to the 31st of December, 18 cases occurred, of which 4 were fatal. During the whole of 1877 small-pox affected this district with variable severity, it was nowhere endemic but appeared at different periods, scattered over the entire district—nearly 100 cases were reported on, and on removal into hospital, the rooms, bedding, clothing, &c., were thoroughly disinfected for the purpose of arresting the spread of the disease. The Guardians issued hand-bills urging re-vaccination on persons above 15 years of age, but this was feebly responded to, except by the persons inhabiting houses infected by the disease. During the year 12 deaths were reported, of these only 2 (1 adult and 1 child) died in the district, the remaining 10 parishioners died at the Hampstead, Stockwell, and Highgate small-pox hospitals. From the Registrar General's return, it shows that "during the year 6728 cases of small-pox were admitted to the Metropolitan "Asylum Hospitals; 7242 completed cases were recorded, of which "1284 were deaths, and 5958 recoveries. The proportional mortality "among the 7242 completed cases in the year was equal to 17'7 per "cent.; in the first quarter of the year the mortality was equal to 19"7 "per cent., in the second quarter 164, in the third quarter 109, and in the last quarter it increased to 29'6 per cent. Of the total deaths in London from small-pox during this year in a population of 3,533,484, were 2544, or 1 in 1388. Of these 569 occurred among those persons who had been vaccinated; 1080 deaths were those who had not been vaccinated, and of the remainder, 895, no information was obtained as to vaccination. The following return kindly supplied to me by Mr. Yardley, the officer appointed by the Guardians, will give the necessary information relative to vaccination in the district. Return respecting the "Vaccination of Children whose Births werb Registered during the Year. (For the period from July 1st, 1876, to June 30th, 1877, being the latest records made up for the Local Government Board). Registration Sub-Districts comprised in Vaccination Officer's District.

Scarlet Fever.—16 deaths were recorded from this disease, against 31 and 48 for the two preceding years, and 24 less than the yearly average. Whooping-Cough—which had been extremely fatal during the previous year, caused only 12 deaths in 1877, and 30 below the average. Diarriicea.—49 persons died from this disease, 19 below the average, a lower number than has been recorded for many years past. Fever (Including Typhus, Typhoid, and Simple continued.) —There were 17 deaths from fever (all cases of Typhoid), including 1 death in Stockwell Hospital; 4 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 10 to St. Giles South, and 3 to St. Giles North. The annual average for 10 years was 26'9 Metria (Puerperal Fever).—13 women died from Ibis disease a few days after their confinements; 6 of the deaths occurred in the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street; the other 7 in various parts of the district. The deaths from the other Zymotic Diseases, viz., Diphtheria 3; Croup 4; Erysipelas 3 ; Syphilis 8; and Rheumatism 7 ; require no comment. Sanitary Work. During the year, Sanitary Inspectors O'Donnell and Walters, made more than 10,000 visits, and superintended the carrying out of the various orders of your Board for improving the sanitary conditions of houses and premises in the district; a full account of which will be found in the Appendix table, No. VI.; a large amount of sanitary work, however, in addition, such as the removal of nuisances, cleansing of premises, &c., is effected by the inspectors without any necessity for the formal order of the Board. Proceedings under the Sanitary Acts.—The several cases which were taken before the Police Magistrates by your order, related to sanitary defects of an ordinary sort and require but little notice. The Magistrates convicted the defendants with costs in every case, and ordered the necessary works to be completed within a certain specified time. Overcrowding.—Many cases of overcrowding were discovered by the sanitary inspectors, who at once served notices upon the owners of the premises to reduce the numbers, which as a rule were promptly obeyed. Underground Dwellings.—Notices were also served upon owners to close rooms occupied as underground sleeping rooms, contrary to law. 40 Dangerous Structures.—Several cases of dangerous structures were reported by the Sanitary Inspectors, and notices relative to them forwarded to the District Surveyor. Nuisances from Animals (Dog-keeping).—Complaints were made against two persons for keeping large numbers of dogs, so as to be a nuisance, or injurious to health. On inspection, I found 9 dogs in one house and 14 in another, and considered the keeping of so many animals in a confined space caused bad smells, dangerous to health. Upon statutory notices being served on the owners, these nuisances were abated. Nuisance from a Trade (Japanning).—Several complaints were made of a nuisance arising from the process of japanning, carried on in premises situated in the district. On visiting, I found the fumes to be very pungent and dangerous to health. A statutory notice was 6erved on the owner, who at once complied with the order. Slaughter Houses.—The Middlesex magistrates, at their November Petty Sessions, granted licences to the under-mentioned butchers for slaughter houses, but ordered certain works to be executed, which were considered by your Sanitary Committee, and which works were carried out under the direction of your Surveyor.

Hag and Bone Shops.—These shops are reported to be fairly ciean and regular considering the nature of the business carried on. 41 Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868 (Torrens). The owners of Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Tower Street, in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields, not having complied with the order which your Board made for certain structural alterations to the premises, the houses were closed by order of your Board, and have since been demolished by the owners. Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1875 (Cross). Representation No. 1 (Great Wild Street area).—An Act of Parliament was passed in 1877, entitled "Metropolis (Great Wild Street, &c.) Improvement Schemes Confirmation Act, 1877," which had reference to a portion of the Great Wild Street district, previously reported by me to the Metropolitan Board of Works as an unhealthy area, under the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1875, and which that Board subsequently dealt with by preparing a scheme including the following places— 1. Princes Street (north side). 2. Drury Lane (portion of east side), omitting the Houses, Nos. 134, 135, 136, 137, Drury Lane. 3. Great Wild Street (portion of west side). 4. Lincoln Court. 5. Orange Court. 6. Pitt Place. 7. Wild Passage. The number of persons of the labouring classes displaced by the scheme is set forth in the following table— Number of Holdings. Number of Rooms in each Holding. Total Number of Rooms. Average Number of Occupants in each Holding. Total Number of Occupants. 365 l 365 3.02 1104 98 2 196 3.80 371 29 3 or more. 110 4.24 123 492 Holdings. 671 Rooms. 1598 Occupants. and in addition there are 5 Registered Lodging Houses, containing 44 rooms with accommodation for 241 persons. The Home Secretary confirmed the said scheme, and authorised it to be carried into execution, subject to the following conditions and modifications:— 1. Provided the Metropolitan Board of Works amended the scheme by purchasing (but not by compulsion), within 6 calendar months from the date of the passing of the Act of Parliament, the houses Nos. 134, 135, 136, 137, Drury Lane, which houses contain 30 rooms, with accommodation for 64 occupants. 42 2. The dwellings for the working classes to be erected, shall be built in 6 blocks; one of 6 storeys, and 5 of 5 storeys, and one of such remaining blocks shall be constructed to serve as a registered Lodging House, to accommodate 240 persons. 3. Each block on every storey, according to the number and size of the buildings, to be furnished with water-closets, sinks with water supply, and dust shoots; arrangements to be made for providing standing room for trucks and store rooms for costermongers' goods ; when the buildings shall have been acquired, to be taken down and removed by sections of buildings, and new buildings erected according to regulations made by the Metropolitan Board of Works. 4. Princes Street shall be widened to 40 feet between Drury Lane and Great Wild Street. The eastern end of Great Wild Street shall be widened to 40 feet. I am happy to say that the conditions imposed by the Secretary of State have been agreed to, and I hope soon to be in a position to report that the demolition of this unhealthy and notorious portion of the district has been accomplished, and the way cleared for erecting new and healthy dwellings for the working classes of the neighbourhood. Representation No. 2 (Little Coram Street area).—The Works and General Purposes Committee of the Metropolitan Board of Works inspected the property on this area on the 4th of August last, but no scheme respecting it has yet been prepared by that Board. It is gratifying to be able to state that the health of St. Giles district continues to be satisfactory, for the death-rate is nearly the same as that of last year, and is a great encouragement to the Board to persevere in its sanitary work. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. R. LOVETT, Medical Officer of Health. June, 1878. APPENDIX.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANALYST Appointed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS OF THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— During the twelve months to which this Report refers, ending the 31st of last March, I received from your Inspector, Mr. Hoyle, 311 samples for analysis, consisting of bread, butter, tea, coffee, cocoa, milk, cheese, beer, gin, whisky, wine, vinegar, pepper, mustard, flour, corn-flour, oatmeal, arrowroot, curry powder, Cayenne-pepper, sugar, currants, sweets, preserved fish and vegetables, pickles, sauce, liquorice, and citrate of iron and quinine. The result of the analysis of these various articles has been the detection of numerous instances of adulteration, including 22 samples of milk, 1 of bread, 2 of butter, 1 of porter, 8 of gin, and 1 of mustard. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, 17, Bloomsbury Square, T. REDWOOD. 24th June, 1878.
