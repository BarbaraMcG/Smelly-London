A REPORT Of the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., for the year ending Lady- day, 1870. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Act," 1855. N.B.—The Medical Officer's and Sanitary Reports will be issued separately. REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, Having entered upon the duties of Vestry Clerk at Ladyday last—the period when the official year of the Vestry terminates— I shall be able to present you with but little information from my own resources, but I have requested the officers in each of the departments to make a report upon the proceedings of the Vestry in connection with those departments. As the business of the Vestry is chiefly to raise money, to expend the same upon necessary works, and to secure the proper sanitary condition of the inhabitants, the reports, therefore, of the Accountant, the Surveyor, Medical Officer, and Sanitary Inspectors will present a complete epitome of the progress of the Vestry for the period which those reports will embrace. LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. I may, however, mention that, during the last year some important changes have been effected by the Legislature in Parochial administration. The great difficulties raised by the abolition of the system of compounding, effected by the "Representation of the People Act,' have been removed by the passing of the "Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act, 1869," by which owners may again compound for rates, and may also be compulsorily rated and rendered liable, and by which occupiers of houses let for less periods than three months may deduct the rates paid by them from the rent. This Act is now in full operation. A. large number of owners have compounded, and take the deduction of 30 per cent. Some have been rated and are allowed 15 per cent., and the clause enabling tenants of short holdings to deduct the rates from the rent is beginning to work satisfactorily. The magistrates, as a rule, decline to excuse the rates of occupiers of this class of property, as such relief would be rather to the owner than the occupier. At the last petty session there was a marked 6 diminution in the number of appeals by weekly and monthly tenants. The Accountant informs me that he is not yet in a position to present a comparison of the loss by allowance of the owners commission under the present, and the loss under the former system consequent upon the inability of the small occupiers, but in a short time we shall be able to present accurate statistics upon that point. I would, however, take this opportunity to observe, that the allowance of 30 per cent. to owners is in excess of that given by any other parish within my knowledge. It is 5 per cent. more than is given in Bethnal Green, and 10 per cent. in excess of the Mile End scale; and considering that after Lady-day next, when the new Valuation List will come into operation, property under £20 rental will be entitled to a deduction of one-fourth, to arrive at the rateable value, while property between £20 and £40 will be entitled to a deduction of one-fifth, and rentals above £40 to one-sixth only, it might be desirable to consider whether equity does not require that scale of allowance to be varied. As six months' notice must be given to rescind the resolution now in force, Michaelmas would be a convenient time to give such notices; and if the Vestry so determined, the new scale of allowance and new scale of rating would commence simultaneously. Another important change effected by the legislation of last year is in respect to the assessment of the rateable property in the parish. The object of this Act is to ensure a uniform system of rating over the entire metropolis, with a view to the further equitable adjustment of charges to bo borne by metropolitan ratepayers. The working out of this Act belongs more to the present year than the past, and there is nothing to report to Lady-day of any action taken except that the return papers provided by the Inland Revenue department have been issued, and many of them have been returned to the Vestry to be dealt with in the preparation of the Valuation list. I may, however, for the information of the public, state that in this parish the scale of deduction from the gross rental to the rateable value has been on a uniform basis of one third. This was not only unjust but was entirely opposed to the rocognized principles of rating. This will in future be corrected by the now Valuation Act, which fixes the maximum scale of deductions as follows:— 7 THIRD SCHEDULE of the VALUATION ACT, 1869. Showing the several classes into which the hereditaments inserted in a valuation list under this Act are to be divided. Maximum rate of deductions. Per cent. or proportion. Class 1.—Houses and buildings, or either of them, without land or other than gardens where the gross value is under £20 25 or ¼th „ 2.—Houses and buildings without land other than gardens and pleasure grounds valued therewith for the purpose of inhabited house duty where the gross value is £20 and under £40 20 or 1/5th „ 3.—Houses and buildings without land other than gardens and pleasure grounds valued therewith for the purpose of inhabited house duty where the gross value is £40 or upwards 162/3 or 1/6th „ 4.—Buildings without land which are not liable to inhabited house duty and are of a gross value of £20 and under £40 20 or 1/5th „ 5.—Buildings without land which are not liable to inhabited house duty and are of a gross value of £40 or upwards 162/3 or 1/6th „ 6.—Land with buildings not houses 10 or 1/10th ,, 7.—Land without buildings 5 or 1/20th „ 8.—Mills and manufactories 33⅓ or ⅓rd „ 9.—Tithes, tithe commutation rent-charge, and other ments in lieu of tithe „ 10.—Railways, canals, docks, tolls, waterworks, and gasworks „ 11.—Rateable hereditaments not included in any of the going classes To be determined in each case according to the circumstances and the general purposes of law. The maximum rate of deductions prescribed in this schedule shall not apply to houses or buildings let out in separate tenements, but the rate of deductions in such cases shall be determined as in Classes 9, 10, and 11. The effect of this scale will be to considerably increase the rateable value of the parish. As regards the internal parochial charges, this alteration will not materially affect the ratepayers, as no more money will have to be raised, nor externally—that is, in respect to metropolitan and other charges, inasmuch, as they have hitherto been levied on the basis of the County rate, which has been considerably above the parochial rateable value; and it is probable that no additional burden will fall upon the parish. But this is a matter rather for speculation than for report, which supposes to deal with the affairs of the past. By next Lady-day the entire system throughout the metropolis ought to be in full operation, and a uniform and equitable mode of assessment established. The Great Eastern Railway Company have introduced a bill into Parliament (since passed) to defer the period for the completion of the extension from Shoreditch to Liverpool Street and other works to three 8 years from the passing of the Act; to alter the level of the extension from the high to the low, or in other words, to construct it below instead of above ground ; and in this bill a clause has been introduced requiring the Great Eastern Company to construct a footway between the termini of the Great Eastern and North London Railways, eight feet wide, from Sun Street to Liverpool Street. This is the subject of agreement between the two companies, and is intended to obviate the necessity of making a new entrance to the North London Station, as required by that Company's Act, and to meet the convenience of persons living north of those stations. A bill has been introduced (since passed) authorising the construction of a tramway through the City Road, which, for the length of about 800 yards, will pass through this parish. The Education bill has passed into law, but it confers no new powers on the Vestry, although in respect to elections for members of the School Board some duties may be imposed upon the Churchwardens. Mr. C. Buxton, M.P., introduced a series of bills into Parliament, the object of which was to remodel the government of the metropolis, which would have involved the abolition of the Vestries and the establishment of municipal councils in the Parliamentary boroughs. One of these bills passed the second reading, and was referred to a select Committee. The other bills were not read a second time, and the Committee was not appointed. It is anticipated that early legislation upon the subject will take place at the instance of the Government. IMPROVEMENTS. An improvement of considerable magnitude has been carried out in the parish of Shoreditch by the Metropolitan Board, the first of any character in this parish to which any contribution has been made by that Board. Shepherdess Walk has been widened by setting back the wall of St. Luke's Workhouse some 40 feet, thus opening up the way for carriage traffic through to the Essex Road, Islington. Although almost tho whole of the land taken for improvement is situate within the parish of Shoreditch, the advantages to accrue will fall equally, if not in a greater proportion to Islington and St. Luke's. But the parish of 9 Shoreditch lent its aid willingly for the promotion of the desired object. Some difficulties have arisen respecting the purchase of a small portion of ground belonging to the Trustees of Lady Lumley's Almshouses, or to the Trustees of the Bishopsgate Charities, which have prevented the completion of the work, but which it is hoped will speedily be surmounted. The street is now in a fair way for opening, and will be as soon as negociations between the Vestry and the Metropolitan Board respecting the paving of the foot and carriageways are completed, and the works carried out. THE TOWN HALL. During the year ending Lady-day, the public hall has been occupied for lectures, meetings, concerts, and other entertainments 156 times, and the council chamber 15 times, the receipts for which amounted to £637 1s. 2d. It might be questioned whether the resources of the hall are as sufficiently developed as they might be, and the full encouragement is given to so convenient a place of assembly as it merits. But this I leave to the judgment of the Vestry and its Committee. LAW PROCEEDINGS. The law proceedings of the Vestry during the past year, so far as I am aware, have been limited. A disputed claim for rent for a portion of an estate in the City Road, for land occupied by the City Road, and the subject of an alleged agreement between the late Commissioners of Turnpike Roads and the owners of the estate in question was decided in favor of the claimants; but as no costs were given, it is clear that the Court were of opinion that it was a proper question to be raised. A long appeal has been pending between the London and North Western Railway and the Parish in respect to the Goods Station at Broad Street. As points of law were raised, the parties agreed to submit a special case to the Court of Queen's Bench, but the special case could not be agreed upon, and the actions of the Company's Agent were so unsatisfactory, that the Vestry at length resolved to abide by the ordinary remedy, and by the appeal at the Quarter Sessions. Steps have been taken with this object, and it is to be hoped that the matter in dispute may be speedily settled, as the amount claimed by the parish for rates, &c., unpaid, amounts to thousands of pounds. 10 In concluding this report I feel bound to acknowledge the very excellent condition in which I found the work of this department on my entering. There were no arrears or confusion, and my best thanks are due to my predecessor, Mr. W. G Davis, for the very satisfactory manner in which he handed over to me his office, and for the valuable assistance he has rendered to me since I entered upon it. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Clerk's Offices— Town Hall, St. Leonard, Shoreditch. June 12th, 1870. 11 REPORT OF THE ACCOUNTANT. Gentlemen, In submitting to the Vestry a brief report of the Financial position of the Parish, with a copy statement of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Vestry, in respect to the execution of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," during the year ending on the 25th day of March last, as approved and certified by the auditors, I would beg to draw attention to the noticeable fact of a decrease in the expenditure in the vestry account of £4,470 14s. 9d., as compared with the previous year; the amount for the year 1869 being £55,515 13s. 9d., and for the year ending 1870, £51,044 19s. 0d.; likewise to a reduction of the rates in arrear at the same period, there being due on the 25th March, 1869, £49,102 1s. 8d., and the 25th March, 1870, £45,027 7s. 11½d., shewing a reduction of £4074 13 8½d., in which lesser amount is included, the sum of £7,572 18s. 4d., due from the London and North Western Railway Company, at present pending an appeal. It will be further seen that the gross Parochial Receipts and Expenditure from all sources were as follows:—receipts from the Poor Rate £73,029 7s. 9d.; against an expenditure of £73,169 10s. 2d. (in which is included an overdrawn balance due to the Treasurer of £10,983 0s. 8d.), leaving a balance due to the Treasurer of £70 2s. 5d.; the Vestry Account shews receipts, £59,908 2s. 3d., with an expenditure of £51,044 19s., and a balance in favour of the Parish of £8,863 3s. 3d. The rateable value of the parish has also increased £1,263, being at Lady-day, 1869, £388,794 as compared with £390,057 at Lady-day, 1870. The further classified statements appended, to which I beg to refer, give a clear and comprehensive view of the monetary position and transactions of the Vestry.

COLE, Accountant to the Vestry. 17 REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR. Gentlemen, I beg most respectfully to submit to you the Annual Report of work carried out under my superintendance, for the year ending 25th March, 1870, viz:— Watering the Roads, Streets, &c. The whole of the parish was watered from the 1st March to the 31st October, 1869, by Mr. William Clilverd, of Acorn Wharf, Great Cambridge Street, (under a contract), for the sum of £905 (who for neglect of duty was fined £13). The hydrants (seventeen), have been kept in repair during the period for watering at a cost of £2 9s. 0d., and in preparation for the ensuing season, have been altered and fitted with swan's necks at a cost of £32 13s. Od. The quantity of water consumed was 10,085,000 gallons, and the amounts paid the Water Companies as follows:— New River Company. 7,303,000 gallons at 1/- per 1,000 gallons . £365 3 0 Discount 19 3 5 345 19 7 Rent of 12 meters at 42/- each 25 4 0 £371 3 7 East London Water Company. 2,782,000 gallons at 9d. per 1,000 gallons . £104 6 6 Rent of 5 meters at 42/- each 10 10 0 £114 16 6 Making the total cost of watering for the season £1380 9s. 1d. 18 Cleansing and Dusting, &c. The whole of the parish has been cleansed, the dust removed, and the gullies emptied (under contracts), from 25th March to 24th June, 1869, by Mr. Charles T. Parsons, of Shad well Dock Wharf, Lower Shad well. for the sura of £995 ; and from the 24th June, 1869, to the 25th March, 1870, by Mr. William Winn, of Gloucester Street, Curtain Road, for the sum of £2625, making a total of £3620. During the first quarter of the year the work was executed by Mr. Parsons very satisfactorily, but I regret to say that during the last few months of the period for which Mr. Winn held the contract, complaints have been very numerous, both as to scavenging and dusting. The number of gullies is as follows : East Division 984 West Division 1088 2072 By order of the Vestry four summonses were taken out at Worship Street Police Court against persons in the employ of the contractor for scavenging (Mr. Winn), for sweeping mud down the gullies; the first two cases the magistrate discharged with a caution, but the other two were fined—one ten shillings, and the other five shillings and costs. Maintenance of Roads, Streets, &c. The cost and quantity of materials used for the repair of the Mc Adam and Ballast Roads during the year is as follows:— 2061 yards cube broken Granite, at 12/6 yard £1288 2 6 78 ,, ,, Ballast, at 3/9 yard 14 12 6 £1302 15 0 The number of laborers employed in repairing and spreading the materials on the roads, streets, &c., is ten; and the wages paid them and two foremen (one for the East and one for the West divisions), amounted to £677 8s. 9d. for the year. 19 The amount paid by the different Gas and Water Campanies, for repairing over trenches in the McAdamized and Ballast roads and footways in the parish, was £168 6s. 11d. for the year. The extent of the roads, streets, &c., in the parish, and kept in repair by the Vestry, is about fifty miles— Macadamized and Ballast 41 miles Paved with Granite Cubes 9 ,, Carriageway Paving (New Works.) The following new works have been executed during the year amounting in the aggregate to £13,416 17s. 10d., as follows:— New North Road—the whole of the carriageway within the parish paved with new 3 by 7 Mount Sorrel pitchings (under a special contract) at a cost of £8,381 15s. 7d.

Footway Paving (Repairs).

Lee Street (North side)—The footway relaid at a cost of £27 6s. 9d. There are two masons with a laborer each, employed in repairing the footway pavements in the parish, one of them is generally employed in repairing trenches, opened by the Gas and Water Companies, and their wages amounted to £245 1s. 8d. for the year. The amount of work done for the Gas and Water Companies, in repairing trenches in the footways, was £244 19s. 2d. The contractors supplied 2,100 feet super of new 25½-inch York, at a cost of £52 10s. 0d., which was used in the repair of the footway pavements in the parish. 22 There has been one man generally employed in the stone yard (Flemming Street) in dressing old stone, and his wages amounted to £79 1s. 3d. for the year; the quantity and description of stone dressed is as follows:— 580 yards 6 feet super Granites. 602 feet 6 inches super Moorstone And 1076 feet run edge curb. Sewers Work. The only works performed by the contractor during the year were a new gully constructed in Glo'ster place, Hackney road, at a cost of £3 2s. 9d. (Bethnal Green contributing one moiety), and the 12-inch pipe sewer in Queen square, Hoxton street, reconstructed for a length of 260 feet at a cost of £11 3s. 8d. There are three men constantly employed in flushing the sewers in the parish, also a laborer generally employed on sewers work, and their wages amounted to £278 3s. 10d. for the year. There is also one man employed in cleansing the seventeen urinals belonging to the Vestry, and his wages during the year amounted to £52 12s. 6d. The number of public lamps in the parish on the 25th March, 1870, was— Lighted by the Independent Gas Company 1110 Lighted by the Chartered Gas Company 71 1181 The total cost of lighting the parish for the year was £4562 7s. 9d. Seventeen public urinals are maintained within the parish, and the cost of water for cleansing was £11 12s. 6d. for the year. As regards the general condition of the parish, I beg to state that the carriageway paving is in very tolerable order, being to a large extent 23 composed of new work, but there are portions which very shortly must be relaid and partly provided with new stone, such as— High Street, Shoreditch. Old Street Road (from Kingsland Road to Hoxton Street.) And Pitfield Street. The footways are not so satisfactory, the wear and tear in many streets being very considerable, the repairs have been slight, and it will be necessary before long to expend a considerable amount in repaving. The most economical course would be to repave those in the main thoroughfares with new stone, using such of the old material as is fit for places of lesser importance. The condition of the Sewerage is good, the sewers being comparatively free from deposit, and there are but few places without drainage. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. C. PERRETT, Surveyor.
