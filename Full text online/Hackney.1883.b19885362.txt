LONDON: A. T. Roberts, Son & Co., Printers, 5, Hackney Road, E. 1 884. REPORT FOR THE YEAR, 1883. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, Sanitary work has been more actively carried out in the District during this than in any other year since 1866. In the first place, owing to the outbreak of Cholera in Egypt and the consequent apprehension of its spread to this country, it was deemed advisable temporarily to increase the staff; secondly, because of the examination of a large number of houses not ordinarily inspected, to ascertain whether or not there was a proper water.supply and apparatus to the closets; and thirdly, owing to the circulars of the Local Government Board, it was necessary that I, in company with an inspector, should again carefully inspect all the courts and other places in which it was likely we should find houses in such a state as to come under the provisions of the "Artizans Dwellings Acts." Amongst the places, visited were Abney Gardens, which consists of 31 houses, of which the majority were clean and well kept, but there were six houses in so dilapidated a state that as the rooms were low, the back yards very small, and the privy accommodation bad, the owners preferred turning the houses into workshops rather than doing the works necessary to put them into a good sanitary condition. The same may be said of the two double houses in Jolly Butcher's Yard. In Stapleton's Buildings I found several houses occupied by persons who paid no rent, and as the premises were quite unfit for habitation, I communicated with the owner, who immediately took steps for ejecting the tenants, and pulling down the property. In Mason's Court I found the ventilation and light of 4 houses much interfered with by fowl.houses and other outbuildings; the paving bad, and the means of drainage imperfect. The rooms 4 in some of these houses are very low, but as only one family occupies each house, and the houses were much improved by the works done, I did not consider it to be my duty to report these as uninhabitable dwellings. As regards Nos. 11 to 25, Triangle Cottages, Morning Lane (odd numbers only), I found them n a dirty and somewhat dilapidated state, requiring considerable structural alterations. After communicating with and seeing the owner, he directed the improvements I required to be carried out, which has now been done in a satisfactory manner. There was much more difficulty as regards Fox's Cottages, in Morning Lane and in Albion Road, as they were low; many of them damp ; the roofs bad; and the walls and ceilings dirty. As each was occupied by one family only, and the owner decided on repairing them, and as the inhabitants were generally in good health, I concluded for the present that I am not required to report them under the Artizans Dwellings Acts. Some houses in High Street, Homerton, Nos. 25, 27, 29 & 31, were not only in a dirty and dilapidated state, and the attics very low and badly ventilated, so that I should have reported them as being unfit for habitation if the owners had not closed the attics, and done some repairs to the other parts of the houses. If these houses should not be pulled down shortly, I shall have to take further action. In Plough Lane there were some houses in a bad state, but as they did not come within the provisions of these Acts they were dealt with under the Nuisances Removal Acts. The same may be said of Pickles Buildings and Tryon's Court, and I have now to report that all these houses are in a much better sanitary condition than when I visited them in 1883. Two of the most difficult places in which to arrive at a decision are John's Place, Well Street, and Jerusalem Gardens. In both of these the houses are small and the rooms low, but as regards the latter, as there has not been any deaths so far as I know from zymotic diseases for some years, and as the annual death.rate for the last four years has been rather lower than amongst persons in a similar position of life in other parts of 5 this distriot, and as the owner has carried out all my ordinary sanitary requirements, I do not consider it necessary to report against these houses. As to John's Place I agreed to let the matter stand over until Spring, especially as the Board have decided to apportion the Place and have it paved, which would remove one source of the dusty and somewhat damp state of these houses. Some of the top rooms have sloping roofs, and are consequently low ; and as they have no fire.places, and the other rooms are for the most part low, I am in doubt what action to take. As there is, with one or two exceptions, in all the — houses only one family in each, and as they are let at 3s. 6d. a week for the smaller houses, and 4s. 6d. for the others, and especially as I could not ascertain from my inquiries that disease and death were unusually prevalent therein, I feel that I am justified in allowing the matter to stand over for the present. I cannot say that I consider the houses in all respects suitable for dwellings, but as there was no over.crowding, and the occupants would otherwise have to live in Model Dwellings or other houses, where they could afford to occupy only one room instead of two or three, I shall give much more consideration than I have yet done to this block of buildings before I report them under these Acts. Amongst the places which have been much improved by the action I have taken, in addition to those mentioned, are York Buildings, Stoke Newington Road, and Falcon Court and Place, where the paving and drainage have been much improved, the houses repaired and cleaned, and generally put into a better sanitary condition than they were previously. I inspected also some houses in Blackshaw Place, without finding much to complain of. In Caroline Cottages there was not any water. supply to the closets, the paving was bad and some of the houses dirty. In Conduit Place and Cottages, although the rooms were low and the paving imperfect, yet the houses were in fair condition, and the inhabitants looked well and healthy. Hammond's Cottages, Upper Dockside, were in fair order, 6 but the pathway in front was filthy and in bad repair. At Hammond's Dock the chief sanitary defect in the houses was the damp—some of the houses were in a dirty and dilapidated state, but after enquiring as to the health of the inmates I did not feel myself justified in doing more than requiring the existing nuisances to be abated. In Wilman Grove there are houses with large low back rooms, which are badly lighted and ventilated, which the owner has promised to alter, both as regards heighth and ventilation. The worst houses in the District are Elizabeth Cottages, Ridley Road, the leases of which have just terminated. If they are not speedily pulled down it will be necessary to try to obtain an order from a Magistrate, under the Nuisances Removal Acts, to have very extensive sanitary improvements made, or else to have them shut up. I desire here to express a very strong opinion that it is most unfair to the ratepayers that they should be compelled to pay for uninhabitable property which has been allowed by the owners to get into a dilapidated state for want of substantial repairs such as cannot be required under the Nuisances Removal Acts. I may say as a whole that the inspections have been fairly satisfactory, especially as a great deal of work has been done by the owners without any notice whatever being served. This was done in consequence of letters having been sent requesting them to call on me, and hear my views on the matter, and subsequently, in many instances, by meeting them at the property and pointing out what would satisfy mo. Of course the alterations have not converted old houses into new, but as there was only one family in most, and as the alternative was to drive the inhabitants elsewhere and thus cause increased overcrowding, I deemed it better that they should continue to dwell in these houses, especially as most had lived in them for many years. The dwellings occupied by the lowest class of poor are not very numerous in this District, and are not wrecked to the extent that some are in the centre of London, but clean and 7 paratively comfortable houses are speedily rendered so dirty, and the sanitary arrangements so often injured, as to make them almost unfit for human habitation. I have not as a rule found in this District that the landlords are so much to blame as the tenants, and in very few instances have the dilapidated dwellings belonged to members of the Vestry or Board; and when they did, there was no difficulty in getting the necessary repairs done. The inspections this year has been extended to a considerable number of the better class of houses to see that the water. supply to and apparatus for closets were satisfactory, and also to ascertain if there were any direct communications of the sink and bath.wastes and wash.house traps with the drains. Many of these were found to be in a very unsatisfactory state, but as the present system of supervising the drainage arrangements of the new houses is fairly satisfactory, there is no necessity for the examination of newly built houses by the Sanitary Inspector, except on complaint. There is one point of considerable importance as regards the drainage of old houses, I allude to the continuance of brick drains under or near to houses. I am strongly of opinion that no brick drains, unless laid in a thick layer of concrete, should be allowed either under or near houses, as however good and sound they may be at the present time, there is always a risk of there becoming imperfect and rats making their way through them, and thus causing injury to health before the defects become known. During the year there has been a very large number of drains choked, either from having been originally badly constructed, or from cloths or other things having found their way into them. Most of these were combined drains, and much inconvenience and some injury to health has arisen in connection with this last.named class of drains, as there is often great difficulty in obtaining their cleansing or reconstruction when the houses belong to different owners. Although there is some risk attending the laying of drains under houses, even when 8 laid in concrete, yet the rarity with which single drains when properly made and laid get choked, and the ease and speed with which the Sanitary Officers can deal with them when choked or defective, render in my opinion separate drainage of houses preferable to block drainage, at any rate in more than pairs of houses. The use of improved traps in the yards, and the disconnection of the sink and bath wastes from the drains, and, when this cannot be done, the introduction of traps between the baths or sink.wastes and the drains, which has been of late years so extensively carried out by the Sanitary Staff, will however, undoubtedly tend to prevent the ingress of materials likely to choke the drains. As however the chief inlet for cloths, dusters, scrubbing brushes and like things is the water.closet, these causes of choked drains will be kept out only to a comparatively small extent. A circular letter having been received from the Local Government Board, requesting information as to the extent to which the Regulations made for this District, under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, had been carried out. I was requested by the Sanitary Committee, to whom the matter was referred by the Board, to draw up a report on the subject. In accordance with this resolution I presented the following report to them, which was laid before the Board, and a copy sent to the President of the Local Government Board:— " Soon after the Sanitary Act was passed application was made by the Sanitary Committee of this Board requesting that power should be given to them to frame draft Regulations under the Act. On the 15th September, 1866, a copy of these Regulations was forwarded to the Secretary of State, the Right Honorable J. H. Walpole, and confirmed by him, and as soon as possible put into action. As a first step towards this, two Sub.Inspectors were appointed to measure the dwelling. rooms in all the houses occupied by the poorer classes, and to enter the measurements in books kept at the Town Hall for that purpose. The rooms in 4,600 houses were measured before 9 they ceased their work, and from time to time additional houses of this class have been measured, so that 5,014 are now entered in the books. This is a great advantage, as whenever any question of overcrowding of these houses occurs, it is only necessary to turn to the book and find the number of persons who can legally occupy any one of these rooms. The inspection of these houses was general, and all Sanitary arrangements deemed at that time to be objectionable were altered, and notices for whitewashing and cleansing the houses were also served when necessary. Since that time there has been a systematic inspection of the houses in the district occupied by the poor, partly under the powers vested in the Board by the 20th section of the Sanitary Act, and partly under the Regulations. The results of the inspections carried out in 1866 and 1867 were not separately tabulated, so that I cannot lay before you the precise amount of work done under the Regulations in these years, but I submit a list of houses inspected and of nuisances abated in these houses and the adjacent yards and outbuildings since 1867, which I consider to be very satisfactory— Houses Inspected. nces Removed In the year 1868 5857 2317 „ „ 1869 5903 2470 „ „ 1870 6193 2423 „ „ 1871 6124 2419 „ „ 1872 6126 2507 „ „ 1873 6301 2804 „ „ 1874 6049 2128 „ „ 1875 6037 2993 „ „ 1876 6103 3016 „ „ 1877 6191 3141 „ „ 1878 5571 2197 „ „ 1879 6025 2344 „ „ 1880 6197 2168 „ „ 1881 4996 3968 „ „ 1882 4227 3034 10 "The number of houses inspected in 1881.82 and 83 was less than in former years in consequence of the great attention paid to the means of drainage by cutting off the sink.wastes from the drains, removing bell traps and substituting yard. gullies, in procuring better paving and drainage of the yards, removing brick drains wherever defective, and generally in obtaining a larger amount of structural works than had been required up to that time. In 1883 a considerable number of these houses had a water.supply provided for the closets in consequence of notices served upon the owners. "Soon after the measurements were completed notices were served upon most of the owners of these houses, giving information as to the number of persons who might legally occupy each room in the houses, together with a copy of the Regulations. The name of the owner was entered in the books, but has not been altered since the first service, as it is found that there is no difficulty in obtaining the names and addresses of the owners during the annual inspection, when his name and that of the occupier is entered in the inspection books, so that we always have their names up to the latest date. "I cannot give you the number of notices served under the Regulations in 1866.68; but in 1869 I find in that year there were 1,146 served; in 1870, 1,296; in 1871, 752: 1872, 106; in 1873, 68; in 1874, 210; in 1875, 196; in 1876, 121; in 1877, 216; in 1878, 163; in 1879, 118; in 1880, 130; in 1881, only 31; in 1882, 26; making a total of 4,579 notices served since 1868, under Regulations in the years 1869.82. "There is no doubt that the Regulations have proved of great use in this District; indeed the number of notices served under them do not represent anything like their value, as where owners of property have proved troublesome the service of a copy of the Regulations and a Notice to do the works necessary to abate the nuisances existing on the premises have sufficed when ordinary notices have not been attended to. The 11 Regulations in force in this District require great alterations and additions, as they were amongst the first framed in London, and also because the number of cubic feet for air space is in excess, I believe, of that required in any other Metropolitan Parish or District. I do not think it advisable that what is overcrowding in one District should not be overcrowding in another. The time at which an inspector or other officer of the Board can visit the houses should, I think, be the same all over London, and should certainly include the power of entry up to 9 o'clock at night to ascertain if the rooms are overcrowded ; but this power must be very carefully used. I may say that I attribute our very low death.rate partly to the regular and systematic annual inspection of the poorer houses in the District. " In conclusion, I would mention that the Society of Medical Officers of Health have framed a code of Regulations for the guidance of the Members of the Society which I think well worthy of the consideration of the Committee, should they agree with me that the Regulations now in force in this District should be amended." "Signed JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., " January, 1884. Medical Officer of Health." A reply was received from the Local Government Board, acknowledging the receipt of the Report and pointing out the necessity for fresh regulations being made, in consequence of the increase of power conferred upon this Board by the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874. The matter was referred back to the Sanitary Committee to consider if new regulations are necessary, and if so, to prepare them and submit a copy to the Board.* * The new Regulations were made at a Board Meeting held on May 14th, and forwarded to the President of the Local Government Board for confirmation. 12 The total number of houses inspected during the year was extremely large in consequence of the additional assistance already referred to, which was given to the Sanitary department. The question as to the steps necessary to he taken in view of the probability of an outbreak of Cholera was referred by you to the Sanitary Committee, who engaged a sub.inspector for several months to visit the houses in which it was considered likely that there was not any water.supply to the closets. Also to ascertain if the sink.wastes were cut off from the drains or not, if there were bell.traps instead of proper traps in the yard, areas, wash.houses, and sinks. This work had been progressing for two years, but in consequence of the inadequacy of the staff to do more than the ordinary work of inspection, it had been carried out very slowly. A man was also engaged to assist the dust.inspector in visiting the smaller houses to ascertain if there were accumulations of dust thereon, and in this way the dust.inspector was able, on three days in the week, to assist in the general inspection, but did not serve notices. Under these arrangements as many as 7,538 houses were inspected, when a large number were found to be wanting in some sanitary requirements, whilst in very many cases more than one defect was found. The number of houses to which an improved water.supply or water.supply apparatus was given was very large, as water was laid on to the closets in 1,111 houses, and in many others notices were served, but the work was not completed at the end of the year, and the final results will be reported in my report for 1884. There were also as many as 524 houses in which flushing boxes were introduced, because the cisterns flushed the closets as well as the domestic supply. This is, I am sorry to say, by no means an uncommon arrangement, which I trust will soon be a thing of the past. The powers possessed by this Board to remedy this very objectionable arrangement are neither large nor certain, but the "Water Companies have full power to alter it. In 25 instances the water.supply was drawn from 13 a butt, and for all these cisterns were substituted. It was also found that the water.supply apparatus to the closets was defective in 131 houses; a comparatively small number, considering that above 7,000 houses were inspected. In addition, 314 screw.down taps, with a length of leaden pipe, were provided by the owners of houses where there was a constant supply, to enable their tenants to procure water direct from the chief supply.pipe of the house. This is a great advantage, as uncontaminated water can, in this way, always be obtained. I may say that I adopted this plan in my house many years ago, and have a draw.tap on each floor, which is a very great convenience. The total number of houses for which an improved supply of water was given and the apparatus repaired was no less than 2,182. There are of course some disadvantages of having the water laid on to water.closets in the houses of the poor, as compared with the old plan of flushing by means of a pailful of water, in consequence of the insufficient flush often given, especially by children ; also from the wires and other parts of flushing.boxes getting broken or out of order. For instance, in several cases, as the occupiers were ignorant of the means of adjusting the ball.cock so as to prevent the water from flowing over continually, they knocked the pipe together or managed to fix the ball so as to stop the supply altogether. On the other hand, pail.flushing is often omitted, and is always more or less intermittent, especially where there are two or more families in a house, so that on the whole it is far better for the water to be laid on the closets even in the dwellings of the poor. As before mentioned, attention has been given for some time past to the removal of the insufficient and dangerous bell. traps ; the cutting off of sink.wastes, and of rain.water pipes from the house.drains where they were placed near to windows. During the year as many as 2,648 premises were provided with yard gully.traps, and as sometimes two, three or more bell.traps were removed in one house, there must have been more than 14 3,000 yard gullies substituted for bell.traps. There were also 1,665 sink and bath wastes out off from direct communication with the house drains, generally by carrying them over a yard. gully, or when this could not be done, by placing a P or S trap between the sink and the drain. In addition to these, 364 choked drains were released, repaired, or relaid; 267 choked water.closets released; 181 yards were provided with improved means of drainage; and in 496 houses the stack. (rain.water) pipes were cut off from the drains, making a total of 5,625 improvements effected in the means of house.drainage in this District. I append a few cases in which the drainage arrangements were improved. In one house, nearly every one who slept in the first.floor back room suffered at intervals from sore throat, malaise, headaches, or other slight ailments. On examination, the hopper.head of a stack.pipe was found within 3 inches of the window.sill, and the stack.pipe was connected with the shoulder of the soil.pipe from a water.closet, so that when the window was open the stack.pipe ventilated into the bed.room. The stack.pipe was ordered to be carried above the roof, so as to ventilate the soil.pipe and drains. Another pipe was provided to carry off the rain.water, and the sink.waste disconnected from the drain. Instances such as these, but not always so flagrant, are rather frequently met with in the older houses of this District. A complaint was received from the owner of a large house, that although he had had the drains examined, and where necessary reconstructed, the bad smells which he had noticed in the house still continued. On making a careful examination, a rat's run was discovered passing under the foundations from the next house. On opening there it was found that a water.closet had been removed from the interior to the exterior of the house, and that the drain had not been removed or properly stopped up, so that the rats got out of the old drain, and made their way into the pantry next door. Somewhat similar cases of neglect were met with in the Lordship 15 and Shore Roads. At a large house in the Green Lanes, were offensive smells occurred and illness of a low type prevailed, it was found that the hath, wash.hand basin, and sink.wastes were conneoted directly with the house.drains, and the hopper. head of a rain.water pipe communicating with the drains was within 1 foot of a bed.room window. The whole of these were disconnected from the drains, and no illness has occurred in this or other houses in which similar works were done, viz., in Brook Road and Manor Road. In another house, a brick closet connection, made good with plaster of Paris, was found; and also a stack.pipe, running into the drain and opening within a few inches of a bed.room window. In addition to the 5,625 defects or deficiencies in the means of drainage, there were 1,949 premises improved in other ways, viz.—582 by repair or relaying of the paving of the yards, 562 by repair of old or the provision of new dust bins, 791 by cleansing, whitewashing or repairing the houses, and 14 by better ventilation. There were also 455 houses disinfected, 15 cases of overorowding abated, 13 premises from which pigs were removed, 97 accumulations of dung removed, 87 filthy places cleansed, and 481 other nuisances abated. The number of notices served to obtain the abatement of these nuisances was 9,319, and the number of summonses taken out 47. There were also 1,445 requests to remove dust attended to, and 3,074 articles removed from infected rooms, and disinfected at the Board's disinfecting chamber. The total number of houses visited under the "Nuisances, Removal, Sanitary, and Metropolis Local Management Aots" was 7,993, or nearly one.third of all the dwellings in the District; and in addition to these 1,124 on complaint, as well as 101 cow.sheds, 45 slaughter houses, 120 greengrocers' yards, 72 fishmongers' yards, 130 bake.houses, 12 houses for measuring them under the Regulations, 97 urinals, and 3 tripe or gut dressers, reaching the large total of 9,713 premises inspected during the year. There were also several work.Rooms inspected in which there were too many work.people 16 employed, and notices were served on the employers to abate the overcrowding. In one room a wash.hand basin with the waste connected with the house drain was met with, and in another there was a drain under the floor. Both these nuisances as well as the overcrowding were abated. The examination of the bake.houses was far more satisfactory than I anticipated, no flagrant instance of sanitary deficiencies having been found. Several of the greengrocers' and fishmongers' yards were dirty, and the occupiers received notice to prevent any accumulations of refuse or of dirty fish.baskets, &c., on the premises for the future. The cowsheds and many of the slaughter houses were inspected during the year, and it was necessary to oppose several occupiers of cowsheds and of one slaughter house. The latter because it was proposed to use it as a quasi public slaughter house, the former occupier, a butcher, having left, and the present occupier wishing to let it for other persons to use. After fully considering the application for renewal, and the opposition made by me, the Magistrates refused to grant the license. The cowsheds were in a fairly good state, there being but little to complain of, except in two cases, where the paving was very bad. The whole of the occupiers, except two, limewhited, cleansed, and where necessary repaired the sheds before the first licensing day, and these two completed everything to the satisfaction of the Yiew Committee and myself before the adjourned licensing day, so that the applications for a renewal of all the licenses were granted. The only trade nuisance with which I have specially dealt during the year was a Fish.skin Curer in Cheshire Yard, Homerton. After several visits and the service of a notice he left the District. There has been a rather considerable number of offensive accumulations of various kinds removed during the year, but as the number of houses in the District increase, the facilities of getting rid of refuse beoomes less, and consequently refuse and other matters are deposited in private yards, and in public places to a rather considerable extent. 17 TABLE I.

For the first time I am enabled to present an accurate return of the number and causes of deaths of Parishioners belonging to this District. Hitherto I have added on all the Deaths in the German Hospital and other Public Institutions in the District, including, also, all the drowning cases, which (as we have the River Lea and the Regent's Canal within our boundaries) I considered to be a fair compensation for the deaths of Parishioners in public institutions outside our limits. In consequence, however, of the arrangement made with a gentlemen at Somerset House, with the consent of the Registrar.General, I have obtained the names, addresses, ages and causes of deaths of all those who have died during the year in the Metropolitan Hospitals, and find that I have slightly over.compensated for these deaths. As, however, they will not 18 make a difference equal to about 0.l death per 1000 inhabitants,no alteration is necessary in past calculations. The total number of deaths for the year was 3,545 against 3,505 in the preceding year, which considering the extraordinary healthiness of 1882 is very satisfactory. The number of births is 6,502, being an increase of 79 above the number in 1882, and fairly corroborates the estimated increase in our population, which I calculate to have been 201,000 persons on the first day of July, 1883. As our numbers increase, so the number of persons to an area becomes larger every year, and is now as great as 51.1 to each aere. Indeed it is really much denser, as we have no less than 568 acres of water and open spaces out of a total of 3,935 acres. As the density of population forms a material element in the mortality of a district, it is very satisfactory to find that our total deaths are not larger. The number of births to 1000 population this year was only 32.3 against 32.9 for last year, 33.9 in 1881 and 33.2 in 1871, so that it is possible that our population is not quite so large as it has been estimated to be. The number of houses on the rate books, however, supports the calculation pretty fairly. TABLE II. Births in the Sub.Districts of Hackney, 1882. Quarters. Stoke Newington Stamford Hill. West Hackney.

In Stamford Hill Sub. Distriot there were 357 births registered against 347 in 1882 ; in "West Hackney 1,300 against 1,258 in 1882, in Hackney 2,667 against 2,609 in 1882, and in South Hackney 1,401 against 1,426 in 1882, being a small decrease. The percentages of births in the Sub.Districts correspond pretty closely with those of the populations in 1881, Stoke Newington and West Hackney being siightly in defect, whilst the other Sub.Districts were slightly in excess.

The total deaths in Stamford Hill Sub.District was 176 against 175 in 1882, in West Hackney 659 against 625, in Hackney 1,646 against 1,698 and in South Hackney 695 against 628. These numbers do not afford quite correct indications of the comparative mortality for each Sub.District, as this year the deaths in hospitals outside our District has been assigned to the Sub.District to which they belong, instead of being lumped in the Hackney Sub.District as deaths in the German Hospital. Hence we find that the number of deaths in Hackney Sub.District is returned as 52 less than 20 in 1882. I have not attempted to calculate the death.rate for each of these Sub.Districts, as the deaths in the Workhouse and the Small.pox and Fever Hospitals are registered in the Hackney District, and the varying number of population in the different Sub.Districts is so great, owing to new buildings being constructed in some and not in others, that no satisfactory results would be arrived at. The Collectors' divisions and the Wards of the Parish of Hackney do not agree with the Sub.registration Districts, and no check, therefore, in the calculations can be obtained from the rate books.

This was owing to the great dimunition in the mortality from small.pox, searlet fever, whooping cough and diarhœa. As there was so great a decrease in the number of zymotic deaths, the proportional numbers from other diseases were necessarily larger than usual. Thus, constitutional diseases, chiefly cancer and consumption, oaused 759 deaths or 21.5, against 688 or 196 per cent in 1882. Local Diseases, i.e., those which afflict certain organs, as the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, &c., caused 1,674 deaths, or 472 per cent, in 1883 against 1,657 in 1882, whilst the number of deaths assigned to developmental diseases were 472 or 13.2 per cent., against 378 or 10"8 per cent, in 1882. This group of diseases includes premature birth, atrophy and debility, and old age. The number of deaths from violence was less than usual, having been 78 or 2.2 per cent, of the whole against 100 or 2.9 in 1882. The number of deaths under 1 year was somewhat greater than in 1882, having been 816 or 23.0 per cent, against 768 or or 21.9. This is not a large excess, and was owing to the increased number of deaths registered from convulsions and premature births, but the mortality between 1 and 5 years of age was less than usual, as only 586 deaths were registered at this age period against 683 in 1882, giving with those at under 1 year, 39.5 per cent, of deaths under 5 years against 41.4 per cent, in 1882. This is satisfactory, as an excessive mortality under 5 years, as a rule, indicates something wrong in the sanitary arrangements, unless the proportions of deaths at this age arises from the temporary prevalence of some particidar disease. At the age period of 5 to 15 years there were 160 deaths or 4.5 per cent, of the total; at 15 to 25 years there were 163 deaths or 4.6 per oent.; at 25 to 35 years there were 222 deaths or 6.3 per cent.; at 35 to 45 years there were 274 deaths or 7.7 per cent.; at 45 to 55 years there 295 deaths or 8.3 per cent.; at 55 to 65 years there were 326 deaths or 9.2 per cent.; and at 65 to 75 years there were 376 deaths or 10.6 per cent., being the largest number during any 10 years of life. Between 22 75 and 85 there were as many as 267 deaths or 7.6 per cent., and 60 or 17 per cent, above 85 years of ago. As before stated, under 5 years of age there were 39.5 per cent, of the total deaths; between 5 and 35 years only 15 4 per cent., between 35 and 65 25.2 per cent., and above 65 years 19.9 per cent. Taking the ages above 80 there were 21 at 80.81 years, 27 at 81.82 years, 19 at 82.82 years, as many as 26 at 83.84 years, 11 at 84.85 years; 13 at 85.86 years; 5 at 86.87 years, 4 at 87.88 years, 11 at 88.89 years, 7 at 89.90 years, 5 at 90.91 4 at 91.92 years, 1 at 92.93 years, 2 at 95.96 years, 1 at 96.97 years, and 1 just under 100 years of age.

Includes Infantile Hydrocephalus, Meningitis, Convulsions and Teething. 5. Includes Marasmus, Atrophy and Debility, want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth. It may be noticed that the deaths from zymotic do not correspond in number with those in the former table, the reason being that those in Order 1, which are mostly infectious diseases, are alone included in this table. The number was 23 531 against 661 in 1882, or 2.63 per 1,000 population against 3 39 in 1882, which is decidedly satisfactory, as the number was much smaller in the latter year than in 1881. The deaths from tubercular affections include phthisis, scrofula, rickets, tabes mesenterica (sometimes called consumption of the bowels) and deaths caused by hydrocephalus or water on the brain in children more than 1 year old. The proportion of deaths to 1,000 population was 3 31 from inflammatory diseases of the lungs; from convulsive diseases of infants under 1 year, 0.78 per 1,000 population; and from wasting diseases of infants, 1.19 per 1,000 population. The percentages of deaths, from zymotic diseases to deaths from all oauses, was 15.0; from tubercular diseases also, 15.0 ; from inflammatory diseases of the lungs, 18.8 per cent.; from convulsive and wasting diseases of infants, 11 .17 per cent., which was above the average.

There were 19 deaths from smallpox against an average for 10 years for 77 ; 117 from measles against 58 ; 66 from scarlet fever against 82 ; 43 from diphtheria against 25 ; 56 from whooping cough against 105 ; 46 from fever against 53 ; and 104 from diarrhoea against 123, so that with the exceptions of measles and diphtheria the mortality from these diseases was below the average of the preceding 10 years. It is certainly satisfactory to note the decrease in the mortality from small.pox and fever as in 1881 and 1882. The number of deaths from fever was above the average, and in 1881 from small.pox it was much in excess. The mean annual number of deaths in 1873.82, per 10,000 population, was as follows :—From small.pox, 5.0 ; from measles, 3.7; from scarlet fever, 5.0 ; from diphtheria, 16; from whooping cough, 6.4; from fever, 33; from diarrhoea, 7.9. In 1883 the ratios were much smaller, viz., only 0.94 from small.pox; 5.82 from measles ; 3.28 from scarlet fever; 2.14 from diphtheria; 2.78 from whooping cough; 2.28 from fever, and 25 5.12 from diarrhoea, making a total of 22.4 deaths from all these diseases against an average of 32.9 for the preceding 10 years. The death.rate from these diseases for all London was 27.0 per 10,000 population against 22.4 for Hackney, which is a greater difference than usual, the average for the 10 years being 329 for Hackney and 35.3 for all London.

Thus, the average number of births in the 10 years, 1841-50, was 1,398, whilst in 1883 it was the largest recorded, viz. : 6,502. The mean number of deaths in 1841-50 was 948, in 1883, 3,545 ; the ratio of births to deaths in 1841-50 was 148, and 183 in 1883. This difference in the ratios of births to deaths arises from the much greater number of married women in Hackney now, and the much smaller proportion of servants at present living in Hackney as compared with the number in 1841-50. The number of births to each 100 deaths was the same as for 1882, and is in excess of the mean for 1871-80, when it was 177. The death-rate per 1000 population from the 7 chief zymotic diseases in 1883 was the smallest I have ever recorded, as it was only 2.24 against an average of 3.40 in 1871-80, 3.78 in 1861-70, and 3.56 in 1851-60. The nearest approach to it occurred in 1879, when the rate was 2.29, and in 1874 when it was 2.76 per 1,000 living in Hackney. As the whole of the deaths from these diseases in Hospitals are recorded, this is very satisfactory. The ratio for all London was also unusually small, viz.: 2.70 per 1,000 population. The number of deaths under 1 year to the total births registered during the year was also very low, having been 125 against 146 for all London. In the 10 years, 1871-80, the mean number for Hackney was 142 ; in 1861-70, 143, and in 1851-60, 128. Considering the large proportion of poor now residing in the District, and the greatly increased density of population, this low death-rate of infants is very satisfactory. Indeed, I do not know a better test of the sanitary conditions of a District, other things being equal, than a low death-rate of infants. The annual death-rate from all causes, 17.6 per 1,000 population, was equally satisfactory, especially as the tables now include all the deaths of residents of Hackney that occur in Hospitals outside the District. This is the lowest death-rate recorded in the District 27 since my appointment in 1856. In all London it was 20.4, or nearly 3 per 1,000 above that for Hackney, so that we still keep our position as regards healthiness, not only relatively as compared with the Metropolis as a whole, but absolutely as compared with the returns in former years. There have been several rather unusual cases of small-pox in the District during the year. I do not mean unusual as regards their course, but as to their cause. One occurred in the Boys' Refuge at Urswick Road, a little more than a quarter of a mile from the Small-pox Hospital, at a time when there was no other case near. The lad had not been out of the School and grounds for two months before the attack, nor had there been any boy brought in for more than a fortnight before, except one, and he came from a locality not infected with the disease. Another case was that of a cripple who had not been out for some months, who also lived about a quarter of a mile from the Hospital, and who had not received any visitors for some time, except his mother and sister. A similar case happened at a Refuge for young women, but as washing was taken in there it is possible that the infection might have been conveyed by the linen or blankets. Enquiries were made as to the source of infection in every case, but a satisfactory answer was rarely obtained. The proportion of children under 10 was not so large as in previous years, showing that efficient vaccination has not lost its protective power. It must not be supposed that even effective vaccination in infancy is a protection against the disease, any more than one attack of small-pox is absolutely protection against a second. So far is this from being the case, I had two fatal cases in former years, under my own treatment, which occurred in persons who were deeply pitted from small-pox. The protective power of vaccination is not greater than that of a prior attack of the disease, but as small-pox is so fatal in unprotected persons, and comparatively so mild in protected, it is surely little better than an infatuation for persons to refuse protection at so cheap a rate as that afforded by vaccination and re-vaccination. 28 An outbreak of small-pox occurred in the Haokney Union Infirmary that is so suggestive of the protective power of vaccination and re-vaccination, that I propose giving an account of it at some length. The history of the outbreak is as follows:—A man, M. J, whom we will call No. 1, was admitted into the Infirmary on March 20th, when he was suffering with symptons of secondary syphilis, viz., sore throat, loaded tongue, and pains in his bones, with some fever. On March 23rd and 24th a rash appeared, without any decided increase of temperature, which was believed to be syphilitic, especially as there was not any of the peculiar shotty feel of small-pox rash. On the 27th the vesicles became slightly pitted, when there was no longer any doubt as to the nature of the disease. He was immediately removed to the Homerton Small-pox Hospital. Daring the illness his clothes were sent away to be washed with the others, but as soon as the disease was recognized the beds and bedding were taken away to the Disinfecting Chamber, but I could not ascertain whether or not everything was sent away. Probably not, for reasons to be presently mentioned. On March 26th, G. D. (who I will call No. 2) was admitted into this Ward for some slight illness, and being much better, took bis discharge on Match 30th, and returned home to a small cottage at Lea Bridge. There was no small-pox in the neighbourhood, and had not been for some time; but he was attacked with the disease and removed to the Hospital on April 9th, and as the room was immediately disinfected by the officers of the Board of Works, and the bed and bedding were taken away and disinfected, no fresh cases occurred in this locality. On April 8th, F. H. (No. 3) had the rash of smallpox upon him, having been ailing for a day or two, and 29 was removed the same day to the Hospital; and on April 9th, J. G. (No. 4) and F. A. (No. 5) both in the samo ward as No. 1, were removed to the Small-pox Hospital; and on the same day E. C. (No. 6) sleeping in a female ward, who was engaged in the laundry, was attacked with the disease, and at once removed to the Hospital. As I understand, none of these had been re-vaccinated; but the whole of the inmates of this ward, which was in no way connected with the ward in which the disease broke out, were re-vaccinated as quiokly as possible. On April 14th and 15th two other cases, those of A. A. (Nos. 7 and 8), occupying a third ward, were attacked; the former, No. 7, was employed in the laundry, and No. 8 occupied a bed immediately opposite to No. 7, but as she was sickly she was not employed in the laundry. The inmates of this ward, as well as of the other two, were all re-vaccinated, and everything they had used properly disinfected; and subsequently both wards were emptied of their inmates—that is to say, after 15 days had elapsed from the occurrence of the last case, and no other persons have been attacked. The history of this outbreak is, I think, unusually instructive. It will be seen that No. 1 must have received the infection before his admission, as four or five days after he came in he had the rash of small-pox, which was mistaken as it readily may be, for that of syphilis. The man, No. 2, who waited upon him, being frightened on hearing what the disease was, left the Infirmary, but became infected as well as others from No. 1, and was removed to the Hospital 10 days after he left the Infirmary, and 15 days after he was first exposed to infection. If it be allowed, which I am not certain about, that small-pox is not infectious until the appearance of the rash, at any rate there can be no doubt as to the cause of his infection, nor of Nos. 3, 4 and 5, who were removed to the Hospital from the same ward on April 30 8th and 9th, A question arises in these cases, would these four cases have occurred if they had been re-vaccinated on March 25, as soon as the rash appeared in No. 1? According to Mr. Marson's opinion they would not, as he believes if re-vaccination be effectually performed within two, or at the most three days after exposure to small-pox infection, those who are so exposed will not suffer from the disease. At any rate, it is certain that no one else suffered as soon as re-vaccination was performed on all the inmates. The cause of the outbreak in the women's ward is not so simple, as there was no direct communication between the two sides of the Infirmary, the only persons passing from one to the other being the medical officers. The fact, however, that No. 6, the first case that occurred on the female side, was employed in the laundry to which the infected clothes had been sent without dis-infection (as small-pox was not suspected), and that she sickened about the usual time after the clothes were sent to the laundry, seems satisfactory evidence as to the origin of the disease. No. 1 first showed the rash about Maroh 24th, and was removed with the rash out on April 9th. This, I think, pretty conclusively proves the assumption that she took the disease from infected clothing. No. 7, who had no connection with No. 6, except that both were employed in the laundry, was removed to the Hospital on April 14, and No. 8 on April 15th, both of these being inmates of the same ward. How No. 8 caught the disease cannot be be explained, unless the clothes of No. 7 became infected in the laundry ; but, if so, it is somewhat difficult to say why the outbreak in this ward was confined to these two, unless the speedy re-vaccination of all the oocupants of the ward prevented any further spread of the disease. I think, considering the large number of inmates, I believe more than 800, the rapidity with which the epidemic was stamped out is, in my opinion, most satisfactory, especially as 31 regards the effioacy of re-vaccination, because it should be kept in mind that although three of the cases occurred in two crowded wards, no other inmates contracted the disease, although, judging from the large number of successful revaccinations, many must have been susceptible to the disease. The list of articles disinfected during the year was smaller than in any of the six years mentioned, except in 1882, as might Articles Disinfected for the Years 1878 to 1883. Years. Beds. Mattrasses.

It must not, however, be supposed that the disinfection of houses and articles of bedding is done only in fatal cases, on the contrary, it is done in every case that comes to our knowledge, either under the supervision of the medical attendant, or by the officers appointed by the Board for that purpose. The number of loads of dust removed during the year is in excess when compared with former years, partly owing to the increase in the number of inhabited houses and partly to the diminished price of coals. The excess of loads amounted to nearly 1,000 ; and there was also an increase in the sum paid for collection. The number of complaints of non-removal of 32 dust was small, and the requests to remove it, which came chiefly from persons who never will put a "D" in their windows, amounted to 1,445. The number of bodies deposited in the Mortuary was only 52 against 82 in the previous year. Several of the bodies were removed from rooms in which the living must have remained with the dead if there had not been any Mortuary to which the dead could have been removed. The plans for a new Mortuary have been in abeyance in consequence of the negociations for a new road to Homerton, near the Tramway Company's Stables having failed for the present, and the access to the proposed site being most readily obtainable by this road. The mode of access to, and the internal arrangements of the present Mortuary have been much improved, so that the necessity for a new building is not so urgent as it was in the early part of last year. Still, the present Mortuary does not afford sufficient accommodation for the wants of the Parish in times of an outbreak of infectious diseases. As most of those who die in the Asylums Board hospitals are now buried from the hospital where they die instead of being taken home, the strain on the resources of the Mortuary has been somewhat lessened. I have attended every meeting of the Board during the year, and 49 meetings of the Sanitary and other Committees, viz.: 31 of Sanitary Committee, 11 of View Committee, 6 of the Mortuary Committee, and 1 of the General Purposes Committee. The weather in January and February, 1883, was unusually warm, so that the mortality from diseases of the lungs was smaller than usual during those months, whilst in March, from the 6th to the end, it was very cold, with frequent falls of snow against rain in Jauuary and February. The mean temperature of January was nearly 3.0 deg. and of February 31 deg. above the mean of the previous 42 years, whilst for March it was as much as 5.7 deg. below the mean of the same period. The mean temperature at Greenwich was lower in March than in 33 any year since 1845. There have been only three colder months of March in the present century, viz., in 1845 (just mentioned) when the mean temperature was only 35 2 deg. against 36.1 in 1883 ; 35.8 deg. in 1837 and 35.1 deg. in 1814, the year of the great frost. The effect upon the public health of London of this unusual cold was to raise the death.rate from 21 .0 during the week ending March 3rd to 21 .7 in that ending March 30th, and for the four succeeding weeks as follows: 24.5, 24.9, 28.3, and then 25.6 per 1,000 population for the first week in April. The deaths from inflammatory diseases of the lungs were, in the week ending March 10th, 336; and in the four succeeding weeks, 464, 537, 567, and 533. As usual, Hackney suffered in about the same proportion, as it always does, at any rate, at the commencement of a period of unusual cold. In April there was a great deal of ungenial weather, rain and snow on some days with cold nights, the mean temperature being 0.3 deg. below the average of 42 years. The early part of May was cold, after which a spell of warm pleasant weather occurred, the mean temperature being in excess of the average by about half a degree, whilst that for June was a very little (0.1 deg.) above it. July was fine in the early part of the month but unsettled and cold, especially towards the latter end, so that the mean was 2.3 deg. below the average, whilst August was as a whole deoidedly pleasant, with an excess of mean temperature amounting to 0.6 deg. September was also warm and fine, except at the early part of the month, although the mean temperature was 0.3 deg. below the average of 42 years. October was a variable month, some days being very fine, but the early part and middle were unusually cold: the mean temperarure was about half a degree above the average. During the first half of November the weather was colder than usual, but in consequence of the comparative warmth from the 16th to the end of the month there was an excess of 0.3 deg. In December there was a good deal of fog or mist, with very variable weather in the early part, and unusual warmth at the latter 34 end of the month. The mean was 0.6 deg. above the average ; on some days the mean temperature was more than 10 deg. below whilst on other days it was more than 7 deg. in excess of the average. The temperatures just given are those for Greenwich, as it would not be fair to compare the observations taken here with those at Greenwich for past years. I now give a table of the results of observations taken by me in the Richmond Road. Absolute Temperature. Mean of all Highest. Mean of all Lowest. Rain in Inches. Highest. Lowest.

It is also worthy of note that the highest temperature in January, March and December was precisely the same, viz., 55.4 deg. The lowest temperature was by no means low, 23.4 deg., and occurred in March, which is also unusual, so that the highest and lowest temperatures for the year happened within 3 months of one another. This is by no means unusual in the last half of the year, but is in the first. The means of all the highest temperatures occurred as usual in August and was equal to 73.1 deg. June coming next. The means of all the lowest 35 was in March, when the very low mean of 32.7 deg. occurred, so that taking the average of the lowest for each night it was only 0.7 above freezing point. The largest rainfall happened in September and the lowest in August. The second largest occurred in February, so that if the weather had been cold, there would have been an unusually large quantity of snow. The heaviest rainfall in any one day was 0.70 inch, which occurred in September. The total rainfall at 7.ft. 6.in. above ground. line was 2085 inches. In conclusion, I have to express my satisfaction at the manner in which the whole of the Sanitary Staff have carried out their duties, which have been unusually onerous, during the present year. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN W. TRIPE,, M.D., Medical Officer of Health for the Hackney District. April 9th, 1884.
