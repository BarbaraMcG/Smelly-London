B.A., M.B., B.C., D.P.H., Cantab., Fellow of the Royal Institute of Public Health, Member of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. BARNET, N. : E. Cowing & Son, " Press " Office. To the Members of the Southgate Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1913. The Report of the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. J. W. H. Brown, is appended, and which, as usual, constitutes an excellent record of good and useful sanitary work done by him and his assistants during the year, and to whom my thanks arc due for valuable assistance in compiling this Report. I should also like to tender my thanks to the Health and Hospital Committee fcr their unfailing courtesy and support throughout the year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, A. SIDNEY RANSOME. March, 1914. 5 DESCRIPTION AND TOPOGRAPHY OF THE DISTRICT. THE Urban District of Southgate is formed by a number of hamlets, previously—and some of them even now—called "villages." It is partly situated on what is sometimes called the Northern Heights, about eight miles from London, and is rapidly becoming essentially suburban in character. The District comprises an area of 3,597 acres, and may be said to consist of three valleys, running from west to east, the northern areas being somewhat higher than the southern, and the whole consisting of very undulating ground dipping off to a rather flat area on the eastern boundary, adjoining the Edmonton district. The highest Ordnance level is on the Enfield Road, and is 302 feet; whilst the lowest is near the south-eastern boundary, and is 61 feet. The subsoil consists of various clays with large pockets of gravel and sand. On the south side is a bed of brick earth overlying a deep bed of gravel, which forms excellent building land, on which a building estate has recently been opened. Beneath these strata are beds of London clay, black sand, and chalk, more or less water-bearing, and from which the deep wells and borings of the Metropolitan Water Board derive their supply. The District may be roughly divided into four localities: (1) Soutligate, (2) Winchmore Hill, (3) a large part of New Southgate and Bounds Green, and (4) Palmers Green and a large part of Bowes; hitherto more or less distinct localities but which, by continually and rapidly growing and extending, are gradually overlapping and becoming merged one into the other, more especially the two latter. The District is now, however, more conveniently dealt with in the two county divisions of North and South Southgate, the dividing line of which passes from the Edmonton 6 boundary in Hedge Lane, along Hedge Lane, and up Bourne Hill to Chase Side Corner, Southgate. This is a more or less natural boundary line, with the major part of Southgate and Winchmore Hill, the more rural parts of the District, on the north side of the line, and Palmers Green, Bowes Park, and New Southgate, the more urban parts of the District, on the south side. For the purposes of local administration the District was in 1906 divided into four wards, which correspond roughly with the four localities above-mentioned, two wards in North Southgate and two in South Southgate. POPULATION. The census returns of 1911 showed that in this District the number of inhabitants to each occupied house averaged 4'4. Taking this as the basis of calculation, the population at Midsummer, 1913, was 37,400, an increase of 1,650 over that of the previous year. This increase is chiefly accounted for by the number of new houses occupied during the year, of which there were 135 in North Southgate and 233 in South Southgate. The natural increase of the population by excess of births over deaths was 389, as against 451 in the previous year. The population of North Southgate was 10,900, and that of South Southgate was 26,500. BIRTHS—BIRTH-RATE. During the year 695 births were registered, to which must be added 6 transferred from other Districts, making a nett total of 701 births to be accredited to this District, a decrease of 45 on the preceding year. 7 This gives a birth-rate of 18.7 per 1,000 of the population, a decrease of 2T per 1,000 on the rate of the preceding year, and the lowest rate on record. The average rate for the previous 10 years was 21.6. The birth-rate for North Southgate was 17.0, and that for South Southgate was 19.2. The birth-rate for England and Wales was 23.9, which is 0.1 above the rate in 1912, but lower than the rate in any other year on record Compared with the average of the previous 10 years the birth-rate in 1913 showed a decrease of 2.4 per 1,000. MORTALITY. General Mortality and Death-rate.—The number of deaths which occurred in the District during last year was 304. To these must be added the deaths of 61 "residents" who died in Institutions outside the district—13 in Edmonton Union; 7 in Napsbury Asylum; 6 in the Passmore Edwards Hospital, Wood Green, 13 in various London Hospitals, and 22 else where; whilst the deaths of 59 "non-residents," 55 of whom died in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospital at Winchmore Hill, must be subtracted, leaving a nett total of 306 deaths belonging to the District. The crude or recorded death-rate was therefore 81 per 1,000 of the population. In order to obtain the corrected deathrate for the purposes of accurately comparing the death-rate with that of other Districts, it is necessary, in addition to the above corrections, to take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population. The "factor for correction" for this District is now 1.0288. The corrected rate is obtained by multiplying the crude or recorded death-rate by this factor. 8 The corrected death-rate was 8.3 per 1,000, the same as the rate of the preceding year, and 0.4 below the average rate for the previous ten years. As compared with the previous year, the most noticeable feature was the 5 deaths from Whooping Cough, the result of an epidemic of this disease during the early part of the year. The death-rate for England and Wales was 13.7 per 1,000, which was 0.4 above the rate in 1912. Compared with the average rate of the previous 10 years, the death-rate in 1913 showed a decrease of T2 per 1,000. Infantile Mortality.—There were 43 deaths of infants under 1 year of age, which gives an infantile death-rate of 61 per 1,000 births registered, as against 67 in the preceding year, 89 in 1911, and 50 in 1910. The average rate for the 10 years 1903-1912 was 71. In Table V. are set forth the causes of deaths of infants under one year of age, in weeks and months. The infantile death-rate of North Southgate was 91, and that of South Southgate 51. The infantile death-rate in England and Wales was 109 which is 14 per 1,000 above the rate in 1912. Senile Mortality.—Among persons of 70 years of age and over, 57 deaths occurred, and, of these, 19 were 80 years of age and over. This is a proportion of 18 per cent. of the total number of deaths at all ages, as against 25 per cent. in the preceding year. The percentage of deaths of persons of 70 years of age and over in North Southgate was 22, and in South Southgate 16. 9 Zymotic Mortality.—This includes the deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:—Smallpox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhosa. The rate affords useful evidence as to the general healthiness of the District, and as to the efficiency of its sanitary administration. There were 12 deaths from these diseases, as follows:—Diphtheria, 2; Scarlet Fever, 1; Enteric Fever, 1; Whooping Cough, 5; and Diarrhosa, 3. The Zymotic death-rate was therefore 0.32 per 1,000 of the population, as against .27 in the preceding year, .82 in 1911, and .34; in 1910. The average rate for the 10 years, 1903 to 1912, was .74. The rate for North Southgate was .55, and that for South Southgate .22. The Public Mortuary.—During the year 11 bodies were deposited in the Mortuary, as against 13 in the preceding year and 18 in 1911. 10 Inquests held during the Year 1913 on deaths occurring in the District.

It will be seen from Table II. that 218 cases of infectious diseases were notified during the year, as compared with 261 in the preceding year, 115 in 1911, and 119 in 1910. Of these 94 were Scarlet Fever, 21 Diphtheria, 22 Erysipelas, 4 Enteric Fever, 2 Acute Poliomyelitis, 1 Measles, and 74 Phthisis. Of these, 67 were notified from North Southgate, and 151 from South Southgate. These 218 cases represent infection in 193 houses, all of which were subsequently disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. In all cases disinfectants were supplied, instructions given as to the carrying out of isolation as efficiently as possible in cases of non-removal to the hospital, and the sanitary condition of the premises inspected. In 35 houses sanitary defects were found, consisting chiefly of defective water-closets and defective yard pavings. These defects have all been remedied under the supervision of the Sanitary Authority. The notification of these diseases was, therefore, the means of causing the inspection, apart from the ordinary inspections, of 193 premises, and the remedy of insanitary conditions in 35. Eighty-nine cases were removed to the Isolation Hospital at Palmers Green. Of these 70 were Scarlet Fever, 15 Diphtheria 1 Enteric Fever, 1 Erysipelas, 1 Acute Poliomyelitis, and 1 Measles. Two cases were removed to the N.E. Hospital, St. Ann's Road, Tottenham. The Infectious Sickness Rate of the District was 5.8 per 1,000 of the population, as against 7 3 in the preceding year. The rate for North Southgate was 61, and that for South Southgate was 5 6. Methods of Disinfection.—(1) For disinfection of rooms, "Formalin" is used (a) by spraying and (b) with "Paraform" tablets in the "Alformant" lamp. 19 During the year, 199 specimens were sent and reports received as follows:— Diseases Suspected. Report. Total. Positive. Negative. Diphtheria 33 82 115 Typhoid Fever 3 7 10 Phthisis 8 66 74 Total 44 155 199 N.B.—These were not all from different cases, but in many instances, chiefly of Diphtheria, were further specimens taken from the same cases at intervals for re-examination to determine when the case in question ceased to be infectious. In many cases this has to be repeated several times before a negative result is reported. (2) Bedding, etc., is disinfected in the steam disinfecting apparatus established on the premises of the Isolation Hospital. For taking the bedding, etc., to and fro, special vans are kept, one for the infected and the other tor the disinfected articles. (3) After rooms have been disinfected, the wall papers are stripped from the walls and burnt, and ceilings, walls, and all surfaces are thoroughly washed. Diagnosis Outfits.—The diagnosis outfits provided by the Council for the use of the medical practitioners in the District for sending morbid specimens from suspected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, and Phthisis to St. George's Hospital for bacteriological examination and report have been made extensive use of, and continue to prove of great service in establishing a correct diagnosis in these diseases, to the advantage of the general public health, as well as of those more immediately concerned. 20 Diphtheria Antitoxin.—The supply of diphtheria antitoxin provided by the Council and kept available for use at any time at the Council's Offices has been made full use of as occasion required, to the great advantage of those suffering from the disease and the public in general. Handbills Concerning Infectious Diseases.—Handbills giving instructions as to the danger of, and precautions to be taken to avoid spreading infection in, cases of Measles and Whooping Cough—not being notifiable diseases—are always kept in readiness, and have been left at all houses where it came to my knowledge that these diseases were present; and have also been distributed to all other houses in the immediate neighbourhood. The necessary knowledge as to where the diseases are present is supplied to me chiefly by the School Attendance Officers and the School Authorities. This system of notification of non-notifiable diseases by the School Attendance Officers and the School Authorities, instituted in 1898, continues to work as satisfactorily as can be expected. SMALL-POX. No cases were notified. With regard to the provision for the effective isolation of cases of Small-pox, Southgate is one of the thirteen Councils comprised in the district of the Middlesex Joint Small-pox Hospital Board by which the Clare Hall Small-pox Hospital has been purchased for the use of the inhabitants of the constituent district. SCARLET FEVER. There were 94 cases notified from 81 houses, as against 143 in the preceding year, 46 in 1911, and 48 in 1910. Of these, 20 were notified from North Southgate, and 74 from South Southgate. In 12 houses sanitary defects were found. 21 One case was "imported," 8 were "secondary" cases, occurring in 7 houses from which previous cases had been notified, and 3 were "return" cases from 3 houses to which previous cases had returned directly or indirectly after discharge from the Isolation Hospital. Seventy cases were removed to the Isolation Hospital. The type of the disease, as in the preceding year, was on the whole mild, and there was one death in the Isolation Hospital. DIPHTHERIA. There were 21 cases notified from 16 houses, as against 32 in the preceding year, 21 in 1911, and 44 in 1910, Of these, 6 were notified from North Southgate, and 15 from South Southgate. Three were "secondary" cases, and one was "imported" In 4 houses sanitary defects were found. Fifteen cases were removed to the Isolation Hospital. There were two deaths, one of which occurred in the Isolation Hospital, and one at the patient's home. TYPHOID FEVER. Four cases were notified, as against 5 in the preceding year, and 5 in 1911. These cases occurred in Palmers Green and Winchmore Hill, and had no connection with each other. One was an "imported" case, while no evidence of the source of infection could be obtained in the others. One case were removed to the Isolation Hospital. There was one death, which occurred at the patient's home. In one house sanitary defects were found. 22 ERYSIPELAS. Twenty-two cases were notified, as against 16 in the preceding year. One case was removed to the Isolation Hospital. In two houses sanitary defects were found. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS. Two cases were notified. One case was removed to the Isolation Hospital but exhibited no symptoms of this disease while under observation there, and was apparently a case of mistaken diagnosis. TUBERCULOSIS. During the year there were 35 deaths from Tubercular diseases, 22 of these being from Phthisis, as against 26 and 19 respectively in the preceding year. In all cases of Phthisis that have come to my knowledge leaflets have been left pointing out fully the nature and danger of the disease, and the means to be taken for the prevention of the spread of infection to others; and where rooms occupied by consumptive persons have been evacuated by death or otherwise a visit has been paid by one of the sanitary officials, and an offer to disinfect, free of cost, by the Sanitary Authority has been made and in most cases carried out. Arrangements have been made by the Hospital Board at Clare Hall Small-pox Hospital, at South Minims, to receive cases of Phthisis, three of which were admitted during the year. Arrangements have been made by the Council to supply portable shelters in necessary cases, but so far none have been required. The number of cases of Phthisis notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911, was 6. 23 The corrected number of cases belonging to this District notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations 1012, was 68. Tn 1 •» houses sanitary defects were found. The Hospital is built on a site of nine acres of land situated near the S.E. corner of the District, in Tottenhall Road, Palmers Green. It is a fine open and airy site, admirably adapted for the purpose. Only a portion of the site is at present oecupied by the Hospital premises, the remainder being let off as allotments The Hospital premises are entirely enclosed by a close-boarded fence, and there is one entrance only, in Tottenhall Road. The Hospital was opened in January, 1902, and enlarged The buildings now consist of the following : — (1) Entrance Lodge. (2; Administrative Block. (3) Two Ward Pavilions, designed to contain 10 and 12 beds respectively. (4) Isolation Pavilion, a block of four wards designed to contain 8 beds. (5) Laundry Block with steam disinfector, mortuary, patients' ambulance and clothing van sheds (the two latter were provided without a loan). ISOLATION HOSPITAL. in 1910. The following amounts have been variously sanctioned by the Local Government Board to be borrowed for the purposes of the Hospital:— (1) Purchase of land | Fencing, drainage, gas, water- i £2,500 (2) mains, levelling, drives, etc. ( Erecting Hospital Buildings ... j 15.100 (3) Furniture 1,100 Total £18,700 24 The ground occupied has been laid out with drives, flower beds, trees, shrubs, lawns, kitchen gardens, and greenswards. Paved airing-courts have been provided to each pavilion. The Ward Pavilions are used entirely for Scarlet Fever cases, and each contains two wards, one for women and children and one for males. The old wards measured 36ft. by 26ft. by 13ft. (female ward), and 26ft. by 24ft. by 13ft. (male ward); while the new wards are both 36ft. by 26ft. by 13ft. The accommodation provides for 22 patients, and each adult patient is provided with 156 square feet of floor space, and 2,028 cubic feet of air space. There are also provided in each Ward Pavilion, stores, cupboards for linen, etc., and bath-rooms arranged with glazed doors opening to the outside, so that they may be used as discharging rooms. Sanitary annexes are constructed at the ends of each ward, accessible from the ward only, and provided with cross ventilation lobbies. The Isolation Pavilion is used for Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, and doubtful cases which require isolation, and consists of a double block and containing four wards in all, designed to contain two beds in each ward and cots for young children. Each adult patient is provided with 216 square feet of floor space, and 2,808 cubic feet of air space. Each half of this pavilion has an independent entrance on opposite sides of the building, with separate verandahs, and external w.c. with special slop closets. All wards are lighted by gas and ventilated upon the most improved principles, so that thorough cross-ventilation may be well maintained. All wards are heated by regenerating stoves; those in the Scarlet Fever Wards being fixed in the centre of each ward, and having double fires connected to downward flues which are carried under the floors to ordinary external chimney shafts, 25 Duty Rooms in both Ward and Isolation Pavilions are centrally arranged so that the nurse-in-charge can look into each ward through special inspection windows. They contain kitchen ranges with hot-water apparatus, white glazed sinks, small larders, kitchen dressers, medicine cupboards, and a telephone communicating with the administrative block. The floors are of various kinds, Terrazzo, wood block, and jointless flooring, the latter having been applied to the wards, duty and bath-rooms, and sanitary annexes of the new buildings. The interior walls are plastered with Keene's cement on Portland cement, and have been coloured with washable distemper and oil painted dadoes. All internal angles of walls and woodwork have been coved and rounded. The Administrative Block contains dispensary, Matron's and Nurses' sitting-rooms, dining-room, waiting-room for patients' relatives and friends, store room, kitchen, scullery, coal store, two bath-rooms, and nineteen bedrooms (two of which contain two beds each) for the nursing staff' and servants. The building is so designed that it can readily be enlarged still further to accommodate an increased staff. The Laundry Block is fitted with a high-pressure boiler, which supplies steam for boiling all water required in the Laundry. A set of clothes-horses on runners are provided in a special chamber, heated with steam, for drying and airing clothes and linen when outdoor drying is unavailable. The same boiler also supplies steam for the steam disinfecting apparatus. Three separate coach-houses are also provided. The Entrance Lodge contains a parlour, kitchen-living-room with enclosed sink and bath, and one bedroom with usual accommodation, all under one roof and on the ground floor. The sanitary arrangements of the whole premises are perfect. Provision is made for thoroughly flushing all the foul-water drains, and special ventilating shafts have been erected. All refuse is either burned or disposed of on the enclosed area. 26 The water supply passes through a meter on a bye-pass into a 4-in. main with 3-in. branches, and is provided with a 4-in sluice valve which would be opened to supply the four hydrants in case of fire. As an additional protection against fire, tanks and buckets, always containing water, are provided in each block of buildings; and there is also a Hose Reel carrying fire-hose, stand-pipes, etc., in a special shed on the premises. Communication with the Council's Chief Fire Station can be made by telephone. The Medical and Nursing Staff consist, at present, of Medical Superintendent (non-resident), Matron (nursing), three Staff Nurses, and two Probationers ; and the Domestic Staff of Cook, Wardmaid, Laundrymaid, Housemaid, General, and Entrance Lodge Porter and his wife. When all the wards are fully occupied a larger staff of nurses are required. The Medical Superintendent's residence is connected with the Hospital by telephone. The Porter's duties consist of looking after the Entrance Lodge, checking all entries and exits, and working the steam disinfector, etc. His spare time is spent in the gardens. The Porter's wife assists, when required, in the Laundry, etc. Relatives and friends are allowed to visit patients on Sunday afternoons from two to four o'clock, but are only allowed to communicate with the patients through the windows. If any patient is dangerously ill, special arrangements are made. Patients from outside Districts, other than Friern Barnet, with whom there is a special agreement, are admitted when there is sufficient accommodation for them ; the authorities of the Districts from which they come paying the Southgate Council for their maintenance. 27 The cost of feeding staff and patients during the past year averaged 8½d. per head per day. During the year 117 eases were admitted; of these 94 were notified as Scarlet Fever, 19 as Diphtheria, 1 as Typhoid Fever, 1 as Erysiplelas, 1 as Measles, and 1 as Acute Poliomyelitis Twenty-eight of the cases were sent in by the Friern Barnet Urban District Council, of which 24 were Scarlet Fever and 4 Diphtheria. There were 2 deaths, 1 from Diphtheria and 1 from Scarlet Fever. The average times of detention in Hospital were:— For Scarlet Fever 50 days, for Diphtheria 44 days.

The greatest number of Friern Barnet patients in the Hospital at one time was 7, in October, November and December. In no other month did the number exceed 5. The daily average for the year was 3.6. MISCELLANEOUS. Return of the Metropolitan Asylums Board.— During the past year 5,162 case3 were admitted into this Hospital, situated at Winchmore Hill ; of these, 3,354 were Scarlet Fever, 524 Diphtheria, 564 Measles, 6 Whooping Cough' 709 Phthisis, and 5 other diseases. There were 54 deaths—3 from Scarlet Fever, 50 from Phthisis, and 1 from Cancer. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal.—The District is drained by the dual system. The surface-water sewers discharge at convenient points into the nearest watercourses, and as the fields adjoining the smaller courses become converted into building land, suitable sewers and culverts are provided. Where possible and necessary the surface-water sewers are laid at such depths as will enable the subsoil under cellars and basements to be drained and connected therewith, thus ensuring dry dwellings and avoiding any accumulations of stagnant water inside or beneath any dwelling-house. The main sewage sewers traverse as much as possible the natural valleys, and run from the higher lands on the west towards the east, where they are joined to the sewers of the Edmonton District at three points along the boundary between the Southgate and Edmonton Districts. By the Edmonton Local Board Separation Act, 1881, by which Southgate became a separate District, the Edmonton District is required to receive, 29 convey, and dispose of the sewage of Southgate. Only one length of sewer, apart from culverts, is now constructed of brickwork, that length being the southern main joining the Edmonton sewers. The sewers are laid principally in open trenches, but as their depth is in some cases as much as 30 feet below the surface, the driving of short tunnels as headings is occasionally resorted to Pymmes Brook is crossed in several places by means of inverted syphons. These have been constructed with iron pipes from special designs, which permit the smallest area of sewage being exposed in the manholes, and have worked very satisfactorily. The sewers are also carried at several points under the New River, and a few years ago the late New River Company insisted upon a special system being adopted, by which large cast-iron shield pipes are forced by means of powerful hydraulic jacks through the soil under the river, thus forming tunnels in which the sewage pipes are laid. In the case of new streets, no new sewers are permitted to be covered up until the work has been thoroughly inspected and tested with water. The pipes used have special joints, are made of the strongest stoneware clays, and laid upon a thick bed of cement concrete. In addition, they arc laid to absolutely straight lines from point to point, and by means of manholes can be examined and seen through from end to end. At the head of every branch sewer means for Hushing are provided by lampholes and flushing chambers, through which thousands of gallons of clean water are systematically delivered in order to prevent any deposit within the sewers. There are upwards of 100 of these flushing chambers within the district. Fortunately, all the sewers may be said to be self-cleansing, and within an hour or two of any foul matter being discharged into a drain or sewer it is delivered at the Edmonton Sewage Works. The sewers are ventilated by means of gratings over the manholes and by upcast shafts ; but the gratings intended to be 30 inlets for fresh air sometimes also discharge foul air, in consequence of which many of them have been closed in, and extra upcast shafts erected at points of vantage in their place. During the past twenty years no drains of any house have been permitted to be connected with the sewers unless they have been provided with a chamber containing a trapped interceptor just within the boundary adjoining the street or road. There are very few houses which are not near a sewer, so that fortunately only a few cesspools now exist. In the District there are now 49 miles 292 yds. of sewage sewers, and 45¼ miles of surface-water sewers, and no less than 50½, miles of these have been constructed during the past twelve years. Sewers.—During the past year a total of 3,645 yards of new sewers were laid as follows : — Sewage sewers 1,944 yards. Surface-water sewers 1,701 „ Total 2 miles 125 „ Roads.—In the District there are now upwards of 48 miles of roads, made up as follows :— Miles. Yards. County Main Roads 4 562 Other Roads (repairable by the inhabitants at large) 37 700 Private Roads (repairable by the owners of property abutting on such Roads) 6 1,701 Total 48 1203 The following Private Streets were Made-up in accordance with the 150th Sec. Public Health Act, 1875, during the year, and will be taken over by the Council. 31 Chimes Avenue 147 yards lin. Kelvin Avenue 314 „ „ Haslemere Road (part of) 112 „ „ Back Street between Park Avenue and Windsor Road 103 „ „ Back Street between Windsor and Osborne Roads 93 ,, „ Total 769 yards Jin. The following new streets have been laid out and sewered during the year :— Laurel Cottage Estate 691 yards lin. Berkshire Gardens, Truro Estate 353 „ „ Grovelands by Laurel Cottage Estate 370 „ „ Grovelands Bourne Hill to Park 140 „ „ 1554 yards. Water Supply.—Practically the whole District is now supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. There are now only 7 wells left from which water is obtained for drinking. These are principally in North Southgate. Watercourses —Bounds Green Brook and Pymmes Brook remain in about the same condition. The periodical cleansing by the Middlesex County Council greatly improves their condition. OPEN AIR SWIMMING BATH This Bath, situated at Barrowell Green, was opened to the public on 14th August, 1913. The length of the bath is 150ft. and the width 50ft. The accommodation comprises attendants' offices, slipper-bath, foot-bath, laundry, sanitary conveniences, enclosed dressing accommodation for 30 bathers, and two family dressing-boxes. Provision has already been made for the future heating of the water, by means of the boiler in the 32 adjoining Destructor Works. The Bath has been well patronised and bids fair to be most successful. It is proposed to build a cottage adjoining the offices of the bath for the Superintendent and his wife (both of whom teach swimming), and 27 additional dressing-boxes are in course of erection, also an additional family dressing-box, an open drying shed, and cycle accommodation. The ground on the north and cast sides of the bath has been laid out as shrubberies, providing an elective finish to the slopes. House Refuse Collection.—The collection of house refuse is under the control of this department, while the disposal of the same at the Council's Destructor is under the control of the Surveyor. The refuse is collected weekly, and the number of vanloads collected was 5,934, and the weight 7,646 tons 14 cwt. Very few complaints of non-collection were received during the year. Collection of Fish Offal.—The fish offal from fish shops is removed in air-tight receptacles twice or three times weekly, by a Contractor who charges the fishmongers a certain sum per week, according to the quantity of fish offal collected. THE SOUTHGATE URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL ACT, 1913. This Act, which confers upon the Council various powers " with respect to Street and Buildings in their District, and with "respect to the Health Local Government, and Sanitation of the " District," received the Royal Assent on the 15th day of August, 1913. HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, &c., ACT, 1909. During September, 1910, the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, under Sec. 17, came Into operation, by 33 which local authorities are required to carry out the systematic inspection of dwelling-houses throughout their Districts, to take all necessary action, and to keep detailed records. During the past year inspections have been carried out in each Ward of the District, and a summary of the results attained is appended. Special care and attention has been devoted to the working of this Act, and following the inspection of any particular property the owner or owners were invited to meet the Inspectors, and a number of interviews have taken place. The powers and obligations contained in the Act have been explained generally, and all due consideration has been accorded to individual circumstances. This attitude has in several instances decided the owners to carry out the various specified requirements, and in such cases the serving of Closing Orders has been rendered unnecessary. One real difficulty arising in connection with the closing of dwellings is the need of suitable accommodation for the tenants liable to displacement. In a neighbourhood where the development of villa property is assured, very few cottages suitable for the working classes are likely to be erected by private enterprise. The Council has foreseen this difficulty, and has now erected 82 cottages under the Housing Acts, which are let to selected Tenants at the following weekly rents:—16 at 5/6; 4 at 6/6; 46 at 7/-; 14 at 7/6; and 2 at 8/-, yielding a total rental of £1,448 per annum, the losses in respect of empty houses and irrecoverables being practically nil. The revenue from these cottages is sufficient to cover all outgoings, including loan repayments and interest. Workmen's dwellings are urgently required in the Winchmore Hill portion of the District, and a scheme for the development of the 10 acres of land at Highfield Road, purchased by the Council in 1911, has been submitted to the Local Government Board. It is proposed to erect, in all, about 160 34 Cottages, and the Estate, owing to its close proximity to a new Elementary School, the Council's Swimming Bath, and the Metropolitan Electric Tramways, and its general adaptability to the purpose, will, it is anticipated, meet a long-felt want, and prove to be an undertaking of which the Council will have every reason to be proud. Total number of dwelling-houses inspected (under Sec. 17) 195 Number of houses found to be in a state dangerous or injurious to health (under Sec. 17) 7 Number of Closing Orders served by the Council (under Sec. 17) 5 Number of houses made habitable without Closing Orders 46 ,, „ closed voluntarily 7 ,, Closing Orders determined after repairs (Sec. 17) 3 „ of houses demolished voluntarily 14 PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. Medical Inspection under the Education Act, 1907. The County Medical Officer is the School Medical Officer for this District, and organises and supervises the work. The inspections are carried out by an Assistant School Medical Officer. A routine examination of the children was made at each school during each of the school terms. Arrangements for these visits are made beforehand, and the parents are summoned to them. Total number of Children inspected:— Boys. Girls. 5 years old group 211 180 8 years old group 213 171 13 years old group, and over 139 144 Other ages 79 82 642 577 Total 1,219 35 In addition to the routine inspections, other visits are made for the purpose of " following up " those children found to have some defective condition, and to see the result of treatment. Children suffering from a chronic form of defect e g., ringworm, etc., are kept under special observation. In connection with the occurrence of infectious disease amongst scholars, a system of intercommunication between the Public Health Department of the District Council and the Medical Officer of the Education Department has been established on the lines suggested in the Memorandum of the Board of Education and Local Government Board relating to '' Closure of and Exclusion from School," and by this means the two authorities have been of mutual and useful assistance to each other. The Education Authority has also provided for the prompt notification to the Medical Officer of Health of the District, on special forms, of cases of non-notifiable complaints, e.g.. Measles, Whooping Cough, etc. Public Conveniences.—None have as yet been provided, but the Council's Surveyor has prepared plans for one at Palmers Green, which is now under consideration. The need for them in various parts of the District is being felt more and more each year, especially at Palmers Green, as the population continues to increase at a rapid rate, in addition to which there is a large train and omnibus traffic in the District. Certain conveniences attached to publichouses to which there is direct access from public thoroughfares are kept lighted and systematically cleansed by the Council. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops.—These have been regularly inspected, and in most cases were found to be kept in a satisfactory condition. There are some 200 cows owned by 10 cowkeepers. The cows are inspected quarterly by Mr. W. R. Davis, M.R.C.V.S., the Veterinary Surgeon appointed by the Council for that purpose. 36 During the year on case of tuberculosis of the udder was found. The following is an extract from the report of the Veterinary Surgeon for the quarter ending September 30th, 1913:—"The cows were found to be in good condition, much improved in this respect to what they were two years ago. There is also an improvement in the cleaning and grooming of the cows." Bakehouses.—All the Bakehouses (17 in number) were inspected frequently during the year. There are on underground Bakehouses in use in the District. MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION. There are eight slaughter-houses in the District. Several of these slaughter-houses, as mentioned in my last Annual Report, are in unsuitable positions owing to their close proximity to dwelling-houses. Some of them are little used, and all have been systematically inspected, particularly at night when slaughtering is in progress. Five hundred and forty-nine visits were made to these premises by your Inspectors during the year This gives a better opportunity of observing the condition of the animals before the organs and offal are taken away. The tendency of the butchers is to facilitate the work of the Inspectors and should any carcase be doubtful it is put on one side for inspection. During the year 34 pigs were found when slaughtered to be tuberculous, 8 of which were in a condition of general tuberculosis. 2,784 pounds (approximately) of meat was surrendered and destroyed. 50 pounds of fish was voluntarily surrendered. 280 pounds of fruit was voluntarily surrendered. The fish and fruit shops are kept well under observation. 37 The following table shows the number of pigs slaughtered and examined, with carcases found to be affected with tuberculosis. :— No. of pigs examined. No. found tuberculous. Percentage, 1,467 34 2.3 The duties under the Food and Drugs Acts are administered by the Middlesex County Council.
