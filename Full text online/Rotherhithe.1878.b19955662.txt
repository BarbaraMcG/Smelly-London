It has been resolved that in future the Vestry repair the trenches opened in the roads and streets of this Parish by the Gas and Water Companies, and charge the cost thereof to the respective Companies upon the basis of the Vestry's Contract for Paving Jobbing Works. 15 In March, 1879, the Vestry presented a Memorial to the Metropolitan Hoard of Works (in support of a similiar Memorial presented to the Board by the Vestry of the Parish of St. Mary, Islington) praying that Board to promote a bill in Parliament for the amendment of the 78th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act (25th and 26th Vict., c. 102), by making the cost of flagging footways laid out at the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act (18 and 19 Vict., c. 120), chargeable upon the Owners of property in or abutttng thereon, instead of, as at present, upon the occupiers. A communication has since been received from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Board of Works stating the Board does not consider it advisable, under ail the circumstances, to apply to Parliament for an amendment of the Acts relating to the paving of old footpaths.

Edward James Talbot, John Bulmer, Robert Foottit, Francis John Bisley, Reuben Henry Williams, Junior, and Lawrence Stevens as a Committee to watch the progress of the said bills through Parliament and report from time to time to the Vestry. The bill of the London Tramways Company (Limited) was ultimately withdrawn and the bill of the promoters of the Southwark and Deptford Tramways was passed into Law. 'The Committee before mentioned had several conferences with the Chairman and the Solicitor of the Promotors of the Smthwark and Deptford Tramways, with reference to the clauses of the agreement and conditions as to the works to be executed by the Promotors of the said Tramwav on the carrying out of their scheme and the same were ultimately agreed to by the Vestry upon the report of the Committee.

Bayley & Co., and Messrs. Hora, and the Vestry on the recommendation of the committee, purchased 5 Hydrostatic Vans of Messrs. Bayley & Co. at £60 each, and 2 Watering Vans of Messrs.

The Vestry received four Tenders for the same and ultimately accepted the Tender of Mr. Edward Machin for a lease of the said land for 80 years from the 25th December, 1878, at the following rents : for the first year of the said term, a peppercorn; for the 2nd and 3rd years, the rent of £46 5s. and for the 4th and following years of the said term, the full rent of £185 per annum, payable quarterly. Mr. Machin on the 31st December, 1878, executed an agreement with the Feoffee.- and Trustees of the Charity Lands belonging to this parish, to pay the said rent as aforesaid; to construct at his own cost, all proper roads, footpaths, sewers, gulleys, and drainage works for the said land and for the houses to be erected thereon, also within 22 three years from the date of the agreement, to erect, cover in, and completely finish tit for habitation, 74 private dwelling houses on the said piece of land in the positions shewn on the plan before mentioned, 25 of which houses to be built and completed fit for habitation on or before the 25th day of December, 1879; 25 more of such houses on or before the 25th day of December, 1880, and the remainder on or before the 25th day of December, 1881, but the Lessee to be at liberty by or before the last mentioned time (if he shall think fit) to erect a Public House at one of the corners of the intended new Road, in which case the number of private houses was to be reduced to 72. Mr. Machin further entered into a Bond with two sureties in the penal sum of £1,000 for the due performance of his said agreement. Canal Boats Act, 1877. 40th & 41st Vic. cap. 60. The Vestry of this Parish were by an Order of the Local Government Board dated 17th May, 1878 (made under the provisions of "An Act to provide for the Registration and Regulation of Canal Boats used as dwellings"), appointed the Registration Authority for the Grand Surrey Canal, and in December, 1878, they accepted the offer of Dr. Browning, the Medical Officer of Health, to take the duty of inspecting the Boats, &c., for Registration under the provisions of the said Act, for twelve months gratuitously and appointed him- accordingly to that office. Two Canal Boats only have been Registered in this parish since the Act came into operation. Baths and Wash Houses Acts. At a Special Meeting of the Vestry of Rotherhithe held on the 30th of July, 1878, duly convened for the special purpose of determining whether the Act of the Session held in the 9th and 10th years of the Reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, cap. 74, intituled "An Act to encourage the establishment of Public Baths and Wash Houses," and the several Acts amending the same, should be adopted tor the Parish of Rotherhithe, it was unanimously RESOLAED that the Act of the Session held in the 9th and 10th years of the Reign ot Her Majesty Queen Victoria, cap. 74, intituled "An Act to encourage the establishment ol Public Baths and Wash Houses,' and the several Acts amending the same ought to be, and are hereby adopted for this Parish of Rotherhithe. In September, 1878, the Vestry received the Local Government Board's formal approval of the adoption of the Baths and Wash Houses Acts for this Parish. 23 On the 5th of November, 1878, the Vestry resolved to appoint seven Commissioners to carry out the provisions of the said Act in this Parish, and dulyappointed the following gentlemen as such Commissioners, viz.: Messrs. Francis John Bisley, John Bulmer, Daniel Serle, Edward James Talbot, Edward John Cox, Lawrence Stevens, and Thomas William Clarke. The Vestry at the same time appointed the following gentlemen to be Auditors of Accounts under the same Acts, viz.: Messrs. John Henry Morris and Ralph Westall Walker. The Commissioners on the 4th March, 1879, reported to the Vestry that they had, subject to the approval of the Vestry, agreed to take a Lease for the term of 99 years at the yearly Kent of £80, of the ground and premises on the North side of gomm Road known as Augusta Lodge, in the occupation of Mr. Christopher Case, and of the premises formerly known as Hope Cottages, but then numbered 66 and 68, Deptford Lower Road, in the occupation of Mr. Mariton, also that they had agreed, subject as aforesaid, to purchase the Leasehold interest of Mr. H. T. Standfast, in Augusta Lodge, namely 20 years from Christmas, 1878. Ground Kent £17 10s. (subject to a Lease granted by him to Mr. Christopher Case, for the whole of bis term, less three days, at a yearly Rent of £55, for the sum of £425, and to pay all expenses of transfer, also to purchase the leasehold interest as aforesaid of Mr. Christopher Case, in the said premises, for the sum of £500, and to pay all expense- of transfer, and to purchase the leasehold interest of Mr. Marriton, in Nos. 66 and 68, Deptford Lower Road, aforesaid, namely, 19 years from Christmas, 1878, Ground Rent £28 per annum, for the sum of £450, and to pay all expenses of transfer, and that the Commissioners required to borrow the sum of £1,500 to complete the said purchase- and to provide for the necessary expenses attendant thereon, and the Commissioner- asked the Vestry for their approval to the proposed Contracts and for their sanction to the borrowing from the Metropolitan Board of Works of the said sum cf £1,500 as a first instalment of the sum they would ultimately require for defraying the cost attending the erection of the buildings, it was "RESOLVED that this Vestry approve of the Commissioners for Public Hatband Wash Houses in this Parish, entering into Contracts with the several parties above named for the purchase of their Leasehold interests in the several Premises above mentioned and for taking the same Premise- on Lease from the Freeholders for a term of 99 years, at the yearly Rent of £80 per annum, and further that this Vestry hereby sanction the Commissioners borrowing at interest from the Metropolitan Board of Work- the sum of £1,500 on security of a Mortgage of the Rates for the relief of the Poor of this Parish such sum of £1,500 to be applied by them in payment of the said purchase monies and of the necessary expenses attendant on the said purchases or otherwise for the purposes of the Act to encourage the establishment of Public Baths and Wash Houses and the several Acts amending the same, and as a first instalment of the amount they will ultimately require to defray the Costs attendant upon the erection of the buildings. 24 Miscellaneous. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 2nd of April, 1878, a petition signed by residents of the lower part of Bermondsev, Rotherhithe, and Hatcham, addressed to the South Eastern Railway Company, praying for the opening of a New Station on that line of Railway at or near the old Commercial Dock Station was presented to the Vestry for the signatures of the Vestrymen, the petition was accordingly signed by the Vestrymen in attendance at the Meeting, and it was " RESOLVED that the Vestry present a Memorial under their Common Seal to the South Eastern Railway Company in support of the before mentioned petition of the inhabitants for the formation of a new Station on the South Eastern Railway in this Parish at or near the Rotherhithe New Road." Subsequently a Deputation consisting of Messrs. John Bulmer, Robert Foottit, Robert Allen, and Lawrence Stevens with the Clerk, waited upon the Directors of the South Eastern Railway Company, by appointment, at their offices, and presented the said Memorial of the Vestry in favour of a New Station being formed upon the line of Railway near the Rotherhithe New Road, in the neighbourhood of the old Commercial Dock Station. The Directors having heard the deputation, appeared to look upon the application favourably and arranged that Sir Edw. Watkin, the Chairman, and Mr. Shaw the Manager and Secretary should meet the deputation upon the spot and inspect the locality, and on the 18th June, 1878, the deputation met Sir E. Watkin and Mr. Shaw, and accompanied them through the District immediately contiguous to the old Commercial Dock Station and also the new neighbourhood lying between Retherhithe New Road and Southwark Park Road. At a joint meeting of the Vestries of St. John, St. Thomas and St. Olave, Southwark, and the Vestry of the Parish held on the 12th June, 1878, at St. Olave's Vestry Hall, John Tolhurst, Esq. was duly re-elected a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works. At the General Meeting of the Vestry of this Parish held on the 4th June, 1878, it was moved by Mr. John Bulmer and seconded by Mr. James Powell, and unaminously RESOLA LD that the best thanks of this Vestry be given to John Tolhurst, Esq. tor his assiduous attention to the requirements and interests of this prrish as its Representative jointly with the District of St. Olave, at the Metropolitan Board of Works, during his past three years of office as a Member of the Board, and also for his kindness and courtesy in attending the monthlv meetings of the Vestry." On the 5th July, 1878, Mr. John Tolhurst on behalf of the Vestry, presented a Memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works, as follows : 25 To the Metropolitan Board of Works : The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the County of Surrey, 8HEWETH : That your Memorialists Parish is united with the Parishes of St. John, Horselydown, St. Olave, and St. Thomas, Southwark forming the District of St. Olave, Southwark, for the purpose of electing from time to time a Member of the Metropolitan Board of Works, as provided by section 47 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and as included in Schedule "B" to that Act. That your Memorialists' Parish has greatly increased in size and rateable value since the passing of the said Act in 1855, the gross rateable value at that time being £83,575 15s. and the net rateable value £64,672 15s., while at the present time the gross rateable value is £230,366 and the net rateable value £186,816, thus showing an increase on the gross of £146,790 5s. and in the net of £122,143 5s. and the said parish is still increasing. That during the past ten years, a large area of ground situate within your Memorialists' parish, formerly used as Market Garden Ground, has been converted into building land and numerous Streets have been formed and laid out, and many hundreds of houses erected thereon, the population being nearly double what it was at the taking of the census in 1851. That under these circumstances your Memorialists consider that the time has arrived when the said parish should have a separate Representative at your Honourable Board. That your Memorialists therefore pray your Honourable Board will be pleased in the event of a Bill being introduced into Parliament for the amendment of the Metropolis local Management Act, to obtain the insertion therein of a clause, giving power to increase the number of Representatives to your Honourable Board, and for enabling your Memorialists to elect their separate Representative thereto. And your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. (Signed) HAWKS & STOKES, (L.S.) Clerks. The Memorial was referred by the Board to their Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration and report. On the invitation of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, this Vestry in July, 1878, appointed the following gentlemen, viz.: Messrs. Edward James Talbot, Francis John Bisley, Reuben Henry Williams, Junior, Ralph Wentall Walker, Lawrence Stevens, Richard Brownly and Henry Hayward, as a Deputation to assist the Vestry 26 of St. James's, Westminster, in obtaining an inquiry under the authority of a Royal Commission into the character of the funds in the possession of certain Public Societies in the Metropolis in order to ascertain how far they might be diverted to the relief of the increasing burdens of the Ratepayers. The Deputation attended several Meetings of the Delegates appointed by the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis, at the Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, and ultimately a Memorial to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department was adopted for presentation, soliciting that a Royal Commission with parliamentary powers be appointed to enquire into the present condition and management of the property and charities of the several parishes of the Metropolis and of the City Guilds, with a view to consider and determine what are the proper objects to which the property of these Companies should in the present day be applied, and for the better application of charitable funds. The Metropolitan Board of Works having refused to sanction an application made by Messrs. Still & Son for the approval of a plan for the formation of new Roads of various widths to lead out of the West side of Deptford Lower Road, the Vestrv in March, 1879, presented the following Memorial to that Board, viz. : To the Honourable the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Memorial of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the County of Surrey, under their Common Seal. SHEWETH, That an application was recently made to your Honourable Board by Messas. Still and Son, the Solicitors for the Freeholders, for your sanction to laying out for building purposes a piece of ground situate in the rear of the Deptford Lower Road, Rotherhithe now and for many years past used as gardens to Culloden House and Almond Tree House, abutting upon Southwark Park and containing about two acres. That your Honourable Board communicated with your Memorialists w ith reference to the application, and your Memorialists having fully considered the matter, resolved, that inasmuch as the proposed new Road would not have two entrances of the full width thereof, opening from the ground upwards, and the entrance roads thereto would not be ot the width ot 40 feet, they considered the plan submitted to be very objectionable and duly informed your Honourable Board of this decision, and they have since received an intimation that your Honourable Board has declined to accede to the application. our Memorialists are of opinion that it will be most advantageous and beneficial to the whole ot that part of South London which participates in the benefits afforded by Southwark Park as a place of recreation and public resort, that the opportunity which now presents itself of extending the area of the park should be taken advantage of. The present area of the park is smaller than any other in London, yet the population ot the parishes abutting thereon, is in comparison equal to that of the parishes abutting upon Victoria and Finsbury Parks, and your Memorialists desire specially to point out to your Honourable Board that ever since the opening of Southwark Park in 27 1869, many acred of land in Rotherhithe situate in the immediate vicinity of 'the park, which were then used as market ground, have been built upon and many hundreds of houses erected thereon, all of which are tenanted, so that the population of Rotherhithe alone has considerably increased with in the last ten years ; again extensive building operations have been going on in the adjacent Parish of Bermondsey during the same period and at the present time applications are before your Honourable Board and your Memorialists with reference to laying out, for building purposes,. other largre pieces of land in your Memorialists Parish. In the summer months the Park is much resorted to, and the portion allotted for Cricketing is densely crowded with Cricketers and children at play, and accidents are by no means uncommon in consequence of children and others being struck by cricket balls, the space being somewhat limited in consequence of the limited area of the park. Your Memorialists consider it would confer a great public boon if your Honourable Hoard will purchase the ground above referred to and add it to the park and lay it out as to your Honourable Board may seem most advisable as a recreation ground or otherwise, for the benefit of the inhabitants of the surrounding district and their children, and your Memorialists therefore pray that your Honourable Board will be pleased to take the above facts into your early and favourable consideration, and to purchase the said ground for the purpose of adding it to Southwark Park as a recreation ground or otherwise for the benefit of the inhabitants of the surrounding districts and of the public at large. And your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. Sealed by Order of the Vestry, of the Parish of Rotherhithe, this 13th day of March, 1879. Seal. (Signed) HAWKS & STOKES, Clerks to the Vestry. The Metropolitan Board of Works referred the said Memorial to their Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration. On the re-building of the Barley Mow P. H. Paradise Street, the Vestry approved of the alteration and widening of the passageway on the South side of the same communicating between Paradise Street and Clark's Orchard, as, proposed by Mr. W. Whale the owner to be carried out at his own expense. The Vestry also approved of the frontage line for the adjacent new houses in Paradise Street subject to the remainder of the ground beyond such new line being thrown into the public way. By Order of the Metroplitan Board of Works the whole line of thoroughfare extending from Cherry Garden Steam Boat Pier to the Commercial Dock Steam Boat Pier ha* been named Rotherhithc Street, and the houses therein re-numbered, also the 28 thoroughfare formerly known as Jamaica Level, has been re-named Southwark Park Road, and the houses there re-numbered. The Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. Under the provisions of the above Act, the total assessment of properties in this Parish has been increased during the past year as follows, viz. : Gross Value. Rateable Value. From £233,375 0s. 0d. £186,493 0s. 0d. To £239,759 0s. 0d. £193,841 0s. 0d. APPENDIX No. 1. ANNUAL REPORT of The MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. From 1st January, 1878, to December 31st 1878. To THE VESTRY of the PARISH of St. MARY, ROTHERHITHE, Surry. Gentlemen, The twenty-three years which have lapsed since the various Local Governing bodies of the Metropolis were first authorized to appoint "Medical practitioners of skill and experience to act as their advisers in matters of Public Health, have, in this Parish particularly, been marked by so many improvements in municipal regulations and minute topography, that a comparison of the condition of Rotherhithe then and now. may not, in this my first annual Report, be without interest. I will remind you that in 1856, Rotherhithe was supposed to be one of the most insalubrious suburban districts*, being almost entirely unsewered, marshy, with a scanty water supply, and that so contaminated, as to be usually refused even by horses from other parts of town, who had to bait while * And is to this day so deseribed in many Medical text-books. 30 passing through it; intersected, in every direction, by fifteen miles, length of open, foetid and stagnant ditches (called in some official documents still extant. "Stygian Pools" ) serving "the double debt to pay" of water-source and cesspool; with its population of 15,000, mostly compressed into a narrow river-side street, backed generally by blind alleys and courts, amidst which numerous offensive manufactories flourished unchecked, and where the various agues, fevers, and other communicable diseases could at any time be seen without protracted quest; that the average annual death-rate was thirty per thousand, and the fever-rate twenty-three per thousand*, that no public recreation ground, no provision for systematic removal of nuisances, nor for isolation of infectious diseases existed: and that as I write, its 886 statute acres and 2¾ miles of Thames foreshore, though carrying over 33,000 inhabitants and 5000 houses below the Trinity Level Mark, can be favourably compared as to airiness, dry, gravelly subsoil, cleanliness, good drainage, water supply, and sanitary improvement from time to time, with any "ouvrier" quarter of the Metropolis; that with us, malarious illnesses and open ditches are unknown ; that noisome trade factories exist in only two or three sites (chartered, I regret to say, by prescriptive rights): finally, that our Park attracts visitors from all South London: that communicable disease, as a rule, visits us more mildly than it docs our neighbours, and that our whole annual death-rate and zymotic or fever-rate for the last decade averaged but 18.6 per thousand, and 3.6 per thousand respectively, so that while we have quite doubled in numbers and density per acre, our mortality is diminished by nearly one half. Facts like these, with the rapid development of Sanitary knowledge, are calculated to raise a confident expectation that, assisted by the advanced public standard of general education which must then be every where prevalent, future Boards will, in a corresponding period see their vital statistics closely approximating the "Normas of Sanitation" so ably deduced by Mr. Edwin Chadwick. I have now to state in detail the 1878 Rotherhithe Sanitary History, premising that as for the first six months of the year, your Health Routine was not under my direction, I must, as a recently-appointed Officer, request your kind indulgence for any inaccuracies or omissions you may remark. This past twelvemonth has been, on the whole, a healthy one: the birth-rate higher, and the death-rate lower, than our own of 1877, or of the whole Metropolis in the same time. Two outbreaks of imported Typhus Fever (introduced here by infected bedding brought from neighbouring parishes), have but slightly affected our Returns, since the prompt action you empowered your Officers to take, at once stamped out the malady; and the epidemics of Small-pox, Whooping-cough and Diarrhoea which occurred, though severe at first, were speedily checked by similar means. Although the number of deaths from Scarlatina and the other chief Zymotic (or communicable) diseases was in excess of those observed in 1877, there was a marked diminuation of the Infantile deaths generally. To this point I must again allude. * 1st. General Report of Health of Towns Commission. 31 POPULATION. Our population, floating and on terra firma, enumerated in accordance with the plan of the Registrar-General, to the end of June 1878, amounted to 33,20.3, figures which bear to the estimated population of the Inner Metropolitan Ring a ratio of about one to one hundred and eight. The density was 37.4 per acre. BIRTHS, MARRIAGES, AND DEATHS. 1380 Births, 22.5 Marriages, and 766 Deaths were registered in the Parish. The three public Institutions (the River, the Docks, and the St. Olave's Workhouse), increased our gross Mortality by the entry of several (140) Non-parishioners. BIRTH RATE. The Birth-rate was 41.5 per thousand annually*, more by '.2 per thousand than that of preceding year, and by 5.0 than the average of last decenniad. This shows a population augmenting, and is an improvement on the time of the commencement of the "Bills of Mortality." when the Births and Deaths were equal. MARRIAGE RATE. The annual Marriage Rate was 6.4 per thousand; 2.9 below the 1877 Rate, and below the previous ten years' average. This is one of the many evidences of commercial depression we must all have noticed. VARIOUS DEATH RATES. The gross death-rate was 23.2 per thousand per annum, hut the large number of Don residential deaths recorded (owing to the reception of Paupers from other Districts into the St. Olive's Workhouse, the frequent accidents occurring to Strangers in the Docks, and the many bodies from the Thames which you have to receive and inter,) greatly reduced this, and, following the method pursued by both my predecessors, I have computed the "corrected death-rate of 1878, as 18.8 per thousand. * Any "rate per thousand" can at once be converted to "rate per cent." simply moving the decimal point one place to the left; and conversely the "rate per cent." may be altered to "rate per thousand " by moving the decimal point one place to the right. 32 This is an excess of .2 per thousand beyond the average of the ten years last passed, but a diminution from the last year's death-rate of 2.3 per thousand. The "child death-rate" (that of all children under 5 years) was 43.1 per cent., and the "infant death-rate" (of children not one year old) 33.5 per cent., as against 48.3 and 38.7 of the 1868—1877 average. The death-rate for London in. 1878 was 23.5 per thousand, and for the "Outer Circle" or "Greater London," 22.3—as against 21.9 and 20.7 per thousand respectively in 1877, and for the 23 large Towns of the United Kingdom 24.4. Whilst therefore, our total corrected death and child-rates have diminished since 1877, and the former is lower than in either London or Greater London, last year's Metropolitan death-rate is higher since 1877, by 1.6 per thousand, and the mean of the 23 large Towns by 1.4 per thousand. In the same period, our mortality was but 2.6 per thousand beyond that of the healthiest large Town mentioned by the Registrar General (Dover, with a death-rate of 16.2), and 108 per thousand lower than the most sickly (Dublin, with 29.6). We were but .8 per thousand above the rate of the healthiest foreign City, (Philadelphia, U.S. with 18), and 29.2 per thousand below that of the most unhealthy (Madras, with 48). Rotherhithe, you will probably agree with me, is not insalubrious. But whilst we may congratulate ourselves on the comparatively small death-toll which, relatively to many other centres of population, we have to pay, we must not forget that the best standard of the healthy condition of a neighbourhood is the lowness of the "child death-rate." The subjoined facts prove that in our district, this is higher than it should be. Of 100,000 children of all classes born alive in all England, 74,000 are living on the completion of their fifth year. Amongst a like number of the "upper classes," 87,000 survive their fifth birthday, 90,000 of the peerage, and only 48,000 of Rotherhithe. This loss of over 26,000 young lives, which might by improved hygiene be preserved, is chiefly due to diarrhoea and infantile convulsions, impure water and improper or insufficient nourishment (in quality as well as quantity), acute chest affections, from impure air and faulty ventilation and clothing, and contagious diseases of children, from want of isolation of the sick. We certainly are in advance of most large towns, where the deaths of children under 5 years usually make up 50 per cent. of the total deaths, and of some where it occasionally reaches 60, and even 90 per cent.! and we are steadily improving, year by year; but seeing that our " total death-rate "very little exceeds that of the healthiest parts of England, I trust that eventually, our "child death-rate" will more nearly resemble the latter. See Tables I. and II. 33 CAUSES OF DEATH. 1.—Zymotic Disease. The Deaths registered under this important heading, which comprises the continued fevers, Small-pox, Measles, Scarlatina, Whooping-cough, Diarrhœa, and Diphtheria (which are usually returned as "the seven principal Diseases" ) and other " communicable" or "infectious" diseases, as well as those due to special blood poisoning, amounted to 184. The "seven principal Diseases" had 155 victims, 110 of whom were children under 5 years, Choleraic Diarrhœra (so called "English Cholera" ) with 4 instances, Rheumatism, Alcoholism, Dysentery, Carbuncle, Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas, Quinsy, Thrush, and Croup, made up the balance. A tabular statement of the chief points respecting the "principal diseases" is appended. The others were few in number, and of sporadic nature. To the extent of their cognisance and powers, all possible means of precaution and prevention were carried out by your Officers from time to time, and the spread of disease was much checked thereby. The few cases of typhus and diphtheria were both traced to their origin and stamped out; but the outbreaks of enteric fever, measles, diarrhoea, and whooping cough were decidedly epidemic, the three last being most fatal, as such patients are with difficulty, if at all, isolated at home, and no provision is made for their treatment in special Hospitals. The total Zymotic death-rate was 5.5 per 1000, the special 4.6. The special child Zymotic rate was 3.9 per 1000. For the years 1868, 1877 the means were 9.0 per 1000 and 4.8 per 1000. Of these communicable diseases, perhaps the most loathsome, and certainly the most fatal when allowed to have its "own sweet will," is small pox; how its ravages can be diminished by vaccination, and how fatal it is when unopposed, may be seen by a perusal of the following statements which I extract from the Report of the Medical Superintendent of the Small-pox Hospital, at Homerton. Persons of all ages and bothe sexes. Mortality. Class I .—Vaccinated with good marks. 3.32 per cent. „ II. „ imperfect do. 11.10 „ „ III.—Said to be vaccinated but showing no marks 27.23 „ IV.—Unvaccinated. 45.76 „ Balance in favour of well marked vaccination 42.44 per cent. 34 Amongst Unvaccinated Persons.

CLASS II.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. In this class, Gout was fatal twice. Dropsy and Cancer, both outward and visible signs of inward Disease affecting the general economy, each ten times. The three gave a death-rate of .2 per thousand. The "Tubercular" or "Consumptive" Maladies carried off 118 persons; "Phthisis" or "Consumption" destroying 92 of all ages; Scrofula, Mesenteric disease, and " Water on the Brain making up the total. The constitutional death-rate amounted to 4.2 per thousand. The tubercular death-rate was 3.5 per thousand, and its child-rate 1.02 per thousand. III.—Local Diseases. Under this division, the various generally known and dreaded affections of the several vital organs of the human frame are ranged. 260 of these deaths were tabulated. Brain Diseases of all kinds, amongst young and old, gave 104 deaths. Heart Diseases 19, Diseases of the Organs of Respiration 103, of the Digestive Organs 20, of the Secretory and Locomotor Organs, 14. The Local death-date was 7.8 per thousand, and its child-rate 4.3. IV.—Developmental Diseases. These, which affect children, adults and aged persons at the three lite climacterics, and persons of all ages and impaired vital stamina, cost 133 lives: 21 premature births were fatal, nine children died in "teething," 2 from 35 malformation of the heart, one from diseased spine, and, happily, only one woman perished in child-birth. 48 old people succumbed to nature's decay, and 54 in all to varieties of malnutrition and debility, 28 of these being children. This class must be credited with a fatality of 4.0 per 1000: its child-rate was 1.2 per thousand. CLASS V.—VIOLENT DEATHS. These were chiefly due to drowning. The reach of the Thames on which Rotherhithe is placed, its long foreshore, and large dock-water area, with the active and sometimes perilous occupations pursued therein, are alone the cause of a numerically formidable death-roll. Numerous floating bodies are from time to time received by our Coroner's Officer: and from the heavy road traffic, street accidents are not uncommon. The 50 Inquests held resulted in a finding of violent death in 41 instances, 28 of which were "drowned cases." The remaining verdicts were various, and sometimes hypothetical, the practice followed being to dispense as much as possible with medical evidence, and never to fortify it with a post-mortern examination, if this can by any means be omitted. The Scotch plan of holding a preliminary investigation by a special expert before summoning a jury to make an Inquest would tend frequently to diminish charges on County Rates, and afford reliable statements of the actual cause of Death. We are most fortunate in possessing a suitable Mortuary, and have thus a great advantage over some more favoured parishes. Without one, the difficulties of repressing infectious disease, would, I think, be doubled, but our want of a disinfecting apparatus (owing to our having no available site) is to be regretted. For further details, vide Tables III, IV and V. METEOROLOGY. For the first three weeks the thermometer was higher than the average by 5 degrees. Then came a cold period, of the same duration, after which the temperature rose, and remained fur four weeks marking 7 degrees above its mean height. In the second quarter there was a great down-fall of rain with alternations of heat and cold : the rain-fall in this time was 13.2 inches (7.6 inches more than the average). This amount had not been exceeded previously since 1815. It was remarked, that on the same day in June, 3½ inches of rain fell in less than an hour at Camden Town, none at Kew, and only half an inch altogether at Greenwich. During the next quarter, the temperature varied greatly, as did the rain-fall, which in July was the least registered since 1815. In August, again, it was nearly as much as in the April quarter, and in 36 September, approached that of July. The temperature of the October quarter was very low, being after the first three weeks until Christmas, 5.6 degrees below the mean; and from Christmas to the New Year, 14 degrees higher than usual. In spite of these variations, the mean temperature and humidity of the year varied little, if any, from that of the previous 37 years. The average rainfall for a year (25.4 inches) was exceeded by 3.8 inches. GAS LIGHTING. Rotherhithe, being in this important branch of its municipal arrangements under the dominion of a company which is not under special obligatious to maintain a standard of purity as to ammonia and sulphur, and whose prescribed standard of illumination is below that of three others, is somewhat unfortunate. From numerous personal experiments, I can certify that from time to time a very injurious amount of impurities, especially sulphuretted hydrogen, is present in the gas supplied to us, and I venture to express a hope, that should any alteration of ownership or corporate power be contemplated by the Company, this point will not be lost sight of by you. WATER SUPPLY. A statement, still commonly made, that "Rotherhithe has the worst water in London" was probably true before your regular sittings as a Sanitary Authority, but is at present on a par with that as to the unhealthiness of the locality, which my predecessors and myself have each, in our Reports, so thoroughly refuted. Although the two supplies of water to this parish, from the Kent and Southwark Companies, are neither so good as is desirable, (both containing an objectionable excess of salts which could readily be removed at the works, prior to delivery), they are fairly wholesome, potable waters and far superior to much that is available for most country districts. The opinions of a well-known chemist on the "unfitness for dietetic purposes" of the Southwark water are not shared by several of his confreres, who, in addition to an equal scientific reputation, have, moreover, a trained knowledge of medicine; and my own analyses and observations of various drinking waters in London, the provinces, and abroad, justify me in accepting the views of the gentlemen referred to. Whilst thoroughly alive to the importance of procuring pure and soft water for cooking and drinking, I believe that Southwark water, as usually received from the mains, is practically so pure that a little care on our part is alone needed to convert an admittedly "safe second class water" into a "first class, pure soft water"; and will also suffice to remove any faults of imperfect filtration, should such be accidently present. Without going into the subject of the constant system, and the dangers of unclean butts and cisterns, especially when acting as ventilators for closets and sewers, I will show how this may be done. 37 In houses watered on the intermittent plan, all direct communications with drains closet-cisterns and dust-bins being removed, the capacity of the drinking cistern is to be calculated, and for every gallon it holds, 7 grains of slaked lime, if using Southwark Water, and 10 for the Kent Service, must be put into it, when full, and the supply temporarily checked. The lime will, of course, sink to the bottom, carrying with it the earthy salts (which constitute the "hardness") and the "organic pollutions," the clear water can then be drawn off as needed, and when all is expended, the cistern is cleaned out, refilled and recharged with the proper quantity of lime. Thames water from the main, thus treated, will prove almost equal in organic purity to the Kent as delivered, whilst both will he quite soft, and the organic matter removed will be left at the bottom of the cistern with the precipitated chalk. Many persons who have adopted this method at my suggestion, find it both workable and advantageous. For the constant system, the Porter-Clark plan is more suitable. Kent Water, though very free from organic contamination, is so hard (averaging 30 grains per gallon of earthy salts), as to be unsuited to many delicate persons and children, and it answers badly for cooking and washing.* In most streets of Rotherhithe a fair quantity of water is supplied throughout the year; but in some parts of Union Road, Gomm Road, round Jamaica Level, and notably on the Slipper Estate, there is a regular though short water famine in the summer and autumn, this is partly caused by waste from defective fittings, and partly by some receptacles on the intermittent system which are hardly adequate to the demands made on them in hot and dustv weather, though sufficient in cold and wet times; this evil was formerly brought under your notice, and not deemed sufficiently crying to necessitate your attacking it. SANITARY WORK FOR THE YEAR. A complete Report of this cannot be given, since I had not the honour of holding my present position as your Medical Officer before July 2nd, 1878; up to that date the duties were no doubt carried out to your satisfaction. On my election, I met with a large amount of general sickness, a few sporadic instances of Small-pox and Enteric Fever, and an outbreak of imported Typhus Fever, 4 cases of the latter occurring in succession in a house tenanted by two labouring families. I ascertained that some bedding on which typhus patients in Bermondsey had laid was subsequently used by these people. With the co-operation of Dr. Johnston, the District Medical Officer, each person attacked was removed to a special Hospital as soon as the illness was evident, and their bedding, &c., having been at once destroyed, the house was thoroughly disinfected, quarantined, and those next it carefully inspected. No further cases occurred either in it or the lane where it was situated. *See Table VII for some analyses I made of Southwark and Artesian well water from the rotherhithe chalk, shewing the superiority of the former, and also some reports on Sewer polluted waters from houses in which fatal contagious disease occurred, and on the average impurity of the air in our open spaces, 38 A well known piece of stagnant water "the Mill dam" was in a most offensive condition, being the receptacle for all the dead animals of its neighbourhood, having a deep deposit of mud in its bed, and eight of the adjacent houses emptying their privies into it. These were cut off and connected with the proper sewer, and the bed cleansed and asphalted by the respective proprietors. Two houses, both unfit for human habitation, were closed by your orders. About this time, we had a full share of summer diarrhoea, which was especially fatal to infants, and subsequently, of measles and whooping cough; but in every case where death occurred, a thorough inspection of the premises was made, and all possible steps taken when necessary for disinfection, house cleansing, removal of corpses to the mortuary, and improving defective house drainage and water supply. My attention was next directed, under the "Rivers Pollution Act, 1876," to the numerous privies and drains discharging into the Thames, and with your sanction preliminary steps were instituted for their removal. A horrible and dangerous nuisance, caused by a person named Judd collecting, to an enormous extent, fish refuse for manure-making in several arches of the South Eastern Railway (and mentioned by the Local Government Board Inspector in his first Report on Noxious Trades), was partially put down by your desiring vour Law Clerks and myself to procure a Magisterial Order for its removal and discontinuance. This was done, and as the manure maker refused compliance, he was again summoned, convicted, and in default of payment of penalties, imprisoned. I fear, however, we are not rid of him, as he still occupies the same premises, and collects garbage there, while many legal difficulties prevent prompt, and consequently, effectual action on the part of your officers. A stop, also by your direction, was put to some illegal cowkeeping and disobedience to noticcs for provision of proper drainage, by summons and fine of the offenders. At the usual period in the autumn, I inspected all the bakehouses and found them, with one exception (where at my request, after visiting the place, your Committee ordered important structural alterations), in the same cleanly condition which you have previously considered satisfactory. I next visited the cow-houses and slaughter-houses, prior to the annual renewal of their licenses, and on my report, you approved of them. The cowhouses, are, on the whole, more suitable for their purpose and better kept, than most I have seen near us. I wish I could speak as favourably of the Rotherhithe milk retailed, which in every instance of my analyses, I found adulterated with at least 25 per cent. of added water. The influence of this roguery on the health of the community is shewn by the child death-rate. In November, a solitary case of Typhus Fever in Elephant Lane, one of the poorest parts of the parish, proved fatal before it could be removed. 39 The corpse was directly placed in the Mortuary, the house disinfected after destruction of the patient's bedding and clothing, and no more persons were affected. Subsequently, we again had some small-pox, enteric fever, and scarlatina, but proper precautions being carefully adopted, and necessary revaccination sedulously urged and performed, our loss was small comparatively with that of other districts. The necessary expense incurred for removal to Hospital, disinfection, and compensation for destruction of infected articles, is proved to be well warranted; since that borne by another suburb which, suffering similarly in the same months, was not at first equally prompt in repressive action, was far greater. I have systematically noticed the various Manufactories and Granaries, and though • • several are not unfrequently a source of offence in their neighbourhoods, they are neither so noisome nor detrimental to health, as to compel me to ask you to interfere with them; and moreover, they have mostly prescriptive rights of usage. Some details of the usual Sanitary Routine are shewn in Table VI, compiled from the Reports to me made by Mr. Edwards, the Inspector of Nuisances, but it does not adequately represent all the work performed by your officers. The most important changes, so far as you are interested, in the Sanitary legislation of the year, are the Repeal of the "Bakehouse Regulation Act," (which is partially reproduced in the "Factory and Workshops Act, 1878" ) and the adoption of the "Canal Boats Act, 1877 and the "Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878." Time will shew how beneficial or otherwise these measures will prove, and in my next Annual Report I must draw your special attention to their working. I cannot but express my sense of the kindness, recognition, and support I have, since my appointment, received from the Vestry at large, and must record my obligations to my Colleagues your Law Clerks and Surveyors, for their cordial co-operation and valuable aid in the performance of my duty. I have the honour to be Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, BENJ n. BROWNING, M.D., S.Sc:C.Edin:, &c., Medical Officer of Health. Rotherhithe, 1879. 40 Table No. 1. Rotherhithe Sanitary District.
