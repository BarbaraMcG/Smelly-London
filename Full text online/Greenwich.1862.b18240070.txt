To the Greenwich District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I beg leave to lay before your Board the accompanying Tables, which I have carefully prepared to illustrate the mortality of your District during the past year, and wherein will also be found a statement of the number of Births, male and female, which have been registered during the 52 weeks ending the 28th of December, 1862. In Table No. 1 will be seen the number of Births and Deaths as they were registered in each succeeding month, and which, for facility of reference, I have subdivided into quarterly columns, and ultimately showing the total amount of Births and Deaths, the ages at which those Deaths took place, and the several Diseases causing those Deaths. In Table No. 2 will be seen the number of Deaths as they were registered in each month during the past year, throughout each division of the District. Table No. 3 will illustrate the comparative number of Deaths as they were registered in each division of the District during the past seven years;—and in Table No. 4 will be shown the Death-rate per 1000 of the population throughout the several divisions of the District, inclusive and exclusive of the Dreadnought Hospital, Greenwich Hospital, and the Union House. Table No. 5 refers to the Births as they were registered monthly throughout the year, with the total amount for the year in the several Parishes of the District. 7 Table No. 6 shows the comparative number of Births for the past seven years. Table No, 7 will be seen the excess of Births over Deaths for each separate division of the Division during the year 1862. These Tables in their general import agree very nearly with those of last year. The slight increase of Deaths over the preceding year, taking into consideration the increase of population since that period, would not be in excess of the average Death-rate per 1000 for the whole population of the District. On examining the Tables above alluded to, it will be seen that, whether referring to the number of Births and Deaths for the past three or four years, the ages at which those Deaths took place, or the Diseases causing those Deaths, there has not existed sufficient variation in their contents to call for any particular remarks on my part. In my former Reports I have examined with considerable minuteness all such subjects referring to the sanitary condition of the District as have been exhibited in the several Tables laid before you, and have offered the best suggestions in my power for the removal or prevention of such causes of Disease as the state of the District would appear to require; and were I now to make any comment on the Tables hereto annexed, I should be doing little otherwise than recapitulating the observations to which I have drawn your attention in my former Reports. The sanitary work performed by your officers, and under the direction of your Board, has been nearly in the same ratio as in preceding years. In addition to which I have great satisfaction in reminding you of the valuable arrangements issued by your Board in respect to the licensing of the numerous cowhouses in the District, a work of great sanitary importance, and worthy of your continued efforts to maintain them in the condition in which they have been placed by your directions. Another work of still greater sanitary importance, viz. the collection and removal of refuse and dust from the 8 houses and buildings in the District, has been for some time under the consideration of your Board; would that I could now report on the completion of that work throughout the entire District. The good effects which must arise to those Parishes wherein dust collectors have been already appointed, will, I trust, be a sufficient guarantee of the value of the remedy for the mitigation of diseases, and will be found to be a sufficient stimulus to urge the District Board to persevere in carrying out so praiseworthy a measure in the remaining part of the District. With the prospect of the complete drainage of the District, to which your attention has been now for some time directed, and by your continued efforts in promoting and adopting such sanitary measures as will appear to you to be conducive to the health of the District, I do trust, ere long, to be able to announce to you a great reduction in the Death-rate of the several Parishes under your charge, and more particularly as regards the infantile portion of the population. To infants under 5 years of age I must refer you for the great mortality of the District, numbering, as you will perceive by the annexed Tables, more than one-third of the entire mortality. With regard to that helpless portion of your population, therefore, I must exhort you to direct your efforts to the mitigation of the causes of preventable diseases, large powers for which have been granted you by the legislature of your country. With these remarks, and again thanking you for the support you have already given me in carrying into effect the many sanitary measures which I have already brought under your notice, I remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, HENRY N.

To the Greenwich District Board of Works. Gentlemen, Again, I have the honor of laying before you my Tabular Statement of the sanitary condition of your District for the year ending 26th December, 1863. Having compiled these Tables with great clearness and accuracy, I feel that the information contained in them will be best understood by your own careful perusal of the contents, and that any detailed description of them by me would be superfluous. I therefore beg most humbly to leave them to your attentive consideration. Table No. 1 will show the Births and Deaths for the past year, the ages at which Deaths took place, and the various Diseases causing those Deaths. Table No. 2 will show a comparative statement of the Births and Deaths for the past seven years, the ages at which those Deaths occurred, and the causes of those Deaths during the same periods. Table No. 3 will show the number of Deaths in each Division of the District as they occurred during each month throughout the year. 8 Table No. 4 will show the comparative number of Deaths occurring in each Division of the District during the past eight years. Table No. 5 will show the Death-rate per 1000 of the several Divisions of the District, inclusive and exclusive of the Hospitals and Union House. Table No. 6 will show the number of Births registered in each month throughout the several Divisions of the District during the past year. Table No. 7 will show the comparative number of Births throughout the several Divisions of the District during the past eight years. Table No. 8 will show the excess of Births over the Deaths during the past year. The sanitary work of your Officers has been of such a routine character that any further description of their labour for the past year would be merely a recapitulation of the operations which have been already before you. I have, therefore only to thank you for your support and co-operation in carrying out the numerous suggestions which have been submitted for your approval, and to subscribe myself, Your most obedient Servant, HENRY N.
