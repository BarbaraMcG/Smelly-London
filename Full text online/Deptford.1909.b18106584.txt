BIRTHS 3093 DEATHS (including 523 in Outlying Public Institutions) 1611 Excess of Births over Deaths 1482 NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. This Act was adopted by this Council during the year, and after the approval of the Local Government Board was obtained, came into operation in the Borough on 27th December, 1909. The following is a summary of the principal sections of the Act:—- Section 1 (l) Provides. In the case of every child born in an area in which this Act is adopted, it shall be the duty of the father of the child, if he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of its occurrence, and of any person in attendance upon the mother at the 6 time of, or within six hours after, the birth, to give notice in writing of the birth to the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the child is born, in manner provided by this section. (2) Provides, that notice shall be deemed to have been given under this section, by the posting of a prepaid communication, or the delivery of a written notice, to the Medical Officer of Health at his office or residence, within 36 hours after the birth has taken place. (3) Provides that any person who fails to give notice of a birth in accordance with this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding 20s. A person shall not be liable to a penalty under this provision if he shall satisfy the court that he had reasonable grounds to believe that notice had been duly given by some other person. (4) Provides, that the notice under this Act is in addition to, and not in substitution of, the usual registration of births. (5) Provides, that this Act shall apply to any child which has issued forth from its mother after the expiration of the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy, whether alive or dead. Up to the end of the year 46 births were notified. In consequence of the adoption of the above Act, it was necessary to appoint some officer to carry out its provisions and intentions. The Council therefore on the 15th June, 1909, decided to appoint a Lady Health Visitor, at a salary of £100 per annum. Advertisements were duly made, and from a list of 26 applicants Miss McCleverty, of Luton, was selected for the appointment, her name and qualifications being sent to the Local Government Board for approval before her formal appointment was made. Such approval had not been received at the close of the year. ZYMOTIC DISEASES.

Pulmonary Tuberculosis by the Medical Officer of a Poor Law Institution, and by the District Medical Officer in the case of any poor person he is attending, according to his agreement with the Board of Guardians. The notifications are to be made to the Medical Officer of Health within forty-eight hours after the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are first recognised. The Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution is required to post to the Medical Officer of Health a notification of the actual, or intended, place of destination of any person leaving the institution with respect of whom notification has been made, and the same obligation is laid upon the Relieving Officer in the case of persons not in an institution who may change their address. The Order is not to authorise anyone to put into force any enactment which renders the person notified or any other person liable to a penalty or subjects him to any restriction, prohibition or disability affecting him or his employment, occupation, means of livelihood, or residence, on the ground of his suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. The number of notifications received during the year was 538 relating to 172 cases. Table 3 shows there were 81 in North Deptford, 24 in South Deptford and 67 in Central Deptford.

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. The arrangement for the bacteriological examination and report upon doubtful cases, Diphtheria and Enteric Fever, was renewed by the Council with Clinical Research Association of Watergate House, Adelphi, W.C. The number of examinations made by them during the year ending 1st January, 1910, was 205; of these 190 were for Diphtheria, and 15 for Enteric Fever, the result being that 74 were found to be positive and 131 negative. At a cost of £38 4 0. 13 DISINFECTION. Disinfection is carried out at the New Disinfecting Station, Watson Street, by means of two machines of the Washington-Lyons pattern, in which all articles of clothing are disinfected. For such infected articles which would be injured by steam: leather goods, furs, boots, &c., are disinfected by formic aldehyde, volotised in an alformant-lamp in a specially constructed zinc-lined chamber. There are two vans employed, one used for collecting infected articles, and the other for returning them after disinfection is completed. With very few exceptions, all disinfection is carried out by the staff of the Council, and no charge is made. The number of rooms disinfected by the Council's staff during the year was 1,232. The number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c., disinfected being 7,696. Disinfecting fluid is supplied gratis where required. Disinfection of wearing apparel, &c., under the Midwives Act, was carried out in five cases. One hundred and four books belonging to the Council's Public Library, collected from houses where infectious diseases had occurred, were disinfected before being put back into circulation. Eleven premises consisting of fifteen rooms were fumigated during the year, under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, as being verminous. SCHOOLS CLOSED. The following school was closed during the year on account of infectious disease: Deptford Park, Boys' Department Scarlet Fever. During the closure the premises were thoroughly disinfected by the Council's staff. 14 THE SHELTER. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 60, Sub-Section 4, imposes on the Sanitary Authority the duty of making provision for the temporary housing of persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. The accommodation provided at the new premises in Watson Street consists of a detached building containing two separate and distinct tenements, each consisting of two bedrooms, kitchen, larder, bathroom, and w.c. Up to the end of the year there had been no occasion to use the shelter. MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. Register of Bodies Received into the Mortuary During the year ending January 1st, 1910. Total.

A summary of the sanitary work done during the year will be found in Table No. 27. The total number of premises inspected was 3,590, whilst re-inspections, calls, services of notices, etc., amounted to 11,882. The number of preliminary notices or "intimations" served during the year was 1,423, whilst the number of " statutory notices" served was 56, and in no case was it necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce these orders. Overcrowding was abated in 42 cases without having to take legal proceedings. Smoke Nuisances. During the year 14 observations were made, and in 8 cases where black smoke was emitted in such a quantity as to be a nuisance, notices were served to abate the nuisance. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The bylaws relating to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, made by the Council pursuant to Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 :— (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied. (b) For the registration of houses so let or occupied. (c) For the inspection of such houses. (d) For enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses. (e) For the cleansing and lime-washing at stated times of the premises. (f) For the taking of precautions in case of infectious disease. The number on the register is 273, the whole of which were regularly inspected with a view to seeing that they comply with the bylaws as regards cleanliness, overcrowding, etc. PREMISES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. These premises were kept under supervision during the year. The number of inspections was 157, relating to 111 premises and 236 rooms ; and include hotel kitchens, restaurant kitchens, coffee shops, eating houses, fried fish shops, eel pie shops, oyster bars, ham, beef d2 19 and pork cooking premises, sausage-making and meat-chopping premises, and any place where food is cooked or prepared for sale, or intended for human consumption. The number of premises added to the register during the year was 15, the removals therefrom numbering 10, leaving a total of 111 at the end of the year. Seventeen notices were served for various defects, and these, together with the usual notices for periodical cleansing, were readily complied with. The premises were found generally in a good condition, and the occupiers always ready to comply with any suggestion of the Inspector as to cleanliness or amendment of the premises. During the year two references were received regarding the reception of damaged grain from the S.S. Otaki, the cargo of which was damaged by a fire on board; but in each case the grain was not intended for human consumption, and a certificate was given by the owners to that effect in each case. BAKEHOUSES. The number on the register at the end of the year was 76, 73 as "workshops" and 3 as "factories." Two premises were closed during the year. Underground premises in use at the end of the year was 24, four being in disuse at the present time. Cleansing and Limewashing. The cleansing and limewashing was regularly carried out, and any defect, or insanitary condition discovered, was immediately attended to and remedied. The number of inspections was 239, and in only six cases was it necessary to serve written notices. No legal proceedings were found necessary. The bakehouses throughout the borough are kept in a satisfactory manner. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES AND OUT= WORKERS. These premises were kept under constant supervision during the year. Special attention was paid to the sanitary conveniences provided for the use of the persons employed. As stated last year the old practice of mixed accommodation, i.e. the same conveniences for the use of male and female workers has been entirely abolished, and the accommodation is now, not only separate, but the conveniences are kept in much better order and repair. 20 The usual register was kept posted up for the year. Factories. The number of factories on the register at the end of the year (including Bakehouses and Laundries) numbered 110, involving 252 rooms. Fifteen were added during the year and 4 removed, leaving on the register 8 Laundries, 3 Bakehouses, and 98 other Factories. 109 Inspections were made, and 21 written intimations served. Workshops. The number of Workshops on the register at the end of the year (including Laundries, Bakehouses and Domestic workshops) was 266 with 404 rooms. The number of Inspections was, Laundries 6, Bakehouses 231 ; other workshops (including domestic workshops) 167. The work carried on in the various workshops consisted, in addition to Bakehouses and Laundries, of Dressmaking, Millinery, Shirtmaking, Tailoring, and Smiths' and Wheelwright's work. Workplaces. The number of Workplaces on the register at the close of the year was (including Food premises) 167, with 302 rooms. Number of Inspections 169, 21 notices being served for the remedying of various defects. Premises include Stables, Builders' Yards, Restaurant Kitchens, &c. &c. Outworkers. The number of premises on the register at the close of the year was 475, using 479 rooms. The number cancelled during the year was 102, 114 being added. Number of Inspections 286, 6 notices being served for various defects. Lists received from employers numbered 86, showing 538 persons employed. The number of references received from other authorities was 355, and forwarded to other authorities 287. In three instances work was found in connection with infected premises and in each case the necessary disinfection of the materials was carried out before being returned to the employers. This work is of a varied and fluctuating character, and the outworkers complain very frequently of the small remuneration they receive, and often give up the work on that account, and so cause a continual alteration of the registers. 21 Special attention was paid to the condition of outworkers' rooms, and when necessary, cleansing was carried out. No legal proceedings were necessary during the year. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS AND PURVEYORS OF MILK. These premises were kept under constant supervision during the year. The number on the register at the end of the year 1908 was 200. During the year 48 were added and 49 cancelled, leaving 199 on the register. Inspections numbered 484, 13 notices being served. One prosecution was taken under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders for carrying on the business of a " purveyor of milk " without registration, and the offender was fined. The cleansing and limewashing of premises was enforced whereever found necessary, and in many cases, the use of defective or corroded cans and measures was prohibited. Forty-five were so dealt with during the year. Owing to the plea of ignorance advanced by persons as to the Orders and other Regulations with reference to the sale of milk, the following circular was printed and circulated. A copy was served by the Inspector on all registered persons, and one is handed to all persons applying for registration :— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF DEPTFORD. Public Health Department, Town Hall, New Cross Road, S.E. August, 1909. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops. Dear Sir (or Madam), I hereby direct your attention to the following provisions relating to the above :— Public Health (London) Act, 1891.

Section 69 of this Act provides :— A person who knows himself to be suffering from a dangerous infectious disease shall not milk any animal or pick fruit, and shall not engage in any occupation connected with food, or carry on any trade or business in such a manner as to be likely to spread the infectious disease, and if he does so he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Ten Pounds. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders. The regulations under the above orders provide:—- (25) Every Milk Store or Milk Shop, as well as all fixtures and tables contained therein, used in connection with the keeping or sale of Milk, shall at all times be kept in a cleanly condition. (26) All utensils and vessels used for the reception, storage or delivery of Milk shall be thoroughly cleansed with steam or scalding water as frequently as may be necessary for keeping such utensils and vessels perfectly sweet and clean, and only clean water shall be used for that purpose. (27) Every person, following the trade of dairyman or cowkeeper shall, at all times, employ such means and adopt such precautions as ma}' be necessary for keeping the utensils and vessels used by him for containing Milk in a clean and wholesome condition, so as to preserve the purity of such Milk. Regulations prescribing Precautions to be taken by Purveyors of Milk and Persons selling Milk by Retail, against Infection or Contamination:— (28) Every purveyor of Milk, or persons selling Milk by retail, shall immediately on any outbreak of infectious or contagious disease, within the building or upon the premises in which he keeps Milk, or amongst the persons employed in his business, give notice of such outbreak to the Board at their offices in Spring Gardens. (29) Every purveyor of Milk, or person selling Milk by retail, shall immediately on such outbreak coming to his knowledge, remove all Milk for sale and all utensils for containing Milk for sale from such building; and shall cease to keep Milk for sale or to sell Milk in such building until the same has been disinfected 23 and declared by the Medical Officer of Health for the district to be free from infection. (30) Every purveyor of Milk, or person selling Milk by retail, shall not keep Milk for sale in any place where it would be liable to become infected or contaminated by gases or effluvia arising from any sewers, gullies, drains, cesspools, or closets, or by any offensive effluvia from putrid or offensive substances, or by impure air, or by any offensive or deleterious gases or substances.

Penalties. If any person is guilty of an offence against the order of 1885, he shall for every such offence be liable to a penalty of Five Pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further penalty of Forty Shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Local Authority. Hknry W. Roberts, Miedical Officer of Health. * By the London Government Act of 1899 these powers are transferred to the Metropolitan Borough Councils. Infectious Cases. -Eleven cases of infectious disease occurred in connection with Dairy, Cowshed and Milkshop premises. In each case action was taken in accordance with the orders, the sale of milk, or contact with the premises, prohibited until after disinfection and certification of the premises by the Medical Officer of Health The cases were:—Scarlet Fever 9 cases. Diphtheria 1 „ Measles 1 „ 11 „ 24 ICE CREAM. These premises received special attention during the season of the year in which the business is carried on, and, where necessary, cleansing, etc., carried out. I am pleased to report that the reduction in the number of street vendors is maintained, very few street barrows being used in the borough. This is an advantage, as the practice is subject to many dangers, such as the repeated use of the glasses, etc. by different persons (and these principally children), without constant and efficient cleansing. Every effort is made to make the vendor carry a supply of clean water on the barrow, but the Italian itinerant vendor is not the most careful tradesman. The number of premises on the register at the close of the year was 132 ; 18 being added and 14 removed. These include (in addition to the Italian makers), Confectioners, Bakers and Sweets Sellers' premises. The number of Inspections was 197 ; 17 notices being served. One prosecution was taken during the year, viz.:—Breach of regulations in using a street barrow, without name and address therecn, and a fine of 10s. and 2s. costs was imposed. COWSHEDS. The following are the Cowsheds in the Borough at present licensed by the London County Council:— Weston, John, 178, 182 Grove Street 14 cows. Weston, J. & Sons, 33 Octavius Street 25 cows. Do. 211 Railway Arches, Edward Street 17 cows. Total 56 cows. The periodical cleansing and limewashing was regularly carried out in accordance with the bylaws. Number of Cowsheds in the Borough 3 Number of Cows allowed 56 Number of Inspections for the year 38 25 SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The following are the slaughter houses in the Borough at present licensed by the London County Council :— Wellbeloved, Alfred, 180 Brockley Road. Wellbeloved, William Henry, 13a High Street. Williams, William, Friendly Mews, Friendly Street. The premises were cleansed and limewashed every quarter as required by the bylaws. Number of slaughter houses in the Borough 3 Number of Inspections for the year 42 OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. There are still three premises in the Borough of offensive businesses under the offensive trade regulations of the London County Council, viz.:— Messrs. Wheen & Sons, Ltd., Copperas Street. Messrs. Hill & Sons, Ltd., 1 Frankham Street. Mr. Alfred Sharp, 6 Edward Street. Number of inspections during the year 38 I am pleased to report that these premises were very well conducted and very little complaint was received in regard thereto. CANAL BOATS.

In each case information was forwarded to the Local Education Authority for their attention. No cases of sickness have been found on board the boats during the year. The boats inspected were found clean, and in a satisfactory and habitable condition. The canal is still very little used. This borough is not a registration authority. The arrangements made for the inspection of boats are— Periodical inspection by Sanitary Inspector, duly appointed an inspector under the Canal Boats Acts jointly with other duties as Inspector of Workshops, Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops, etc. Name and address of Inspector—Thomas Turner, 161 St. Asaph" Road, Brockley, S.E.

THE SANITARY STAFF. As mentioned in my last Annual Report the Council approved of the vacancy in the staff being filled, and on 6th April Mr. Kemp, of Chelsea, was appointed Sanitary Inspector. Mr. Kemp commenced his duties on 1st May. I regret to report the death of J. Sales, one of the assistant disinfectors during the year. He was in the Council service some years, and was a very trustworthy man. F. Smith, a carman in the Council's employ, was appointed to fill the vacancy. E 2 27 I frequently visited the Disinfecting Station during the year and am pleased to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. I desire to express my appreciation of my staff who have so ably assisted me during the year. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen,' Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health.
