In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the following Report of their proceedings and an abstract of their accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during that time, and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year 1886. With a view to affording the ratepayers as complete a knowledge as possible of tho administration of parochial affairs generally, the Vestry have appended to their Report, Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians of tho Westminster Union, the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, and tho Trustees of Charitable Endowments iu which tho parish is interested. 14 THE PARISH. Extent. —The Parish occupies an area of 164 acres. It has about 12½ miles of streets, of which 3¼ miles are paved with wood, 2¼ with asphalte, 3¼ with pitching, 2¼ with macadam, and 1½ mile of courts, yards, and passages. Population.—At the last census, which was taken in April, 1881, the resident population was ascertained to be 29,865 persons, and the number of occupied houses 3,018. In this enumeration, however, no account is taken of the large number of persons who are engaged in the Parish during the day, and reside away from their places of business. Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on page 26. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union ; it is also a constituent part of the Central London Sick Asylum District. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been subdivided into five districts, the mother church beino; St. ' James's, Piccadilly, of which the Rev. J. E. Kempe, M.A., is Rector. Representation in Parliament.—The Parish of St. James was formerly comprised in the Parliamentary Borough of the City of Westminster, which returned two members to Parliament; it now however forms a part of the Borough of Strand, which returns one member, the present representative 15 being the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith. The Register prepared in I88fi contains the names of 4,409 electors, viz. 4 on the Scot and Lot List, 470 Lodgers, and 3,935 possessing other qualifications. There arc also 188 registered voters for the County of Middlesex in respect of property situate wholly or in part in the parish of St. James. by the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of the school Board for London. Five members of the School Hoard arc elected by the ratepayers of the Division. Water Supply.—Four companies supply the Parish with water, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being as follow:— 1. Chelsea Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 35, Commercial Road, Pimlico). So much of the Parish as lies to the south of the centre of Pall Mall and Cleveland How. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1722. 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.). So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running at the back of the east side of Poland Street, Lexington Street, Great Windmill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1619. 3. Grand Junction Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 65, South Molton Streets So much of the Parish as lira to the west of the district supplied by the New River Company and the north of the centre of Pall Mall. This Companv was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1811. 4. West Middlesex Waterworks Company (Chief Offices, 16 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as is situate within the Parish. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in the year 1806. The charges authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several above-mentioned Companies are almost identical, the scale being as follows:— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per centper annum; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent, per annum. An additional charge, varying from 4s. per annum where the annual value of the house exceeds £30 but is less than £50, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water-closet, fixed bath, or high service; for each additional water-closet, fixed bath, or high service, half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation of more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. Gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). The Coroner is Mr. Charles St. Clare Bedford, whose jurisdiction extends throughout the City and Liberties of Westminster. For the Registration of Births and Deaths the Parish is included in the Westminster District. The SubRegistrar is Mr. Thomas Matthew Crowe, of 31, Wardour Street; and the Superintendent Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond, Union Offices, Poland Street. 17 WARDS.

Word No. 4 (Goltlon Square)— All parts of the said Parish of Saint James, Westminster, not included in the Warts herain befors particularly described. c 2 20 ST. JAMES'S CHAPEL AND BURIAL GROUND. This Trust was brought to a close in August last, when the Vestry sanctioned the application by the Trustees of the balance then remaining in hand, as to £200 to the St. James's Dwellings Fund (see page 62), and as to the remainder, £79 18s. 2d., towards the expenses incidental to the transfer ofthe Derby Memorial Schools, Great Windmill Street, to the Managers of the St. James's National Schools. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. It appears from the Annual Report of the Commissioners which was presented to the Vestry in January, that an increased use has been made of both departments of this establishment. There were 2,785 more bathers, and 2,047 more washers during the year 1886 than during 1885, resulting in an increase of receipts to the extent of £86 18s. 1d. The Commissioners attribute this increase of business partly to the improvements which have been recently carried out. The following extract from the Report of the Commissioners will probably interest the parishioners generally:— Special attention has been paid to the sanitary arrangements of the building, the Commissioners having, from the commencement of the work, recognised the necessity of thoroughly overhauling the water-closets and drainage, in order to adapt them to modern requirements. The Commissioners were again compelled last year to ask for a sum of £1,000 from the Poor Rate. The building is, however, now in a state of substantial repair, and it is anticipated that no further call will be made upon the rates for some time, although the nature of the work involves an immense amount of wear and tear, and a considerable annual expenditure is required to carry out necessary repairs After payment of the instalment due early in January, the balance of loan outstanding will amount to £800 only. This sum is 21 being reduced at the rate of £200 a year, and the final payment will be made in January, 1891, so that unless any unfor??? contingency arises, the building will be free from debt in four years time, and the Parishioners will then be in possession of an unencumbered freehold building. The Vestry have assented to the payment of wages not exceeding 30s. a week to a man engaged by the Commissioners to do casual repairs. It is believed that the employment of a man constantly on the building will result in a considerable economy. The Vestry also assented to the application of the Commissioners for the sum of £1,000 from the Poor Rate. A vacancy among the Commisioners. occasioned by the death of Mr. Jeffs, was tilled up by the appointment of Mr. Pool. Two Commissioners retired by effluxion of time, in January, when Mr. Winnett was re-elected and Mr. James Lewis was elected. A list of the Commissioners is given on page 12, and a statement of their receipts and expenditure for the year 1886, and the number of bathers and washers, on page 116. ARCHBISHOP TEN ISDN'S SCHOOL Three of the Trustees of Archbishop Tenison's United Schools for the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Field and St. James are elected by the Vestry. A vacancy occurred during the year by the expiration of the term tor which Mr. Henry Graves had been elected, and was fi11ed up by the unanimous re-appointment of that gentleman. A statement of the accounts of the School for the year 1886 is given on page 120. BURLINGTON SCHOOL. This School is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in the year 1875, and two of the 22 Governors are elected by the Vestry. The vacancy caused by the death of Mr. T. H. Elam was filled by the election of Mr. F. H. Bingham. A statement of the Accounts of the School for the year 1886 is given on page 121. THE CRAVEN PEST-HOUSE CHARITY. Five Parishes participate in the benefits of this Charity, viz., St. Martin-in-the-Fields, St. George, Hanover Square, St. Clement Danes, St. Paul, Covent Garden, and St. James. Four of the Trustees are appointed on the nomination of the Vestry, the present representatives of the Parish being Mr. F. Crane, Mr. J. Bonthron, Mr. R. AY. Burgess and Mr. W. Winnett. The income of the Charity is applied, under an order of the Court of Chancery, to the maintenance of beds in King's College Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital, for the reception of poor patients from the five parishes mentioned. The hospitals are also required to afford out-treatment to all poor persons resident in any of the five parishes, who maybe sent by the Trustees. A copy of the Accounts of the Charity for the year 1886 is given on page 122. MRS. ANN NEWTON'S CHARITY. This Charity, for the apprenticing of one poor boy of St. James's annually from the Union School, is administered by the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1886 is given on page 125. 23 LE QUA INTER'S CHARITY. The only Charity which is administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter's. It arises from a bequest in 1782, by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly, who directed that the income should be "equally distributed at Christinas amongst twenty poor persons who are or have been housekeepers in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, and such as the Hector and Churchwardens, and the other gentlemen lor the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish, shall deem to be proper jects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." The property of the Charity at present consists of £9,969 2s. 9d. New Three per Cent. Annuities, but the Vestry are in communication with the Charity Commissioners on the subject of investing the Fund in some more remunerative manner, so as to increase the income of the Charity. A statement of the accounts for the past year is given on page 124 OTHER PAROCIAL CHARITIES. A list of other endowed Charities in which the Parish is interested is given on page 128 to 135 and statements of the accounts on pages 123 to 127. ANCIENT CHARITIES OF ST. MARTIN'S. In the month of September, the Vestry received a communication from the Charity Commissioners, stating that they had given careful consideration to the various suggestions made by the Vestry and other interested in the administra- 24 tion of these Charities, and had made certain alterations in the draft scheme, which, as so amended, had been now definitively established. It will be remembered that the two points to which the Vestry specially addressed themselves were the constitution of the new Governing Body, and the proportional representation thereon of the parish of St. James. To meet the objections which they entertained to the constitution of the Trust, as proposed, the Vestry suggested that co-optative Trustees should be altogether eliminated from the scheme, or, in the alternative, that their term of office should bo limited to the same period as that of representative Trustees, five years, instead of being made a life appointment. Upon examining the scheme as established, it was found that the principle of co-optative Trustees had been retained, but that the views of the Vestry had been met to some extent by the term of office of this class of Trustees being limited to eight years. The reason why the term of office of co-optative Trustees should differ from that of representative Trustees is not apparent, but the Vestry considered that an important step had been taken towards keeping the Governing Body in touch with modern ideas and requirements by the abolition of life trusteeships, other than the ex-officio trust of the Vicar of St. Martin's, and therefore did not further press their objection. Although the Vestry dissented in principle from the appointment of co-optative Trustees, they nominated Mr. Churchwarden Crane, of 55, Regent Street, as the first co-optative Trustee for this Parish, in the event of the Charity Commissioners deciding to appoint co-optative Trustees. It was therefore with some satisfaction that the Vestry learned that their nomination had been adopted, and Mr. Crane appointed accordingly. 25 With respect to the representation of the Parish of St. James upon the new Governing Body, the Commissioners increased the number of Trustees to be elected by the Vestry from one to two. This increase, however, was effected by the addition of one more Trustee to the total number, and not by reducing the number to be elected by the Churchwardens of the various Parishes interested, us suggested by the Vestry In accordance with the provisions of the Scheme, the Vestry elected two representative Trustees on the 21st October, the gentlemen so elected being Mr. Samuel Morle, of 102. Jermyn Street, and Mr. William Winnett, of 71 and 72. Wardour Street. It may not be out of place here to remark that the abovementioned Scheme for the future management of the ancient Charities of St. Martin's, arose out of the litigation between the Parishes of St. George, Hanover Square, and St. Martinin-the-Fields, to determine a claim by the former to a share in the income arising from the Conduit Mead Estate, which claim was fully established. The right of the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square, to share in this income was discovered by Mr. Churchwarden Crane in the course of his researches among the ancient records, and the successful termination of the litigation was to a large extent due to the painstaking care, rare skill, and energy with which Mr. Crane followed up the clue he bad discovered. The result of this litigation, affecting as it did the administration of one of the ancient endowments of the mother Parish, naturally led to an enquiry into the right- of the Parishes which had at various times been severed from St. Martin's to share in the Charities which bad there to fore been enjoyed by St. Martin's alone. This enquiry resulted in the establishment of the Scheme now under notice, and it may thus be said that it is entirely due to the research of Mr. Crane. and the ability and 26 energy he showed in prosecuting his enquiries, that the Parish of St. James has become enriched by a participation in the ancient Charities of the Mother Parish, St. Martin-in-theFields. The eminent services rendered by Mr. Crane in this matter were recognized by the Vestry on the 7th October, when a formal vote of thanks was unanimously passed, and a copy thereof ordered to be engrossed on vellum, given under the Common Seal of the Vestry, and presented to Mr. Crane. THE VESTRY, As constituted by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, consists of 48 elected and three ex-officio Members. It superseded an elected Vestry acting under the provisions of the statute 1 & 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers of St. James's on the 6th April, 1832. All the powers of the former Vestry and of the Paving Commissioners acting under Local Acts, as well as some of the functions of the Commissioners of Sewers, were transferred to the re-constituted Vestry. An Act was passed in the year 1858 relative to the main drainage of the Metropolis, by which the Vestry, as the rating authority of the Parish, were required to meet precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works for a Main Drainage Rate not to exceed 3d. in the pound per annum. In 1862 the powers of the Vestry were enlarged by the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act, and in the following year turnpike roads in the Metropolis were transferred from Commissioners, who had power to levy tolls upon horses and other animals and vehicles, to the Local Authorities, whose expenses are defrayed from the rates. 27 The Metropolitan Board of Works (Loan-) Act, 1869, and Money Acts of the Board, subsequently passed, besides making some alterations in the mode of assessing the expenses of the Board, have afforded increased facilities for the raising of money by Vestries and District Boards, of which the Vestry of St. James have availed themselves to a small extent. By the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879, the Vestry are empowered to purchase samples of food and drugs for analysis, to appoint a Public Analyst, and to prosecute vendors of adulterated articles. Proceeding- under these Acts during the past year are mentioned on page 71. The Vestry have also various powers under the Metropolitan Paving Act, 57 Geo. III., cap. 29, commonly known as Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, the Nuisances Removal Acts the Metropolitan Building Acts, the Metropolis Gas Act, the Sanitary Act, 1866, the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868, better known as Torrens' Act, and other statutes. There has been a growing tendency for some year- to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes, over the expenditure of which local authorities do not possess the slightest control. Thus, since the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855, the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main Drainage; (b) Fire Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges-purchase, maintenance, and rebuilding; (e) Artizans' Dwellings, and other purposes. A statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for Metropolitan purposes is given on page .37. STANDING ORDERS.

THE ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS Was held on Monday, the 10th day of May, the places appointed for the purpose being—Pall Mall Ward, Willis's Rooms, King Street ; Church Ward, Vestry Hall, Piccadilly; Golden Square Ward, National School House, Marshall Street ; and Great Marlborough Ward, Board Room, Poland Street. In order to give the greatest possible publicity to the matter, a postcard was sent to every ratepayer notifying the time and place for election, and as it was thought that the evening might prove more convenient to many ratepayers, the hour of election was fixed for seven o'clock in the evening, instead of at noon, as in former years. Notwithstanding this additional publicity, however, and the change of hour, the number of ratepayers attending the Elections did not exceed the attendance on previous occasions, and in two of the Wards was less than usual. A second election of one member was rendered necessary by the double return of Mr. Edwin William Parker for Church and Golden Square Wards. Mr. Parker electing to represent the former, an election to fill the vacancy in Golden Square Ward was held on the 21st of June, when Mr William Beszant was returned. 31 The total expense of conducting the election*, including the hire of rooms, publication of notices and a Poll in Great Marlborough Ward, amounted to £14 4s. 11d., and an older for payment of this sum from the Poor Rate was accordingly made by the Vestry in accordance with the Statute. A list of the Vestrymen and Auditor of Accounts will be found on pages 7 and 8. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The following is the number of meetings held during the year:— Vestry Meetings 44 Finance and House Committee 29 Sanitary, Parliamentary Bills, and General Purposes Committee 16 Works and Improvements Committee Lighting Committee 14 St. James's Dwellings Committee 15 Special and Sub-Committees Total 152 The Vestry usually meet on alternate Thursday mornings, but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of five members, and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Jour Standing Committees are appointed annually, in accordance with the byelaws of the Vestry, and meet as frequently as occasion may require. Special Committees are appointed from time to time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. 32 CHURCHWARDENS Were elected on the 29th day of April, when Mr. Frederick Crane, of 55, Regent Street, and Mr. William Cox, of 57, Pall Mall, were again chosen to fill this ancient office. SIDESMEN Were elected by the Vestry on the 29th day of April, the under-mentioned gentlemen being selected to fill the office:— Mr. James Thomas Robertson, 7, St. James's Street. Mr. Samuel Morle, 102, Jermyn Street. Mr. Robert Gurney Barclay, 69, Pall Mall. Mr. James MacMillan, 104, Jermyn Street. A vacancy occurred during the year, owing to the death of Mr. Barclay, but was not filled up. OVERSEERS OF THE POOR. Eight parishioners were nominated by the Vestry on the :29th day of April, to serve as Overseers of the Poor. The gentlemen chosen from this list, and appointed by the Justices of the Peace, at a Petty Sessions held on the 14th of May, to act as Overseers for the year 1885-6, were:— Mr. John Malin, 107, Jermyn Street. Mr. Frederick Jenkins, 4 and 5, St. James's Place. Mr. James Malin, 16 and 17, King Street, St. James's. Mr. Edward Colston Keevil, 113, Regent Street. 33 GOVERNORS AND DIRECTORS OF THE POOR. # In accordance with the requirements of the Local Act, 2 Geo. III., cap. 58, the Vestry met on the 29th April, for the purpose of appointing twenty-one "substantial and discreet" persons, either from their own body, or from among the Justices of the Peace for Middlesex or Westminster, or other "creditable inhabitants'' of the Parish, such persons, together with tho Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor, to be called Governors and Directors of the Poor. A list of the gentlemen so appointed is given on page II, and a statement of tho receipts and expenditure of the Board on page 118. REPRESENTATIVE AT THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. The period for which Mr. John Bonthron was elected, in succession to the late Mr. Elam, early in tho year, having expired, a meeting of the Vestry was held on the 10th June, for the purpose of electing a member of the Metropolitan Board of Works representing this Parish. The choice of the Vestry again fell upon Mr. Bonthron, who was unanimously re-elected for the ensuing three years. PREACHER AND ASSISTANT TO THE RECTOR. Tho Vestry received with regret an intimation of the death on November 16th, of the Rev. Reginald Dutton, M.A., who had held the appointment of Preacher and Assistant to the Rector not quite a year. Mr. Dutton was less than 30 years old at the time of his death, and although he had been engaged D 34 in the Parish a comparatively short time, he had gained the esteem of the congregation worshipping at the Parish Church, and gave evidence of more than average ability. The vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Dutton had not been filled up at Lady Day. CLERK IN ORDERS. A vacancy has occurred in this office, by the recent preferment of the Rev. Willis F. A. Lambert, M.A., to whose services the Rector bears warm testimony. OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. No change has occurred in the Official staff during the year, except the appointment of Mr. Lufkins as foreman of sweepers, in the place of Mr. Lewis, resigned. The salary of Mr. Munsey, first assistant clerk, has been increased from £120 to £135, and with that exception the salaries remain unaltered. A list of the officers of the Vestry, and their respective salaries, is given on page 108. FINANCIAL. It will be seen on reference to the accounts given on page 102, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurer's hands amounting to £13,578 4s. 8d. The sum of £82,416 9s.5d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period reached a total of £82,415 13s.8d.,leaving a balance of £13,579, 0s. 5d. on the 25th March, 1887. 35 Against this cash balance, however, there were on the lastmentioned date, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £10,952 11s. 7d., with assets (exclusive of cash balance) estimated to realise £1,275 4s. 8d., leaving a surplus of £3,901 13s 6d. to be carried to the credit of the present year. LOANS. A loan of £4,000 for paving works has been taken up during the past year; the money was borrowed from the Metropolitan Board of Works for a period of four years at interest at the rate of £3 10s. per cent. per annum. The Vestry contemplate borrowing a further sum of £6,000 for a period of five years, to defray the cost of paving the carriage-way of certain streets with asphalte during the year 1887. A statement of the loans now outstanding is given on page 112. RATEABLE VALUE. The assessment of the Parish, according to the valuation list which came into force on the 6th April, 1886, was as follows:— Gross Value £831,835 Rateable Value £694,201 Since the preparation of that list several properties have been taken down, and a few houses which have been re-built or altered have come into rating. The alterations in assessment thus made increase the totals of the Valuation List to the following amounts:— Gross Value £834,059 Rateable Value £696,061 D 2 36 RATES were made by the Vestry during the year as follows:— Amount in the Pound. Poor Rate (including, in addition to charges for the Relief of the Poor, Police, County, and Lunatic Rates, contributions to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges) s. 1 d. 9 General Rate for the lighting, maintenance, repairing and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, precepts of the School Board of London, and proportion of the Bridge Expenses of the Metropolitan Board of Works 1 5½ Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 0 1 Metropolitan Consolidated Rate, for meeting the precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works, so for as relates to the Fire Brigade, Main Drainage, Metropolitan Improvements, and general expenses of the Board 0 7½ Total 3 11 The rates for each of the two previous years were 3s. 10d. in the pound. The following statement shows the amount of the rates and the collection thereof:— Poor Rate — £ s. d. Amount of rate as levied 59,778 3 3 Arrears of former rates 976 9 0 Rates on property assessed during the year 502 2 2 61,256 14 5 Collected 58,500 15 10 Loss from empty houses, &c. 1,986 13 8 Arrears at close of year 769 4 11 61,256 14 5 Other Parochial Rates— Amount of rates as levied 74,011 1 2 Arrears of former rates 1,018 1 7 Rates on property assessed for the year 620 14 2 75,649 16 11 37  £ s. d. Collected 72,331 12 7 Loss from empty houses, Ac. 2,887 15 10 Arrears at close of year 980 8 6 75,649 16 11 Under the provisions of the Local Acts of Parliament relating to the Parish of St. James, the rates are made annually, but are recoverable by four quarterly instalments. For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. In view of the increasing demands by central Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry does not possessany control, although for economy in collection the funds are raised with the local rates, the following statement will be of interest to ratepayers:— Total amount expended, £147,449 7 4 Under Control of Local Autbority.

It will he seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £85,666 6s. 5d. of the total of £147,449 6s. 4d. having been paid over during the year to various authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. The efforts of the Vestry to reduce the rates by an economical administration in local affairs are thus to a large extent neutralised by the growing expenditure of Central Authorities. The following statement illustrates the enormous increase in the demands of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London during the last ten years:— 1877-8 1878-9 1879-80 1880-1 1881-2 1882-3 1883-4 1884-5 1885-6 1886-7 Metropolitan Board of Works 11,442 11,594 14,008 15,357 16,546 17,614 17,583 18,361 21,052 20,155 School Board for London 12,364 12,195 13,115 15,064 15,941 16,466 19,075 22,328 24,501 25,573 Total 23,806 23,789 27.123 30,421 32,487 34,080 36,658 40,689 45,553 45,728 39 The total amount raised with the local rates for these two Boards alone, during the ten years, is £340,334, being an average of £34,033 per annum. These precepts, which, in the year 1877-8, represented a rate of less than 9d. in the pound, had increased to a rate of more than 1s. 4d. in the pound in 1880-7, and in actual amount hare about doubled in ten years. The precepts for the year 1887-8 show an increase of £1,881 in the demand of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and a decrease of £l,245 in that of the School Board for London. COAL AND WINE DUES. The reply of Lord Randolph Churchill, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, to the deputation from the Corporation of the City of London and the Metropolitan Board of Works which waited on his lordship to solicit the aid of the Government in a proposed application to Parliament for the renewal of these Dues for a further period on their expiration in July, 1889, naturally attracted the attention of the Hating authorities of the Metropolis, In effect, his lordship condemned the dues as a tax on an article of first necessity, and as tending to encourage lavish expenditure, and stated that Her Majesty's Government could not he party to their renewal, although they might reconsider this decision it the people of London pronounced strongly in favour of a continuance of the dues. Any objections which might be taken to levying a duty on coal in aid of local rates, if such a proposal were made for the first time, are clearly subject to modification in view of the fact that a duty has been levied for upwards of two centuries, and therefore must have been taken into account by manufacturers and others in making existing arrangements. The 40 question consequently at once arises, who will benefit by the lapsing of the dues, and at whose expense will this benefit be gained? The Metropolitan Board of Works are committed to a large expenditure, and even if they do not undertake any further improvements, there is little hope of their annual expenditure decreasing to any appreciable extent for many years. The Wine Dues realise only a small sum annually, but the proportion of the Coal Dues applicable to the purposes of the Metropolitan Board of Works now produces about £340,000 per annum, which is equivalent to a rate (taking into account loss by empty houses and cost of collection) of between 3d. and 4d. in the pound. If the duty is not renewed, no other source of income is likely to present itself, except an addition to the rates. The lapsing of the Coal Dues would therefore lead to a shifting of local burdens which is well worthy of consideration. Speaking broadly, local rates are levied only on houses and land, and the amount of rent which a man pays, especially for business premises, does not necessarily represent his means as compared with his neighbours ; still less does it necessarily bear any ratio to his coal bill. The transfer of a charge of £340,000 a year from the coal consumer to the ratepayer is therefore much more than a matter of account. It is, of course, an open question to what extent the coal consumer would benefit by a remission of the duty, but even supposing him to derive the full benefit, and the retail price of coals to be reduced by 1s. 1d. per ton, a very slight consideration will show that to the large mass of ratepayers the diminution in their coal bill would be more than counterbalanced by the increased demand of the rate collector. This would be especially the case with the small consumer, even if his name does not appear in the rate book. Rents of rooms are 41 sumably fixed with some regard to the total outgoings in respect of the whole house. An increase in the rates of even 3d. or 4d. in the pound in one parish alone might not lead to a rise in the rent of weekly properties, because a lower rent would still prevail in adjoining districts, and competition would operate. But tho case is altogether different if such an increase in the rates extends over the whole Metropolis. Landlords are not likely to assent to a diminution of income, even if the tendency of all taxation were not to fall upon the ultimate consumer, in this instance the occupier of one room or more. Assuming tho additional rent to be but 3d. a week, and a smaller increase can scarcely be anticipated, the tenant would have to be a consumer of coal to the extent of 12 tons a year to balance this extra rent. Such a consumption by the occupier of one or two rooms is, of course, altogether out of tho question, Again, the occupier of premises rented at £80 a year would be called upon to pay additional rates amounting to upwards of £1 a year, which represents the duty on about 18 tons of coals. But in how many cases does the occupier of premises worth £80 a year consume anything approaching such a quantity of coal per annum? These two instances are sufficient to show that neither the working nor ordinary trading classes—which together form the bulk of the population of London—have any interest in tho remission of the dues. The Gas and Water Companies would probably gain by the change, on account of the amount they contribute in the form of coal dues being more than they would have to pay if the rates were increased to replace the dues. The consumer of gas might derive some advantage, although the Chairman of the Gas Light and Coke Company recently declared that the amount of the dues is not large enough, in itself, to affect the price of gas; but it must be remembered that iu the year 42 1876, an initial or standard price of gas was fixed, entitling the shareholders to a larger dividend with every reduction in the price of gas. The utmost benefit which the gas consumer could gain would therefore be half the amount now paid by the Companies in the form of coal dues, and the remainder would reach the pockets of the shareholders at the expense of the ratepayers. Any gain which the Water Companies might reap would go entirely to the shareholders, with the result that the capital value of their undertakings would increase. In the event of these undertakings being subsequently acquired by a public authority, the ratepayers would have to pay increased compensation merely because the Water Companies had in the meantime divided larger profits, a portion of these profits representing the saving to the Companies, by the remission of the coal dues, again at the expense of the ratepayers. Having regard to all these considerations, and to the many additional charges thrown by Parliament upon local rates of late years (see page 27), the Vestry memorialized the Government to reconsider their determination, and asked the Member of Parliament for the district (the Right Hon. W. H. Smith) to support the continuance of the dues. INHABITED HOUSE DUTY. The attention of the Vestry having been drawn to certain anomalies in the incidence of the Inhabited House Duty, the subject was referred to a Committee for consideration, and upon their report, a communication was addressed to the Board of Inland Revenue with a view to the Duty beingassessed in accordance with the spirit of the Acts relating thereto. The Board in their reply did not hold out any hope of a general removal of the anomalies referred to, although 43 they expressed their willingness to consider any specified case. The Vestry therefore determined to seek the co-operation of other local authorities in bringing the subject under the notice of the Chancellor of the Exchequer by deputation. The levying of Inhabited House Duty is not, strictly speaking, a Vestry matter, hut as the anomalies referred to affect a large proportion of the parishioners, the Vestry felt fully justified in taking cognizance of tho subject. It is believed that, through ignorance of the law, many ratepayers submit to an excessive impost of the Duty, which might be remedied by laying a statement of facts in each case before the Surveyor of Taxes. Broadly speaking, shops with dwelling houses attached are assessed at 6d. in the pound, and private houses at 9d., while premises used exclusively as offices or for business purposes are exempt altogether. In order, however, to bring a shop and dwelling house under the sixpenny duty, the business must be carried on by the person liable to the duty. Again, solicitors, milliners, dressmakers, &c., who use part of a private house for business purposes, are assessed at 9d.; lodging-house keepers are also charged 9d., while private hotel keepers are assessed at 6d. These are some instances of the anomalies in question. For the information of such of the parishioners as may be concerned, the following extracts are given from the Act of Parliament, 41 Vic., cap. 16, sec. 13:— Where any house, being one property, shall be divided into and let in different tenements, and any of such tenements are occupied solely for the purposes of any trade or business, or of any profession or calling by which the occupier seeks a livelihood or profit, or are unoccupied, the person chargeable as occupier of the house shall bo at liberty to give notice in writing, at any time during the year of assessment, to the Surveyor of Taxes for the Parish or place in which the house 44 is situate, stating therein the facts; and after the receipt of such notice by the Surveyor, the Commissioners acting in the execution of the Acts relating to the inhabited house duties shall, upon proof of the facts to their satisfaction, grant relief from the amount of duty charged in the assessment, so as toconfine the same to the duty on the value, according to which the house should, in their opinion, have been assessed, if it had been a house comprising only the tenements other than such as are occupied as aforesaid, or are unoccupied. Every house or tenement which is occupied solely for the purposed of any trade or business, or of any profession or calling by which the occupier seeks a livelihood or profit, shall be exempted from the duties by tbe said Commissioners upon proof of the facts to their satisfaction, and this exemption shall take effect, although a servant or other person may dwell in such house or tenement for the protection thereof. By the 24th section of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881, the term "servant" in the preceding section is to be taken as meaning, and including, only a menial or domestic servant employed by the occupier, and the expression "other person," is to be deemed to mean any person of a similar grade or description, not otherwise employed by the occupier who shall be engaged by him, to dwell in the house or tenement, solely for the protection thereof. Careful attention to the foregoing provisions will enable many parishioners to claim exemption, either wholly or partially, to a considerable extent. The anomaly, however, of placing boarding-house and lodging-houses keepers in a different category to private hotel keepers can only be removed by legislation. The Vestry readily granted the use of the Vestry Hall for a meeting of Ratepayers, with a view to concerted action beingtaken for the purpose of placing the assesssment to Inhabited House Duty on a more satisfactory footing. 45 INCREASING COST OF NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. Upon receiving a letter from the Vestry of St. Mary-leStrand suggesting a diminution in the number of Civil Servants of the Crown, or a reduction in their salaries with a view to relieving the taxpayers of a portion of their continually increasing burden, the Vestry resolved to ask the lit. Hon. W.H. Smith, M.P, to move for a Parliamentary enquiry into the matter, the question of pensions to be included in the scope of such enquiry. Shortly afterwards the Chancellor of the Exchequer intimated the appointment of a Royal Commission to enquire into the whole subject. VESTRY PROPERTY. Vestry Hall.—No repairs of importance have been rerequired during tho year. Stables and Stoneyard.—The Vestry having decided to purchase a third horse, the stabler were entirely reconstructed, and advantage was taken of the occasion to make considerable alterations to the stone yard, with a view to economising space, and the better protection of the stores. The work was carried out under the direction of the Surveyor, at a cost of £184 9s. 3d. Disinfector.—The Disinfector has been used for disinfecting bedding, clothing, &c., for parishioners on 25 oocasions, compared with 36 occasion* in 1885-6, and 93 in 1884-5. 46 Mortuary.—The bodies of 49 persons have been received into the Mortuary during the year, as compared with 32 during the previous twelve months. Medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others who are specially brought into contact with the poor, are invited to assist the Vestry in preventing the spread of disease which may arise from the retention of a corpse in a room occupied perhaps by a number of people in a thickly-populated neighbourhood, by making known, as occasion requires, the provision made for the reception of bodies in a decent manner and with all possible deference to the natural feelings of the bereaved relatives. As the main object of providing a Mortuary and Disinfecting Apparatus is to protect the parishioners at large against the spread of infectious disease, either may be used without charge. Information as to the mode of proceeding in such a case may be freely obtained at the Vestry Hall. OTHER PARISH PROPERTY. Eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street were purchased in the year 1819, for Parochial purposes. Two of the houses are now absorbed into the Workhouse premises, and the site of three others has been utilized for the erection of the Public Baths and Wash-houses. The remaining six houses are let on repairing agreements, and realize a rent of £295 per annum, which, together with the sum receivable from the Westminster Union in respect of that portion of the Workhouse premises belonging to the Parish of St. James, is applied in aid of the Poor Rate. 47 SCAVENGING, DUST REMOVAL, &c. The cost of Scavenging and Dust Removal last year, as appears by the Accounts, exhibits an increase of no loss than £1, 190 1s. 8d., compared with the expenditure for the previous year. This increase is mainly duo to the higher contracts which the Vestry were compelled to accept last year, but some addition was made to the amount by the experimental cleansing of all the streets in the Parish after midnight on Saturday weekly during the summer months; this work cost £137 7s. 4d. With a view to expedite the work of cleansing generally, and to enable the streets to be swept a second time in the day in exceptionally bad weather, a third sweeping machine and horse have been purchased. When not required for scavenging purposes, tho Vestry's horses are put to general work, thus reducing tho cost of horse hire for street watering and carting. Sixteen orderly bins have been fixed at various refuges to receive the horse-droppings collected by the boys. In anticipation of the expiration at Lady-day of the contract for street watering entered into in 1884, the Vestrv invited tenders by public advertisement, and that of Messrs. W. Mead & Co., of Paddington, was accepted at a schedule of prices. The contract will run for a period of three years from Lady-day, 1887, terminable, on notice, at the end of the first or second year at the option of the Vestry. The following is a statement of the number of loads reported to have been removed from the parish during the year:— ] Cart Loads Wagon Loads. Dust 3.213 2,061 Slop 505 5.242 The cost of Street Watering last year was £902 4s. 11d. or £5 8s. 6d. less than in 1885-6. 48 REMOVAL OF SNOW. In anticipation of a possible heavy snowfall, the Vestry early in the winter sought and obtained the consent of the Thames Conservators and the Metropolitan Board of Works, to the casting of clean snow over the parapet of the Victoria Embankment into the river. Conditions were attached to the consent with a view to preventing damage to the embankment wall or the impeding of traffic on the river. A heavy snowstorm occurred on the night of December 26th, and although some difficulty arose in obtaining a sufficient number of extra men at the start, owing to the holiday season, all the main streets were rendered fit for traffic by midday on the 28th, and the whole of the thoroughfares were cleared by the 31st. The work of removal was considerably expedited -and the cost lessened, by the casting of the snow into the river. The adoption of this course moreover prevented the necessity of temporarily stacking snow in the squares and open spaces in the Parish, as was done in January, 1886. The following is a statement of the extra men, horses, and carts, employed in clearing the streets and removing the snow:— Men. Horses & Carts. December 26th (night) 7 - 27th 111 7½ days work. ,, 27 th (night) 61 ,, 28th 68 13 ,, 29th 84 10 ,, 30th 127 10 ,, 31st 101 559 40½ 49 Extra labour cost £128 16s. 5d., carting £19 4s. 9d., and salt £20, making a total additional outlay of £168 1s 2d. The ordinary staff of scavengers and an unusually large number of carts and waggons belonging to the Contractor were also employed almost exclusively in dealing with the snow for the first four days of the week. It may be remarked that on the occasion under notice, the streets were cleared far more rapidly than last year, although the depth of snow was probably fully as great, In fact only two complaints of delay were received, the complaint in each case being from a resident in the squares, which were purposely left until the last, in order that the through traffic might bo assisted with the least possible delay. With a view to still further reducing the interruption to traffic arising from snowfalls, the Vestry have Authorised the Surveyor to construct one or two snow-ploughs and to obtain two horse-rakes. The latter will also be available for use for scavenging. CONTRACTS FOR WORKS AND MATERIALS. The Contracts entered into in 1884 for a period of three years being about to expire, the Vestry invited tenders in February by public advertisement. Particulars of the contracts now in force are given on page 113. In each case the contract, as before, is tor three years, terminable, on notice, at the expiration of the first or second year, at the option of the Vestry. STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1886, there were 728 public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, 70 which were 50 ordinary street lamps (485 burning cannel gas, and 218 burning common gas), 4 were urinal lamps, and 21 were larger lamps attached to refuges. On the 25th March, 1887, the number of lamps was 771, showing an increase of 43 in the twelve months; the proportion of different lamps is now 458 cannel gas street lamps, 286 common gas street lamps, 4 urinal lamps, and 23 refuge lamps. The ordinary street lamps are lighted, extinguished, cleaned, and maintained by the Gas Company under an arrangement with the Vestry ; the agreed sum is £2 8s. 4d. per annum each either for cannel or common gas, 2½ft. of cannel gas being supplied per lamp per hour, and 3ft. of common gas. Larger street lamps are charged for at a proportionate price, but as regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total cost of street lighting for the past year amounted to £2,433 12s. 9d., as compared with £2,295 8s. 8d. for the previous twelve months. This sum is exclusive of new lamp-posts, lanterns and fittings, which cost a further sum of £265 10s. 9d. It will be seen from the above figures that a considerable addition has been made to the number of lamps, necessarily accompanied by some increase in the cost. This increased expenditure is entirely due to the extra lamps erected at Piccadilly Circus and in Shaftesbury Avenue, and represents a portion of the annual cost to the parishioners of the Piccadilly Improvement, which was carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works. The increased cost of street lighting, however, is considerably less than proportionate with the additional number of lamps taken into lighting, owing to an economy which has been effected by a re-arrangement of the hours of lighting. The ordinary street 51 lamps are now kept alight 3,940 hours per annum instead of 4,300 as formerly, and the light in tho metered lamps is reduced to a consumption of 5ft. of gas per hour at midnight, instead of the full light being continued the whole night. The economy in gas arising from this re-arrangement represents nearly £250 per annum, against which is to bo set off the wages of the lamplighter employed by the Vestry to attend to the refuge lamps (rendered necessary by the new arrangement), amounting to £65, leaving a nett saving of about £185 a year. This saving is, however, more than absorbed by tho cost of the additional lamps already referred to. A resolution to adopt the average meter system for tho ordinary street lamps (i.e., to affix a meter to every twentieth lamp, and calculate tho consumption of gas in all the street lamps, whether metered or not, upon the average of such meters) was passed on tho 15th July, but the operation thereof was suspended for twelve months, in order that the modification of hours under arrangement with the Company might bo put to a practical test. Early in the year tenders were invited for new lanterns for tho lamp-posts in Regent Street, and tho tender of Messrs. Verity Brothers, of 137, Regent Street, to supply and fix about eighty 16in. lanterns, of copper frame and with opal top, at 37s. each, was accepted. The size of tho flame in tho Regent Street lamps was largely increased early in 1886, and the substitution of new lanterns for the old heavy lanterns has further considerably improved tho lighting of the street. Advantage has been taken of tho fixing of new lanterns to insert the names of streets in the lamps at street comers. Now lanterns, or burners of a larger size, have been fixed in Arundell Street, Cleveland Row, Walker's Court, Pall Mall (east end), Lexington Street, Little Crown Court, Waterloo 52 Place, Great Windmill Street, and a few other places. A bracket lamp fixed to No. 10, Archer Street, by Messrs. Newman and Co., has been taken to by the Vestry, and is now lighted at the expense of the Parish. Permission has also been given for the erection of a lamp-post and lantern in Regent Street, at the end of Foubert's Place, by the Minister and Deacons of Craven Chapel, on condition that the lamp is lighted, extinguished, and cleaned at the same time as the public lamps, at the cost of the Chapel authorities. PRICE OF GAS. In the month of November the Vestry received from the Strand District Board of Works a communication calling attention to the difference in the price charged for gas by the Companies supplying the northern and southern districts of the Metropolis respectively, and suggesting that the Vestry should join in asking the Metropolitan Board of Works to initiate legislation providing for a uniform price throughout the Metropolis. The subject having been carefully considered, the Vestry replied that, in view of the legislation of 1876, which regulates the price of gas upon a sliding scale, the standard or initial price being higher in the district north of the Thames than in that south of the river, they were not prepared to assist in re-opening the question at the present time, especially as this legislation was preceded by enquiry, but that in the event of the Coal Dues not being renewed after July, 1889, they would feel it their duty to call the serious attention of the Government to the matter, with a view to the settlement of 1876 being reconsidered. Notice has been received from the Gas Light and Coke Company of their intention to reduce the price of gas for 53 public lighting by 1d. per cubic foot, common gas to 2s. 5d. per 1,000 feet, and cannel gas to 3s. The price to private consumers will remain unaltered. The difference in the price of gas for public lighting and to private consumers arises from tho Gas Light and Coke Company being required by law to charge, for public purposes, the same price as is charged to private consumers in tho District of the South Metropolitan Gas Company, even although their profits may not be sufficient to warrant a general reduction in price. PRIVATE LAMPS. The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of Private Lamps, except upon the following conditions:— 1. That no part of pueh Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside of the kerb bounding the footway. 3. That all such Lamps shall bo entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such cases as Medical Men, Post Office, Sweeps, fire Engine, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency. 4. That no such Lamps shall he suspended by ball and socket-joint only. 5. That no Lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed Lamps, with their dimension*. and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval 54 ELECTRIC LIGHTING. No progress has been made towards lighting this Parish with electricity. The Bill promoted by the West London Electric Lighting Company, which was noticed in the last Annual Report of the Vestry, was withdrawn. Three Bills for the Amendment of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, were introduced into the House of Lords and referred to a Select Committee, but did not pass beyond that stage. Notice was received in the month of June of the intention of the West London Electric Lighting Company to apply for a further Provisional Order in the ensuing session, but this notice has not been followed up. The Board of Trade intimated their intention, in the month of November, to revoke the Order granted to the West London Electric Company in 1884, in consequence of the undertakers having failed to show to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade, within the prescribed time, that they were in a position fully and efficiently to carry out the obligations imposed upon them. This Order having been accordingly revoked, the Vestry are now free to entertain proposals for the lighting of the Parish, or any portion thereof, bv electricity. NAMES OF STREETS. Three Orders have been made by the Metropolitan Board of Works for re-numbering houses in streets in this Parish:— New name. Names abolished. No.of houses renumbered. Ganton Street. South Street. Cross Street. 26 Heddon Street. Heddon Court. 29 Warwick Street. Great Vine Street. 11 55 STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford Street which is situate in the Parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The cost of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion of the thoroughfare is ascertained annually and paid by the Vestry. By an Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the following thoroughfares are placed under the exclusive management of the Vestries of St. James and St George, Hanover Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, instead of according to the actual Parish Boundary, viz:—Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St. James's Street, and Park Place. No payment is made by either Vestry to the other under this Order, the exchange of area being regarded as an equivalent. An ordor was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21st December, 1883, placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Meard's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes of cleansing and maintenance and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for tho same purposes, of the Strand District Board. An arrangement made some years since with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street as regards the cleansing and paving, in consequence of the boundary line being somewhat irregular, is still in force. 56 PAYING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. Particulars of these works are given in the Surveyor's Report, commencing on page 89. It will be seen that a small quantity of wood paving and a larger quantity of asphalte have been laid during the year. The most extensive repair carried out was the relaying of the wood paving in Pall Mall It is contemplated to further extend the area of asphaltepaved carriageways during the ensuing year, mainly for sanitary reasons. It is also proposed to relay the wood pavement in Regent Street and Piccadilly at the close of the present London season, and to take advantage of the opportunity to increase the number of refuges in those streets. USE OF STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The conference on this subject, to which allusion was made in the last Annual Report, resulted in a determination to apply to the Metropolitan Board of Works to introduce a clause into a Bill in Parliament with a view to amend the law with regard to the laying of pipes and mains in streets, and the use of steam rollers on carriageways. It was further resolved to approach the Metropolitan Board of Works with a memorial to be presented by a deputation from as many of the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards as cared to be represented. By far the larger portion of the carriageways in this Parish are paved with wood, asphalte, or pitching, consequently restrictions on the use of the steam road roller do not very materially affect the Vestry, but underlying the smaller question is the important principle of securing to local authorities due control of the streets which are placed under 57 their charge for maintenance and repair. The Vestry accordingly requested two of their members to join the proposed deputation. A memorial was in due course presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and a clause dealing with the question to some extent was inserted in a Bill which is being promoted by the Board in the present session. REFUGES. The following is a list of Refuges in the Parish:— Haymarket, South end, Pall Mall, by the United Service Club. ,, by the Athenæun Club. „ by St. James's Palace. „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly, by St. James's Street. „ by Burlington House. ,, by Piccadilly Circus. „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly Circus (2 Refuges).

Waterloo Place, between the Athenæum and United Service Clube „ „ North of Crimean Statue. 58 CONSTRUCTION OF VAULTS. The following regulations have been made in regard to the construction of vaults under footways:— 1. That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation of such plan as sanctioned be made during the execution of the work, without the consent of the VeBtry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, or nine inches thick. 4. That the space from the upper eurface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line of kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. SANITARY. It will be seen on reference to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 139, and the appendices thereto, that continuous attention has been paid to the abatement and removal of nuisances. It is impossible, however, to convey any accurate idea of the extent or value of sanitary work by the mere tabulation of figures. The most satisfactory proof of the value of this department of the Vestry's work is afforded by the reduction in the rate of mortality in the Parish since the creation of a sanitary department some thirty years since. Without here further entering into details, it may be remarked that the Medical Officer of Health reports that the 59 death rate of the Parish was 15.07 per 1,000 for the year 1886, as compared with a rate of 21.6 for the whole Metropolis. Only 14 cases of smallpox, diptheria, and various kinds of fever, are known to have occurred in the Parish, and but 2 deaths are attributable to this class of disease. Two officers have been constantly engaged in the work of inspection with a view to detecting and removing nuisances, but the Vestry are still more anxious to prevent unsanitary conditions which give rise to nuisances. With this object they once more appeal to the parishioners for intelligent co-operation, especially to such as by their avocations are brought into contact with residents in the poorer and more crowded districts. The Vestry will be glad at all times to receive early information of any nuisance or supposed nuisance. It is not absolutely necessary that the name and address of the informant should be given in all cases, although it is very desirable that this should be done where possible, in order to save loss of time in fruitless inquiry. Another and most valuable mode of assisting in maintaining a high degree of public health is for each householder to insist upon scrupulous cleanliness being observed in the premises under his control. Where cisterns are in use they should be kept covered and flushed out at sufficiently frequent intervals; if they are used as receptacles for drinking water, they should be disconnected from water closets and drains; care should be taken to keep the drains clean and properly trapped; attention should be paid to the ventilation of dwelling rooms; and no foul accumulation should be permitted to remain in the dust bin. Information and advice on all these subjects, and on any other points relating to the public health or sanitary precautions, may be freely obtained 60 at the Vestry Hall. It cannot be too earnestly urged that the neglect of sanitary measures in a small area, perhaps in a single house, may lead to a serious and widespread epidemic. The Vestry have therefore no hesitation in saying that a timely intimation to their Medical Officer of Health may prevent very serious consequences and actual loss of life. DUST REMOVAL. During the year, the Vestry called the attention of nonresident owners of houses let in tenements to the necessity of their making some arrangement to secure the removal of refuse at stated intervals, or as often as occasion may require. It frequently occurs that, in consequence of no person on the premises being authorised by the owner to see that the dust bin is emptied, the refuse is allowed to accumulate until the receptacle is filled beyond its capacity, with the result that heavy rain washes grit, cinders, &c., into the drain in the yard or area and causes a stoppage. Decaying matter, moreover, instead of being burned, is often placed in the dustbin, and the accumulation thus becomes a source of danger to health. In the interests alike of their tenants, as affecting health and comfort, and of their own property, owners of tenement houses are therefore strongly advised to authorise one particular tenant in each house to see that the dustbin is periodically cleared, and to hold such tenant responsible for any neglect in respect thereof. Houses occupied by more than one family may be registered under the Sanitary Act, 1866, and in the case of houses so registered, the owner is liable to a penalty of 20s. for every day during which the dust receptacle is not maintained in a wholesome state. 61 COWSHEDS, DAIRIES, AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. There are now no cowsheds in the Parish, and only two slaughter houses. The licences of the Utter were renewed in October, the premises having been kept in a satisfactoty condition. DISINFECTION OF CABS. In the event of a public conveyance being used for conveying any person suffering from any dangerous infections disorder, the owner or driver thereof is liable under the Sanitary Act, 1866, to a penalty of £5, unless he immediately provides for the disinfection of his vehicle. Since the general adoption of a system of ambulance-service by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and other Authoring, he use of an ordinary public conveyance for removing an infectious patient to hospital has become exceedingly rare. The attention of the Commissioner of Police, however, had been directed to the enactment referred to, and he enquired whether the Vestry would undertake the disinfection of cabs under such circumstances, and if so, for what charge, and whether a certificate of disinfection would he given. The Vestry replied that in their judgment the only means of ensuring the public from risk of infection in such a case is for the conveyance to be disinfected before permitted to leave the hospital premises which is in fact the practice prevailing at the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. where the large majority of infections case are received. METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. On the 2nd December, the Vestry passed a resolution expressing their concurrence in the opinion of the Chelsea 62 Board of Guardians to the effect that it is desirable that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should issue a report annually, and that such report should be given in sufficient detail to admit of comparison in the cost and results of administration in the various hospitals under the charge of the Board. Thisresolution was communicated to the Board and duly acknowledged. The Vestry thereupon requested the Board to furnish them from time to time with a printed copy of their accounts, and this request has been complied with. REGISTERED HOUSES. It is satisfactory to note that the tenement houses registered under tho sanitary regulations of the Vestry have not occasioned any special trouble during the year. ST. JAMES'S DWELLINGS. It was stated in the last Annual Report of the Vestry that a number of firms had been invited to tender for the erection of the proposed Dwellings, according to the designs of Mr. H. H. Collins. Each of the firms so invited submitted a tender, but upon the tenders being opened the amounts were so largely in excess of the original estimate of the Architect, that they were referred to a Committee for consideration. It then appeared that the Architect had stipulated for the carrying • out of certain work beyond his original proposal, and although the additional work would no doubt be an improvement if considerations of cost were totally disregarded, they were of such a nature as to appear unnecessary in a building of the 63 character contemplated by the Vestry. The bills of quantities were therefore revised, and amended tenders invited from the various firms who originally competed. The tender of Mr. Mark Gentry, of Wormwood Street, E.C., for the sum of £5,573 was accepted, and the works commenced early in July. Upon the invitation of the Vestry, the Hon. Miss Stanley, who has long identified herself with works of philanthropy in the Parish and neighbourhood, consented to lay the Foundation Stone, and this ceremony was performed on Monday. the 26th July, the morrow of St. James's day. The following is the order of proceedings observed upon the occasion. The Building Committee, Vestrymen, and invited assembled at the Site (entrance in Silver Place) at a Quarter to Four p.m. At 4 o'clock, John Bonthrou, Esq., Chairman of the Building Committee, addressed the assembly. The Rev. H.N. D'Almaine, M.A., Incumbent of St. John's, Great Marlborough Street, in which District the Dwellings are situate. conducted a Service as follows:— OFFICE FOR LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Mely Ghost Amen. The Lord's Prayer. Miniiter: Show Thy servants Thy work, and thier children They glory. Answer : Prosper Thou the corks of our hands upon us. O proper then ??? handy-work. Minister: Except the Lord bnild the boo*, their laboar ■* build it.

Hallow with Thy blessing the house here to be built for the repose and protection of the labouring poor, especially those of the weaker sex. Grant that in all their labours they may labour in the Lord; and this we ask in the name of Jesus Christ Thy Son, our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen. O Lord God, Father Almighty, bestow Thy grace on all concerned in the government and support of this house, that they may faithfully and wisely fulfil the charge committed to them, and may find their reward in the sober, righteous, and Godly lives of those in whose behalf they undertake the duties here to be entrusted to them. Grant this, O Lord, for Jesus Christ's sake, our only Saviour and Redeemer. Anion. THE HONORABLE MAUDE STANLEY deposited in a cavity in the Foundation Stone a bottle containing a statement relating to the Building, a copy of the Times Newspaper of the day, a copy of the Report of the Vestry for the year 1884-5, and some current coins of the realm, and after duly laying the stone, declared the Building to have been formally commenced. The Choir then sang a hymn as follows— GOD our Help in ages past, Our Hope for years to come, Our shelter from life's stormy blast, And our eternal Home 1 Under the shadow of Thy Throne, Thy saints have dwelt secure ; Sufficient is Thine arm alone, And our defence is sure. Before the hills in order stood, Or earth received her frame, From everlasting Thou art God, To endless years the same. A thousand ages in Thy sight Are like an evening gone; Short as the watch that ends the night, Before the rising sun. 65 Time, like an ever rolling stream, Bears all its sons away; They fly, forgotten, as a dream Dies at the opening day. O God, oar Help in ages put, Our hope for years to come; Be Thon oar Guard while trochlea lsst, And oar eternal Home ! Amen. A vote of thanks to the Hon. Miss Stanley was moved by William Winnett, Esq., and seconded by Harry Privett. Ecq, And the Rev. J.E. Kempe, M.A., Hector of the Parish and Chairman of the Vestry, delivered a brief address and pronounced the benediction. The following is a copy of the statement deposited in the cavity in the Foundation Stone:— The funds for the erection of this Building were mainly derived from the sale of the Burial Ground situate in Hampatead Road and formerly be longing to the Parish of St. James, Westminster. The sale was effected under the provisions of a Special Act of Parliament obtain*d by the London and North-Western Railway Company in the year 1883. The Company sought power to acquire, on payment of £15,000, so much of the Barial Ground as had not been disposed of under the St. Jamea's Chapel Act ,1869. The Company were, however, restricted by Parliament from taking the whole of the ground for the purposes of their undertaking. and the Trustees of the Burial Ground were required by the Act of 1883 to convey a speed tied portion to the Company for the sum of £8,000, and the remaineder of the ground without further consideration to the Vestry of St. Pancras (within which Parish the Burial Ground was situate to be by them preserved as an open apace. The purchase money was directed by the Act to be applied to such ecclesiastical, parochial and other purpose for the benefit of the Parish of St. James's as the Trustees, with the sanction of the Vestry might direct. The money was paid into Court by the Railway Company and the Burial Ground conveyed as to a portion thereof to the Company and as to the remainder to the Vestry of St. Pancras. After mature deliberation, the Trustees decided to apply one equal moiety ecclesiastical purposes, and the other moiety to secular purposes for the benefit of the Parish, and the Vestry sanctioned this mode of applying the money. The moiety applicable to ecclesiastical purposee having been paid over to the Rector and Charchwardens opon certain defltite transt, it 66 became necessary to decide upon the particular secular purpose to which the remainder of the money should be devoted, and after having considered several proposals, the Trustees with the sanction of the Vestry, decided to apply the same, amounting to about £4,000,to the erection of a building for the accommodation of the labouring poor. This fund was supplemented by the assignment of a leasehold house, known as No. 7, Ingestre Place, which had been erected by voluntary effort in or about the year 1850, as a model lodging house, and a sum of about £2,000 being accumulated surplus rents derived therefrom, also by the transfer of a further sum of nearly £80,. being the unapplied balance of a fund raised for the relief of sufferers by a fire which occurred in Little Windmill Street in the year 1876, and by the transfer of a sum of £200, a portion of the funds remaining in the hands of the Trustees at the closing of the trust in July, 1886, under the provisions of the London and North-Western Railway Act 1884. The total sum thus available for the building is nearly £6,300. The Building is erected by the authority of an Order of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) made by Mr. Justice Pearson on the 3rd day of August, 1885, the scheme being set forth therein as follows:— 1. The funds are to be applied by the Vestry of the Parish of St. James, West minster (hereinafter called the Vestry) in or towards the erection and fitting up on the land comprised in the agreement dated the 18th May, 1885, and made between Sir Richard .Francis Sutton of the first part and the Vestry of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, in the County of Middlesex, of the second part, of a lodging house or lodging houses to be used together with the leasehold messuage and premises No. 7, Ingestre Place, for the accommodation at moderate rents of female pieceworkers and others of the labouring classes. 2. Such lodging house or lodging houses and the premises No. 7, Ingestre Place, are to be vested in the Vestry and to be under the control and management of the Vestry or a Committee appointed by them. A proper declaration or declarations of Trust of the premises comprised in the said Agreement for lease and of No. 7, Ingestre Place, shall be executed by the Vestry and enrolled pursuant to the Acts of 9 George 2nd chapter 36, and 24 Victoria chapter 9. 3. Any surplus income of the said properties after providing for repairs and other outgoings and expenses of management shall be invested in the name or names of the Vestry or of Trustees. 67 be appointed by the Vestry, and applied in such manner the Vestry with the approval of the Charity Commissicner for England and Wales or a court of competent juridiction shall hereafter determine, either in perpetuating and extending the operations of the scheme or for other purposes it or for the benefit of the said parish. Plana were invited from the four undermentioned Architects all of whom possess special knowledge of the requirements of Artisans Dwellings:- Mr. H.H. Collins, 61, Old Broad Street, E.C. Mr. H.M. Eyton, Ipswich. Mr. E.C. Robins, 14, John Street, Adelphi. Mr. Ernest Turner, 246, Regent Street. No premium was offered, bat a stipulation was made that if either design was adopted by the Vestry, the author thereof shoald be appointed Architect at the usual rate of remaneration. Each of the Architects named sent in a set of drawings, and the Vestry were aasisted in their choice by Mr. John Thomas Wimperis, of 25, Sackville Street, and Mr. D. Cubitt Nichols, of 3, Howard Street, Strand, who generously acted as honorary professional advisers. These gentlemen reported id favour of the design of Mr. H.H. Collins, and this report was approved by the Special Committee appointed to consider the matter and unanimously adopted by the Vestry. Mr. H.H. Collins was accordingly appointed Architect, and tenders for the erection of the building upon quantities taken out by Messrs. Gardiner, Son, and Theobald, of 110, Ureal Result Street, were invited from seventeen firms of builders, each of whom sent in a tender. Certain modifications were subsequently made in the quantities, and the tender of Mr. Mark Gentry, off, Wormwood street, in the City of London, to carry out the work on the revised quantities for the sum of £5,573 was accepted. The land upon which the building in to be erected is held on lease from Sir Richard Francis Sutton Part. for the terra of 68 years from the 34th June. 1885. at a ground rent of £50 per annum; the original ground rant of £74 having been reduced was to B.F. Sutton in consideration of the object for which the building was to be erected. The building is designed to comprise 23 single ??? 12 two room tenements, two rooms for the caretaker. and a general washhouse and work room. The work is commenced in the hope that it will benefit the poorer of the labourning classes in the Parish, to as ever increasing extant, as the surplus rents admit of an extension of the Trust. 68 BUILDING COMMITTEE. JOHN BONTHRON, Chairman. Rev. J.E. KEMPE, M.A., Rector. FREDERICK CRANE, Churchwarden. WILLIAM JENKINS, KENNETH McDONALD, FREDERICK HENRY BINGHAM, JAMES STYLES HARRY PRIYETT, ROBERT IREDALE JAMES LEWIS, WILLIAM WINNETT, . ROBERT EDWIN VILLIERS. H. H. COLLINS, Architect. MARK GENTRY, Builder. HARRY WILKINS, Vestry Clerk. July 26th, 1887. By the terms of the contract, the builder was under covenant to deliver the building to the Vestry completed on or before the 31st December, a penalty of £50 per week being attached to the non-performance of this covenant. Considerable delay has arisen in the completion of the work, and the building had not been completed at Lady-day. When the building has been delivered to the Vestry, the question of enforcing the penal clauses of the contract will be taken into consideration. The premises No. 7, Ingestre Place, were surveyed, and proved to be substantially built, but in need of considerable repair to adapt them to modern sanitary requirements. The subject was under consideration at the close of the year. A statement of the Accounts of the Trust fund to the 31st December, 1886, is given on pages 114 and 115 69 INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, having transferred to the Local Sanitary Authority the duty of inspecting retail bakehouses, the following abstract of the requirements of the law with regard to the cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and sanitary condition of retail bakehouses, is given for the information of parishioners:— 1. A bakehouses to be in conformity with the Acts relating to retail bakehouses, is subject to the following requirements (а) It must be kept in a cleanly state, and free from effulvia arising from any drain, privy or other nuisace. (b) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on then in as to be injurious to the health of the persons employed, and shall be ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, all the gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the manufacturing process that may be injuious to health. (c) The ceilings or tops of the bakehouse and all passages and staircases must either be painted with oil, or varnished, or limewashed, or partly painted or vanished. and partly limewashed. If painted at varnished. the surface must be covered with three coats of paint or vanish, and renewed once at least in every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap once it last in every six months. Limewashing is to be renewed once at least in every six months. 'J. No place on the same level with the bakehouse Bad forming part of the same building may be used as a sleeeping, unlees it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and has an external glazed window of at least mine superficial feet in area, of which at least four and a half feet are made to open for ventilalion. 3 A bakehouse must not be in soeh a slate as to be sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a hakeh uuse 70 4. No child, young person, or woman may be employed in a bakehouse contrary to tbe provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878. Penalties are provided in the event of an infringement of the law, and bakehouses brought into use after the 31st of May, 1883, are subject to certain further requirements. The bakehouses in the Parish (33 in number) are under frequent inspection by the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry. It has not been found necessary to take proceedings against the occupiers of any premises of that description during the past year. WATER SUPPLY. It was with some satisfaction that the Vestry observed the V introduction into Parliament of a Bill, on the lines suggested by the Vestry last year, to limit the powers of Water Companies to discontinue a supply of water to premises for which the water rates are payable by non-resident landlords. The provisions of the Bill would enable the Company to recover the rate from the tenant in default of payment by the landlord, and authorise the tenant to deduct the same from his rent. It would thus be unnecessary to cut off the water for the purpose of enforcing payment, and as the tenant pays the water rate to his landlord in the rent, no injustice would be wrought by attaching the rent under such circumstances. The Bill seems to afford so equitable a remedy against what might become a serious danger to the public health—a supply of water being especially necessary on sanitary grounds in tenement houses—that the Vestry have invited the co-operation of all Sanitary Authorities in the Metropolis in supporting the principle thereof. 71 SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. The following is a lint of the article.purchased by the Inspector and submitted to the Public Analyst, appointed by the Vestry, during the year:— Coffee 19 Cream 1 Milk 48 Mustard 4 71 Four of these samples (2 milk and 2 coffee) proved to bo adulterated, and proceedings were taken and a fine inflicted in each case. Five samples of milk were so poor in quality as to raise a suspicion of adulteration, but as the analyst was not prepared to positively assert that such milk might not bo yielded by cows under certain conditions, no action was taken beyond calling the attention of the vendors to the result of the analysis. As usual, most attention has been devoted to the examination of milk, to secure the purity which, as a diet of universal consumption, seems to be of the highest moment. As affecting young children especially, who are largely dependent upon the quality of this article for healthy growth, the adulteration of milk is not only a fraud upon its parrhaser but may seriously affect the future well-being of the chil d. It is therefore satisfactory to note that the proportion of adulterated samples to the total number purchased was smaller last year than at any previous time since the Acts were put in force in St. James's. As some misapprehension appears to exist with regard to the sale of coffee and chicory, and mixtures of a similar des¬• cription, it may be pointed out that the object of the ture is evidently to afford purchasersan opportunity of 72 dining to accept any article differing from that demanded. The mere wrapping of a mixture in a paper containing an intimation that the contents are sold as a mixture, is therefore not sufficient to comply with the law, unless the intimation is placed so prominently on the outside of the packet as to invite observation, or unless the attention of the purchaser is otherwise expressly directed to the nature of the article. If, for instance, the printed intimation is obscured by a fold in the paper, the Vestry are clearly of opinion that the printing would not of itself exonerate the vendor. The cost incurred by the Vestry for the year, in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, is as follows:— £ s. d. Allowance to Analyst 75 0 0 Purchase of Samples, &c. . 0 10 10 75 10 10 Fines recovered 4 0 0 Net cost to the Parish £71 10 10 SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS. Summonses have been taken out for the following offences:— Adulteration 4 Unsanitary condition of premises 9 Placing refuse in street 5 Obstruction 1 Neglecting to light hoard 1 Non-payment of cost of reinstating pavement, &c. 1 Defective paving 2 Intimidating servants of the Vestry 4 Total 27 73 The Vestry succeeded in all these cases: fines were inficted in 8 cases; orders were made for the execution of works in 7; the necessary works were executed before the hearing of the summons in 8 cases; and in the four cases of intimidation, which arose from a strike among the orderly boys, the summonses were dismissed with a caution to the offenders, on the vestry Clerk explaining that the object of the proceedings was not to inflict punishment in the present instance, hut to deter persons interfering with the servants of the Vestry in future. DISORDERLY HOUSES. It has been found necessary to institute proceedings in only one ease. The prosecution was successful, and the offenders having no means of paving the fine inflicted, underwent imprisonment. Several complaints have formed the subject of investingation, and in many instances a preliminary notice from the Vestry Clerk has proved effectual in ridding premises of tenants who used their houses or rooms for an improper purpose. DRINK1NG FOUNTAIN. Upon the application of the Metropolitan drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, the Vestry assented to the erection of a Drinking Fountain in the churchyard wall in Piccadilly, the Hector and Churcrhwardens having previouslv given their consent to the same. The Fountain has. been erected at the cost of Miss Tennant, as amemorial to the late Miss Lyttleton, and will be supplied with water, and maintained by the Association without cost to the parish. 74 URINALS. The following is a list of public urinals erected and maintained by the Vestry:— Situation. No. of Compartments. Situation. No. of Compartments. Bridle Lane 3 King's Arms Yard 3 Broad Street 8 Mason's Yard 3 Coach and Horses Yard 4 Ramilies Street 4 Cork Mews 2 Vine Street 7 Ham Yard 3 Wells Street 5 The proposal to erect a urinal in Bridle Lane, which was mentioned in last year's Report, has been carried into effect. The urinal stands near a blocked-up doorway, and the Vestry have undertaken to remove it in the event of this doorway being again required for use, or the return frontage of the premises to which it belongs being converted into a shop front. The Vestry have again waited upon the Metropolitan Board of Works in support of their application for permission to construct underground conveniences on the enclosed vacant ground at Piccadilly Circus, but, so far, without result. With a view to reduce the heavy charge for water used in flushing the urinals, the supply has been discontinued during the night, resulting in an economy of nearly £100 a year. A further economy is anticipated from some structural alterations which are now being- made to certain of the urinals. The cost of maintaining the urinals daring the year is as follows:— £ s. d. Water for flushing 325 14 1 Wages for cleansing 62 8 0 £388 2 1 75 CAB RANKS. The following is a list of the Cab ranks in the Parish. authorised by the Commisioner of Police :— No. of places. Broad Street 12 Haymarket (two Standings) 32 Piocadilly, by the Albany 11 Regent Street, opposite Vigo Street 3 St. James's Square 14 St. James's Street 30 Shaftesbury Avenue 25 Waterloo Place 3 The only rank which has a Cabmen's Shelter is that in St. James's Square. The shelter was provided and is maintained at private expense. PILLAR LETTER BOXES. With the assent of the Vestry, pillar letter boxes have been erected by the Postmaster- General in the under-mentioned thoroughfares:— Western district Albany. Beak Street. Brewer Street. Burlington gardens. Coventry Street. Golden Square. great Marlborough Street. New Burlington Street. Piccadilly, by the egyptian hall. Regent Street, by Piccadilly circus. Regent Street, Quadrant.

Regent Street by the County Fire Office, 7 p.m. till 3 a.m. St. James's Street (south end). Wardour Street, by Little Pulteney Street. FIRE BRIGADE. There is only one Fire Brigade-Station in the Parish, viz., at 99, King Street, Regent Street (near Argyll Place), but other stations in adjoining Parishes are available in cases of an outbreak of fire. The stations nearest this Parish are situate at No. 171, Great Portland Street, Oxford Street; 33, King Street, Portman Square; George Yard, Crown Street, Soho; and 44, Chandos Street, Covent Garden. Fire alarms in telegraphic communication with Fire Brigade Stations have been erected by the Metropolitan Board of Works in the undermentioned thoroughfares:— 77 Golden Square. Piccadilly, by St. James's Church. Pall Mall, by Marlborough House. Fire escapes with attendants are nightly stationed in Golden Square and next the Parish Church, Piccadilly. % MUSIC AND DANCING LICENCES. In accordance with the Standing Orders of the Court of Quarter Sessions, notices were given to the Vestry in the month of August, by intending applicants for Music and Dancing Licences, as follows:— Bignell, Robert Richard, The Trocadero, 7 and 8, Great Windmill Street, for Music only; also for Music and Dancing. Bratt, Edwin, 6, Swallow Street, for Music only. Dawkins, Edwin, Willis's Rooms, 26, King Street, St. James's, for Music and Dancing.

Spiers, Felix William, The Criterion, 221, Piccadilly, for Music and Dancing. Villiers, Robert Edwin, The London Pavilion Music Hall, Piccadilly, for Music only. A licence was granted by the Court of Quarter Sections in each case, with the exception of a License for Dancing to The Trocadero, application for which was withdrawn by Mr. bignell. 78 BILLS IN PARLIAMENT.

Approval was expressed of the principle of the Losses by Riot (Compensation), Steam engines and Boilers, leasehold Enfranchisement (by Purchase or Rentcharge), London Coal and Wine Duties continuance, Metropolitan Board of Works (Fire Brigade Expenses), and the Water Companies (Regulation of Powers) Bills. The Electric Lighting Act, 1882, Amendment Bill was under consideration at the close of the year in March. The views of the Vestry upon the subject of the London Coal and Wine Duties are given at some length on page 39; on the Water Companies (Regulation of Powers) Bill on page 70; and on the Metropolis local government Bill on page 81. THE CROSSING OF THE THAMES BELOW LONDON BRIDGE. The Vestry have received several communication from various Vestries and District Boards on the subject of providing means of communication between the north and south sides of the river Thames to the east of london bridge. Having given the matter careful consideration, the vestry arrived at the determination that the course proposed to be adopted by the Metropolitan Board of work is the most 80 prudent, in the interests alike of the ratepayers of the Metropolis and the vast population in the district for which additional means of communication are needed. The Metropolitan Board propose to seek powers to construct a tunnel, without delay, between Greenwich and Blackwall, and to defer coming to any decision as to the means of communication to he provided at or near Shadwell until the experience to be gained by the use of the bascule bridge at the Tower has shown whether it is practicable to erect a similar structure (which would be preferable on many grounds to a tunnel) a little lower down the river. FIRE BRIGADE EXPENSES. By the Act of Parliament constituting the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, three sources of revenue were provided, viz. (1) a contribution of £10,000 from the Government; (2) a contribution from the Fire Insurance Offices at the rate of £35 for every £1,000,000 insured, and (3) a rate not exceeding ½d. in the pound. The income arising from these three sources not proving adequate to the increasing demands on the Brigade consequent upon the growth of the Metropolis, the Metropolitan Board of Works are promoting a Bill in Parliament to increase the contribution of the Insurance Offices from £35 to £40 per million, and to raise the limit of the rate from ½d. to 1d. in the pound. The Vestry approve, in principle, of the extra cost of the Brigade being shared by the Insurance Offices, and not wholly borne by the ratepayers, and have requested the Right Hon. W. H. Smith, M.P., to support this view in Parliament. 81 LONDON GOVERNMENT. Some of the representatives appointed by various Vestries and District Hoards to attend a Conference at St. Pancras on this subject, having sought an interview with the Government, for the purpose of laving before them a resolution adopted at an adjourned meeting of the Conference, the Vestry pointed out to the Home Secretary that the views of the deputation did not necessarily express the opinions of the Vestries and District Boards of London, inasmuch as the representatives had no authority to wait upon the Government, and the Vestries and District Boards had not had any opportunity of considering the proposals to be submitted by the deputation. The Metropolis Local Government Bill, which was introduced into Parliament by Mr. Isaacs, a private member, was discussed by the Vestry, but in view of the improbability of the Bill being proceeded with this year, no resolution was passed on its merits. The views of the Vestry on thedirection in which reform in the government of London should proceed are given at length in former Annual Reports. OVERHEAD WIRES. In the month of November the Vestry again pressed upon the Government the increasing necessity of some control being exercised over the suspension and maintenance of telegraph and telephone wires across public streets. The urgent need of some action being taken in the matter was emphatically demonstrated by the general destruction of wires and supports by the snowfall which occurred on 82 the night of the 26th December. On that occasion falling wires in some instances, brought away portions of parapets of the houses, but fortunately no loss of life occurred. The Vestry's Surveyor reported at some length upon the injury to the wires and other property, and a copy of his report was forwarded to the Local Government Board, and also to the Metropolitan Board of Works, with an expression of opinion that the subject was one demanding serious attention, with a view to early legislation. SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON. At their Meeting on the 12th August, the Vestry learned with deep regret of the death of Mr. James Ross, one of the members of the School Board for the Westminster Division, and passed a vote of sympathy with his widow. Vacancies, in the School Board arising from death, resignation, or any similar cause, are not filled up by direct election by the ratepayers, but by the remaining members of the Board, and the Vestry expressed their opinion as to the manner in which the vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Ross might be most fittingly filled, in the following terms :— That the attention of the School Board for London be drawn to the fact that at the Election of Members of the Board, for the Westminster Division in November last, Mr. William Winnett received the Votes of 8,710 ratepayers, out of a total of 8,708 who polled, and that the Vestry do express to the Board their opinion that by his knowledge of the subject of elementary education, his practical acquaintance with the management of public elementary schools, his long connection with the work of public boards, and his aptitude for business generally, Mr. Winnett is eminently qualified to fill the place on the Board rendered vacant by the untimely death of Mr. James Ross. A copy of this resolution was forwarded to each of the other four Rating Authorities in the Westminster Division, and 83 resolutions to the same purport were passed by the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and the Westminster District Board of Works; the Vestry of St. George's, Hanover Square, expressed a hope that a ratepayer in the Division would be elected, and the Strand District Board of Works have all along declined to pass any opinion upon School Board matters. The election by the Board took place on October 14th, and in spite of the position obtained by Mr. Winnett at the poll in the previous November, and the representations of the Rating Authorities subsequently, Sir Guyer Hunter, Member of Parliament for Central Hackney, and a resident in Paddington was elected to fill the vacancy. The Vestry thereupon passed two resolutions as follows, and directed a copy thereof to be sent to each Hating Authority in the Metropolis:— That this Vestry most respectfully protests against the School Board for London filling up the vacancy on the Board caused by the death of Mr. James Ross, a representative of West minster, by the election of a candidate who is utterly unknown to the electors of the division and in no way acquainted with local requirements, especially as such candidate was nominated by a member for Chelsea and seconded by a member for Marylebone, while two members for Westminster proposed and seconded a local candidate who obtained such support at the last eloction that he would now bo a member of the Board but for the operation of the cumulative system of voting. That inasmuch as the School Board for London have in filling op the recent vacancy, utterly ignored the desires of the ratepayers of Westminster, the Education Department be asked to introduce a Bill into Parliament next session, providing for the filling up of casual vacancies on the Board by direct election by the ratepayers of the Division in which such vacancy has occurred, instead of by the Board itself. A copy of these resolutions was sent to every vestry and District Board in the Metropolis, and a largo proportion of the replies which were received expressed disapproval of 84 power being vested in the School Board to supply vacancies occurring in their body, without the slightest reference to the opinions or desires of the ratepayers. The Education Department stated, in reply to the representations of the Vestry, that the present mode of electing members to fill casual vacancies in School Board was introduced to remedy the evil of expense, and as far as their Lordships are aware had worked satisfactorily, and they were therefore not prepared to propose the change desired by the Vestry. The rejoinder to this reply would seem to be that if their Lordships regard as satisfactory the election of a stranger to the exclusion of a candidate extensively supported by the constituency in which the vacancy occurred, they might dispense with election by the ratepayers altogether, and thus remedy the evil of a much larger expense every three years. The Eating Authorities of London, however, do not appear to share the opinion of the Education Department with regard to the present system. A suggestion that the Parliamentary Electoral Districts should be adopted as the Electoral Districts of the School Board, incidentally involving the abolition of the cumulativesystem of voting, was received from the Vestry of St. Pancras. As the adoption of this proposal would diminish the representation of Westminster on the Board from fivemembers to three, the Vestry decided to confer with the other Rating Authorities in the Division before expressing a definite opinion thereon. The invitation to attend this conference was accepted by three of the four other EatingAuthorities (the Strand District Board adhering to its practice not to touch upon questions relating to the School Board), and a meeting of representatives was accordingly held at the St. James's Vestry Hall, on the 11th January, when Mr. Winnett, of St. James's, occupied the chair, and resolutions were passed as follows:— 85 That a report to the following effect, be submitted to each of the rating Authorities now represented for adoption — 1. That the Representatives of the rating Authorities of West- minuter assembled in Conference, are of opinion that the present Electoral Districts of the School Board for London are unsatisfactory and require immediate amendment. 2. That it is desirable to adopt some existing local area as the Electoral District of the School Board. 3. That it is not desirable to adopt the Parliamentary Divisions as such Electoral Districts for two reasons, viz.: (1) That a tendency might thereby arise to conduct School Board Elections on political lines, which cannot be deprecated too strongly; and (2) that the Parliamentary Divisions have been constructed upon the basis of population only, without regard to rateable value. 4. That the plan propounded by the Statistical Committee of the School Board is not satisfactory, inasmuch as it would continue, and in some instances create, overlapping Electoral Districts. 5. That the Bating District as defined by the Elementary tion Act, 1870, would be the most satisfactory area to adopt, for the following reasons. (1.) Each parish or district upon which the expenses of the London School Board are levied, would then be directly represented by a member or members. (2.) The schedule of the Metropolis local Management Act, 1855, setting forth such Bating Districts, has been adapted to the present time by the Amending Act of 1885. (8.) The proportionate representation of the ten divisions specified in the schedule to the Elementary Education Act would not materially differ from the present representation. (4.) The boundaries of the districts are well defined. (5.) No new or arbitrary district would be created; and (A) the cost of elections would be considerably reduced. That the St. James's Vestry be requested to circulate the foregoing resolutions among the Rating Authorities of the Metropolis, with a request that they will each appoint three of their members to join a deputation to the Vice-President of the Council in support thereof. 86 These resolutions were adopted by the Vestry on the 20th January, and the Vice-President of the Council was requested to receive a deputation from the Rating Authorities of London in support thereof. Another question in connection with the School Board has engaged the attention of the Vestry during the year. This was a proposal by the Board to establish a scheme for providing a superannuation allowance to their officers and teachers, which was brought to the notice of the Vestry by the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, who objected to the proposal. A resolution was adopted concurring in the objection, and a copy thereof forwarded to the School Board. It is understood, however, that the Board intend to press the scheme, and a Bill is now before Parliament to authorise the Board to pay superannuation allowances. The Vestry have petitioned against this Bill. SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION EXPENSES. Upon the invitation of the Wandsworth District Board the Vestry appointed three of their members to attend a Conference, with a view to considering as to taking steps for limiting the expenses of the triennial election of the School Board. Shortly afterwards, however, a circular was issued by the Education Department on the subject, and the proposed Conference was not held. DISTRESS AMONG WORKING CLASSES. On the 20th January, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Right Hon. C. P. Ritchie, President of the Local Government Board, calling attention to the distressed 87 dition of many persons of the working classes, and suggesting that tho execution of any contemplated works should, where practicable,be commenced at any early date, so that employment might be given them when work was more needed rather than later in the year, and further suggesting the employment of additional scavengers. All the information in the possession of the Vestry tended to show that, although a considerable amount of distress existed among the working classes, as is usually the case during a hard winter, it was neither of a nature nor extent, at least so far as this parish was concerned, to require exceptional treatment. The vestry were therefore not called upon to discuss the advisability of undertaking what may be called relief works, or incurring expenditure somewhat outdside their ordinary functions. DEMOLITION OF OLD BUILDINGS. The Metropolitan Board of Works having invited the Vestrv to express their views as to legislation to control the demolition of old buildings, in view of a probable application to Parliament to deal with the matter, the Vestry passed a resolution to the effect that they considered some such legislation would be desirable, and that the basis thereof should be the conferring of power on the Metropolitan board of works to frame live-laws, the same to be enforced by the local authorities. SUNDAY TRADING. This subject, which has engaged the attention of the Vestry on several previous occasions, was again brought under consideration by a letter from the Vestry of St. 88 George, Hanover Square, stating that they had requested the Commissioner of Police to take steps with a view to abating the annoyance arising from the noisy hawking of newspapers and wares, and suggesting that other local Authorities in the Metropolis should adopt a like course. The Vestry concurred in the views expressed in such letter, and addressed a communication to the Commissioner accordingly. A reply was received pointing out the difficulty in the way of successfully prosecuting itinerant vendors and promisingsuch help as the Police can afford in preventing the disturbance of divine worship. DEATH OF THE EARL OF IDDESLEIGH. A resolution was unanimously passed on the 20th January, expressing the Vestry's sense of the loss sustained by the country in the death of their distinguished parishioner, the Earl of Iddesleigh, and tendering their respectful sympathy to Lady Iddesleigh and her family in the painfully sudden bereavement and irreparable loss which they have sustained. CONCLUDING REMARKS. The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellowparishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner as possible, a statement of the principles which have guided them in the discharge of their trust, and particulars of the present condition of the Parish.

Rose and Crown Yard has been relaid with old granite pitching from George Street and the Stone Yard, at a cost of £61 7s. 6d. WOOD CROSSING. . • One wood crossing was put in on the north-east side Of Regent Street, at the entrance to Air Street. FOOTWAYS. The following work was carried out on the footways in streets which have been repaved:—York stone relaid, 76,527 square feet, granite kerb reset, 12,311 feet run. These dimensions include 33,001 feet of new York stone, and 3,214 feet of new kerb. OLD MATERIALS. The quantities of old materials sold were:—Wood, 72 cart roads ; iron, 8 tons 3 cwt.; York stone, 2,001 square feet ; pitching, 136 cart loads. REFUGE. The want of a refuge at the bottom of the Haymarket being greatly felt, your Vestry entered into negotiations with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields to erect one at the boundary between the two Parishes, with the result that one was ordered to be fixed at that spot, and lighted with an 80candle "Lambeth" lamp, at the joint expense. This was done accordingly. 95 LITTLE PULTENEY STREET IMPROVEMENT. Daring the past year this improvement has been completed. Little Pulteney Street has been widened, and is now nearly one and a half times its original width. It has also been lowered, thereby reducing its gradient, and the gradient of the new street cut through in place of Great Crown Court to connect it with, and now being a continuation of, Rupert Street. Groat Windmill Street has also been widened so as to admit a double line of carriages. Little Crown Court was originally entered from Great Crown Court (now rupert Street), through a narrow archway; this has been done away with, and the entrance is now the same width as the other part of the Court, and is open to the sky. The carriage ways have been paved with asphalte, the footways by the new buildings with Wilkes' "Eureka" paving, and the remainder with York stone. STONEYARD. In November last your Vestry purchased a third horse and sweeping machine to facilitate the cleansing of the streets. This necessitated the enlargement of the stable and harnessroom. Advantage was taken of these alterations to re-arrange the Stoneyard, and accordingly the sheds which were originally put up for the use of casuals from the Workhouse and which were not at all as now required. were pulled down and a new row of sheds erected. At the same time the whole ot the Stoneyard Paving was re-laid. Seperate sheds are now provided for the Works, Scavenging, Sewers. Orderly Boys' and Lighting Departments, Pipes, Lime, Cement, &c. Your Vestry also gave me directions to construct a snow plough and obtain two horse scrapers, which I did. 96 LICENCES Have been granted for the erection of one hundred and three hoardings and scaffolds for the purposes of re-building, alterations, &c. License has also been given in twenty-six cases to open the roadway to repair water pipes, or for similar purposes. The cost of make good these openings is charged to the person taking out the licence. COAL PLATES. During the past twelve months eighty-six coal plates were cut into the paving. STREET NAMES. The sum of £11 8s. l½d has been expended in purchasing and fixing street name-plates, principally for altering the names of Cross Street, Cross Court, and South Row to Ganton Street, Heddon Court to Heddon Street, and Great Vine Street to Warwick Street. LIGHTING. A "Westminster" lamp of 80 candle power has been fixed in the centre of Waterloo Place, and lamps with extra burners, in the centre of Arundell Street (at the top), on the refuge in Pall Mall by the Haymarket, at the corner of Lexington Street and Silver Place, and at the corner of Market Street, opposite Norris Street. Additional lamps have also been fixed in Cleveland Row, Little Crown Court,. Bridle Lane (urinal), Berwick Street (3), Archer Street, Great Windmill Street, &c. New lanterns with opal tops have been placed on the whole of the side lamps in Regent 97 Street and Waterloo Place, and columns of the Metropolitan Board of Works pattern erected round the wide part of Waterloo Place. The names of the side streets are shown on the corner lamps. The refuge lamps have been famished with a "midnight arrangement," and a man is now employed by your Vestry to light, extinguish, and clean these lamps and those in the urinals, and also to reduce tho light at 12 o'clock at night. SEWERS. At the upper end of Argyll Street, the sewer, a small brick barrel which had become very defective, was removed and earthenware pipes laid in lieu thereof. The work was carried out as far as possible underground to prevent disturbing the wood paving. Several of the small subsidiary sewers running under the vaults of the houses in Regent Street have been partially blocked. In each case the stoppage was removed, and where found necessary the old barrel drain destroyed and earthen ware pipes substituted. The cost of repairing sowers, bricking up old disused drains, new side entrance covers, Ac., amounted to the sum of £72 l1s. 7d. for the year. GULLIES. Fifty-six gullies have been reconstructed at a cost of £218 l1s. 2d. They are situate as follows:— Angel Court 1 Archer Street 3 brewer Street 2 Charles Street 4 Groat Vina Street 2 98 Great Windmill Street 2 Jermyn Street l Lexington Street 4 Market Street 1 Marlborough Row 2 Norris Street 3 Ormond Yard 1 Pall Mall 12 Pickering Place 1 Rose and Crown Yard 2 Regent Street 2 Rupert Street 6 Ryder Street 2 St.Alban's Place 2 Upper Rupert Street 2 Waterloo Place 1 56 CLEANSING SEWERS AND GULLIES. The cost of labour for cleansing the sewers was £138 7s. Od., and for emptying 1,176 gullies £65 2s. 4d. The accumulation removed from the sewers and gullies being carted away by the slopping contractor, under his contract, without extra expense. CONNECTIONS TO SEWERS. Fifteen new connections from houses have been made to the sewers by men in the employ of your Vestry. FLUSHING. The small sewers and courts were flushed at intervals during the hot weather as found necessary. The cost of water was £87 l1s. 4d. and repairing hose £6 9s. l0d. 99 DISINFECTING. The gullies and market streets were regularly disinfected during the summer months. The disinfectants used for all purposes amounting to G 43 gallons of carbolic acid, and 14 cwt. of carbolic powder, costing £47 4s. 10d. URINALS. A new urinal has been erected at the northern end of Bridle Lane by the Lion Foundry Company. It has proved to be of very great use. A constant supply of water is laid on to all the urinals in the parish except two. The cost of water was £262 2s. 5d., and repairs £11 13s. 4d. As stated last year these repairs are principally making good damage caused by persons unknown. MACHINE BROOMS. The machine brooms required re-filling with new bass, on the average once in six weeks. The cost of sundry repairs And re-filling amounted to the sum of £45 14s. l1d. WATERING. The street watering throughout the year was carried out by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a schedule of prices. The water is supplied by the Grand Junction Water Works Company by contract. STAND POSTS. The cost of re-packing the stand posts and executing sandry repairs and alterations was £35 19s. 8d. h 2 100 ORDERLY BOYS. There are now fourteen Orderly Boys at work in the main thoroughfares under the direction of a Foreman. It is a difficult matter to keep them constantly at their duties, but nevertheless they pick up a large quantity of horse droppings in the course of the day which would otherwise he carried all over the streets. Sixteen Bins have been placed in the streets for their use to prevent the nuisance which was previously caused by the accumulations by the kerb. DUSTING AND SLOPPING. The contract for dusting was carried out by Mr. Henry Covington, of Battersea Park, at a cost of £2,900, and that for slopping by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a cost of £1,600. I am, Rev.

Reverend SIR and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, for the year The census of 1881 gives the District of the Parish of St. James us covering an area of 162 acres and containing a population of 29,865. The Golden Square Sub-District appears as covering an area of 51 acres, and containing a population of 11,585. The Berwick Street Sub-District appears as covering an area of 108 acres, and containing a population of 18,280. Taking these data from the census, the mean density of the population of the whole District appears as 184 per acre, while the density of the population in the Golden Square Sub- 140 District appears as 215 persons per acre, and that of the Berwick Street Sub-District as 109 persons per acre. The net mortality for the year 1886 was 450 deaths. Taking the population at 29,865, 450 deaths gives a deathrate of 15.07 per 1,000. The mortality from Zymotic diseases during the year has been 29. Of Fever and Diphtheria 14 cases came under notice during the year; but many cases may not have been known, there being as yet no law requiring that notice of such cases be given to the Sanitary Authority. Of these 14 cases 1 was Diphtheria, 1 Typhoid Fever, and 12 Scarlet Fever. Eleven of the cases (all Scarlet Fever) were removed to extraParochial Hospitals. During the year 1886, 49 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. In 14 cases bodies were removed from the presence of families generally living in a single room, and where, but for the public Mortuary, the family would have lived and slept in the presence of a decomposing corpse, upon which, possibly, a post-mortem would have had to be made before interment could take place. In 15 cases the bodies have been removed from hotels or lodging-houses. Twentyone inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 17 post-mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room which adjoins the Mortuary. 141 The following numbers of Deaths were registered at having occurred in St. James's during the year 1886:— First Quarter 161 Second Quarter 125 Third Quarter 112 Fourth Quarter 95 Gross mortality for year 1886 493 Deduct deaths of Non-Parishioners:— Dying in the Workhouse 39 Dying in the Throat Hospital 4 43 Net mortality for the year 1886 450 450 deaths in a population of 29,865 is a death-rate of 15.07 per thousand. The net mortality and death-rate of St. James's have been continuously decreasing. These facts for the last ton years are shown in the following table, but, until we have a new census, it is difficult to know what changes are taking place in the population of St. James's since the census of 1881:— Gross Morlality. Net Mortality. Death Rates.

REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1886, MADE TO THE VESTRN of St. James, west minster, BY JAS, EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P., Lond., F.R.M.S., P.C.S., &c., Medical Officer of Health and Public Annlyst Jor St. Jams, Wettimmter. Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, During the year 1886, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, 67 samples were examined, of which 67 were procured for examination by the Vestry Officers, and two were brought by Parishioners. Of milk, 42 specimens have been examined. Only two of these samples were found to have been adulterated. In one of these cases the Vendor was summoned and fined Forty Shillings with costs; in the other case the sample was taken by a parishioner, and, the forms of the Act not having been complied with, no prosecution was instituted. It will bo obvious on comparing these facts with those set out in previous Annual Reports, that fraud in the sale of milk in the Parish of St. James has greatly diminished—doubtless in consequence of the prosecutions that have been instituted by the Vestry. In none of the samples was any Poisonous ingredient discovered. No money or consideration other than the stipend from the Vestry has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAME8 EDMUNDS. Grafton StrEEt, Piccadilly, 1887. 156 PARISH OF ST JAMES, WESTMINSTER.
