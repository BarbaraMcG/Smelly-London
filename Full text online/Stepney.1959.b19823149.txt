TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY. Your Worship, Ladies & Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my report for the year 1959 on the state of the public health in Stepney. According to the Registrar-General's estimate the population has decreased since last year from 96,360 to 94,900. There were 1,811 (1,818) live births and 1,246 (l,l6l) deaths. The live birth rate is 19.08 (18.86), the death rate 13.12 (12.04) and the infant mortality rate 24.84 (19.80). There were no maternal deaths during the year. Thirty-two (2l) babies died under the age of 4 weeks giving a neo-natal mortality rate of 17.67 (11.55). There was no serious epidemic of infectious disease during the year. The number of cases of measles was higher than last year - 1,344 compared with 199, indicating the usual biennial recurrence of this disease. The total notifications of infectious diseases was 1,998 (883). In spite of the hot summer I am glad to report that the incidence of poliomyelitis was not high. There were seven notified cases and three in the previous year. It is now possible to be protected against poliomyelitis by vaccine and arrangements have been made for the free vaccination of all persons up to the age of 40 at the London County Council's clinics in the Borough. The public are most earnestly entreated to avail themselves of this protection. Rates. Death Rate: Number of deaths per annum per 1,000 population. Still-birth Rate: Number of still-births per annum per 1,000 total live and still-births. Live Birth Rate: Number of live births per annum per 1,000 population. Infant Mortality Rate: Number of deaths per annum of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Maternal Mortality Rate: Number of deaths per annum of women ascribed to pregnancy, childbearing, abortion, etc., per 1,000 live and still-births. (The figures in parenthesis refer to the previous year, 1958). 2 There were no cases of smallpox and no deaths from diphtheria, measles, whooping cough or scarlet fever. Deaths from cancer of the lung continue to increase, from 62 to 77, and so too does cigarette smoking, boosted by the great publicity drive to popularise new brands of cigarettes. In England and Wales during 1958 fifty-four people died daily from cancer of the lungs. By comparison motor vehicle accidents were responsible for 15 deaths a day and tuberculosis 12 deaths a day. The Minister of Housing and Local Government in March gave provisional approval to the Council's first Smoke Control Area under the Clean Air Act, 1956. The Smoke Control Order for this area was made by the Council in November and on the Minister's confirmation it is probable that it will come into operation on 1st November, 1960. A programme of further areas has been prepared and it is possible that smoke control will be operative over the whole of the Borough by 1970. The Council's Holiday Centre at Sandgate established under the Physical Training & Recreation Act, 1937, remained open throughout the year and was heavily booked up in the summer season. In presenting my report I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of Committees for the encouragement and support which I have received from them. To all the Staff of the department I accord my thanks and particularly to those who have so willingly helped me in the preparation of this report. I have the honour to be, Your Worship, Ladies & Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. R. O'SHIEL, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STAFF OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT at 31st December 1959 MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH F. Roantree O'Shiel, L.R.C.P.I., L.M., D.P.H.

STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA General Information. The Metropolitan Borough of Stepney is bounded on the west side by the City of London, on the east by the Borough of Poplar, on the north by the Boroughs of Shoreditch and Bethnal Green and on the south by the River Thames, the river front being some 2.39 miles in length. It is roughly rectangular in shape, the length being 2.3 miles and the breadth varying from 1 to 1½ miles, and contains approximately 90 miles of streets. The area of the Borough is 1,902 acres and of this the river accounts for 136 acres and the inland water, consisting of docks and canals, 75 acres. Dark blue London Clay is found under the whole borough at a depth of between 20 and 30 feet from the surface. Above this level are layers and patches of gravel and sand, brown and yellow clays being found nearer the surface. In some parts of the Borough there are layers of "made" ground, the result of earlier habitation, and, as is to be expected, the flow of subsoil water is towards the river. The area is to a large extent industrial in character, factory premises being spread throughout the Borough but tending to be concentrated towards the western end, with docks and wharves stretching along the whole of the river front which forms the southern boundary. The chief industry of the Borough is the manufacture of clothing of all kinds, and it is estimated that one-third of the tailoring industry of London is carried on in Stepney. Other major industries include brewing, cigarette making, engineering and the manufacture of furniture. Stepney is also one of the most important wholesaling districts in London. The Spitalfields wholesale fruit and vegetable market and the London Fruit Exchange are situated in the Borough. Other notable landmarks in the Borough are the Tower of London and the Royal Mint. Reduction in Wards and Membership of Council. Following the making by the Secretary of State of The Stepney (Councillors and Wards) Order, 1958, which came into operation on the day of the ordinary election of members of the Council this year, membership of the Council was reduced from 60 to 40 Councillors and from 10 to 6 Aldermen and the Wards and ward boundaries revised so that there are now 14 Wards as against 20 formerly. Fifty Years Ago. The Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1909 contains the following information. The estimated population was 312,525, and the birth-rate was reported to be30.4, the lowest then on record. 6 The death rate was 15.2 and the infant mortality rate was 118 per thousand births. Among the causes of deaths reported were Tuberculosis 665, Measles 236, Cancer 202, Premature Births 156, Diarrhoea 153, Enteritis 104, Whooping Cough 65, Alcoholism 52, Diphtheria 51 and Scarlet Fever 25. Deaths of children under one year included 134 from Diarrhoea and 76 from Enteritis. There were 220 inquests on children under five years of age, 38 deaths being attributed to overlying in bed by parents, 49 to convulsions and 24 to burns and scalds. Notifications of infectious disease included 907 cases of Scarlet Fever, 491 of Diphtheria, and 8 cases of Smallpox. The Report contains the information that at that time there were 38 Common Lodging Houses in the area, providing accommodation for 6,900 persons; also 37 Cowhouses housing 796 cows. Of the 1,203 samples of food analysed 140 (or 11.6/5) were found to be adulterated, as a result of which 75 prosecutions were taken. 117 samples of milk and 19 of butter were found to be adulterated. 87 samples of milk were taken on Sundays, 14.9% of these being adulterated. Fifteen milk sellers were prosecuted for using dirty milk vessels and utensils and 16 for selling milk while not being registered for the purpose. An attempt was made to salt and smoke horse tongues and sell them as reindeer tongues, but did not prove a success. In one shop in the Borough there was a curious combination of trades, viz., purveying of cats meat (horseflesh) and tea, and the curling of feathers. There were 35 purveyors of cats meat in the area. The average number of persons per dwelling was 9.4. In 1909 the Council appointed its first Health Visitor, Miss Isabel Virtue, at a salary of £100 per annum. That year also the Council decided to acquire the Lord of the Manor's rights in the waste manorial land on both sides of part of Whitechapel Road and Mile End Road at a cost of £1,500, in order to lay out the land as a retail market and public gardens. During the year ended 31st March, 1909, 14,647 loads of hay and 4,686 loads of straw were brought into the Whitechapel Hay and Straw Market. A tollage of 6d was payable for each load of straw, one-third of the sum collected being paid to the Lord of the Manor. Population. The Registrar-General's mid-year estimate for 1959 is 94,900. Last year's estimate was 96,360, while the Census taken in 1951 showed the population to be 98,858. The section of the Registrar-General's Report on the 1951 Census dealing with the usual residence and workplace of the population, revealed that the Borough's day—time population was 141,400 compared with 98,858 night time population - an increase of over 44%. 7 The density of population is now 53.73 persons per acre. During the year, there was a natural increase in population of 565; that is there were 565 more births than deaths. The Registrar-General estimates the population to be 1,460 less than last year, the indication being that 2,025 persons have moved out of the Borough. Births. The total number of live births registered in the Borough during the year was 3,752, and of this number 2,150 belonged to other areas. In addition 209 births belonging to Stepney occurred outside the Borough, making a total of 1,811 births (978 Males and 833 Females) to Stepney residents. The live birth-rate is 19.08 per 1,000 of the population. The rate when adjusted by the comparability factor is 17.0, compared with the rate for England and Wales of 16.5. Illegitimate live births numbered 204, representing 11.26% of the total live births - the highest since 1945. Stillbirths numbered 37, representing a rate of 20.02 per 1,000 total births. Marriages. The number of marriages in the Borough during the year was 760, being 15 less than last year. The marriage rate per 1,000 population is 16.0, compared with 16.1 in 1958. Deaths. The net number of deaths registered during the year was 1,246 (729 Males and 517 Females), compared with 1,161 last year. The rate of 13.12 compares with 12.04 for 1958. The death rate of 13.12, when adjusted by the comparability factor is 14.0 as compared with 11.6 for England and Wales. The principal causes of death were heart disease which accounted for 26% of the total deaths, diseases of the respiratory system 20%, and cancer 19%. Deaths of persons over the age of 65 amounted to 66% of the total deaths. Details of deaths by cause and age are given in Table 1 of the Appendix, on pages 53 and 54. In England and Wales today, the expectation of life at one year is 69 for males and 74 for females, compared with 40 and 42 years respectively in 1841, and 59 and 63 between the years 1930-32. Infant Mortality. Deaths of infants under one year numbered 45, giving a rate of 24.84 8 per 1,000 live births, compared with 19.80 last year. The rate for England and Wales is 22.0, the lowest ever recorded. Of the infant deaths 32 were under four weeks old, representing a neo-natal mortality rate of 17.67 per 1,000 live births. Last year, there were 21 neo-natal deaths and the rate was 11.55 per 1,000 live births. The neo-natal mortality rate for England and Wales is 15.8. The "peri-natal" mortality rate of infants (viz., stillbirths plus deaths occurring in the first week of life) was 35.17, as compared with 29.68 last year. The Tables on page 55 show deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year, together with comparative figures over the last five years. Maternal Mortality. There were no maternal deaths during the year. Accidental Deaths. The number of deaths due to accidents was 32, the same as last year. These included 8 due to motor vehicles (two less than in the previous year), 14 in the home, 1 at work, 4 from drowning and 5 due to various other causes. (See Table on page 54 relating to Road Accidents). It is interesting to note that 50 years ago 13 residents of the Borough died as a result of motor vehicle accidents. Accidents in the Home. Many more deaths now occur from accidents in the home than from road accidents, and the public cannot be urged too strongly to see that all possible precautions are taken in the home in order to minimise them. No fewer than 7,000 persons throughout the country died in 1958 from home accidents - compared with 5,439 deaths due to motor vehicle accidents and 3,999 from lung tuberculosis. The powers and duties of the Council under Section 82 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1957, relating to the dissemination of information and advice for promoting safety in the home and encouraging proper precautions against accidents, are exercisable by the Public Health Committee and the means taken to educate the public in this respect are referred to elsewhere in this Report. The County Medical Officer of Health supplies me with information which he obtains from the London Ambulance Service relating to the admission to hospital of home accident cases occurring in London and in the London County Council Health Division No.5, of which Stepney forms a part. A Table summarising these figures over the past four years is given on page 56. Whilst the figures may not be fully comprehensive they give a reasonably accurate picture. 9 Returns have also been received from hospitals in London of both in-patients and out-patients treated for injuries arising from home accidents for the six months from July to December. During this period 183 Stepney residents were treated. Sixty-six accidents were due to falls and 55 to cutting or piercing instruments. A Table giving more detailed information is given on page 57. Old people are prone to home accidents and the Department's Women Hygiene Officers pay great attention to this during their visiting; as for example where accidents from gas appliances have occurred, or are likely to occur, they have been instrumental in obtaining for the old people concerned a special safety-type gas cooker. Following a fire which occurred in a house in the Home Counties in November, it was discovered that drip-feed radiant oil heaters could give rise to serious fires when operated in draughts commonly encountered in dwellings. In a Parliamentary Answer in the House of Commons, the Home Secretary stated that the number of fires in the home caused by heaters in 1958 were as follows:- Oil heaters 2,128 Electric heaters 928 Gas heaters 84 An exhibit showing the work of the Department in relation to safety in the home formed part of an exhibition on "Stepney's Housing Progress" held during April at the Council's Mile End Library. Unemployment. The Ministry of Labour has kindly supplied me with the following information as to the estimated number of persons residing in the Borough who were registered as unemployed at the end of the year :- Men Boys Women Girls 1,609 14 214 17 - Total: 1,854. The total number of unemployed at the end of 1958 was 2,447. Open Spaces. There is in the Borough a little over half-an-acre of Parks and Open Spaces per 1,000 population. A list of the sites is given on page 76. Comparative Statistics. A Table showing vital statistics for the Borough for various years from 1901 is on page 58. 10 II. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES aged persons welfare. The Council is empowered by Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, to make application to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to a hospital or institution of any aged, infirm or physically incapacitated person who is living in insanitary conditions and who is in need of care and attention. During the year, it was necessary to apply for six Removal Orders and three Extension Orders under this enactment in respect of the following persons:- Person Age Removed To Remarks Mr. P.H. 80 Hospital Emergency Order for 3 weeks. (Died). Mrs. E.K. 70 Hospital Emergency Order for 3 weeks. Transferred to Institution. (Still away). Mrs. V.H. 68 Institution Emergency Order for 3 weeks. Extension of Order for 3 months. (Still away). Mrs. M.L. 76 Hospital Order for 6 weeks. Extension of Order and transfer to Institution for 3 months. (Died) Mrs. F.G. 83 Institution Emergency Order for 3 weeks. Extension Order for 6 weeks. (Died). Mrs. M.B. 75 Hospital Emergency Order for 3 weeks. (Still away). In addition to those persons removed under Magistrates' Orders, admission to hospital or institution was obtained for 15 other persons. Two women officers, one of whom, is a state registered nurse and certificated health visitor, are employed for visiting aged persons in the Borough, and 4,255 visits were made by these officers during the year. A register of all old persons visited is kept in the Department. Amendments made to the register during the year are as follows:- Number on register at 1st January, 1959 1,635 Additions during the year 324 Removals during the year 417 Number on register at 31st December, 1959 1,542 11 A revision of the register took place this year. Visits were made to the homes of all old persons who had not been visited for some time; many were found to have moved, some had died and for these and various other reasons 417 were removed from the register. In November a letter was addressed to some 300 persons or organisations whose work brings them into contact with old people, e.g. general practitioners, hospital almoners, voluntary and statutory welfare organisations, churches, postmasters, members of the Council, etc., reminding them of the services available in the Borough for the benefit of old people. With the letter was enclosed a small poster inviting people to notify the Medical Officer of Health of any old person found to be in need of care and attention together with a supply of printed postcards for use in notifying the Medical Officer of Health of any such person. The response was heartening and attention was drawn to a number of old persons in need of one or other of the services available. The Department continued operating its laundry service for the chronic sick who are unable by reason of ill-health, senility, etc. to keep their personal laundry and bed linen in a clean condition. During the year 412 parcels of laundry were dealt with. In order to prevent injury, or danger of injury, to health, Section 43 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953, operated by the Borough Council, makes provision for the personal cleansing in their own homes of aged persons who are verminous or otherwise in need of a bath. 871 baths were given to 79 old people, during the year, by the Borough Council's Home Bathing Service. Grants may be made under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, to voluntary associations whose activities include the provision of recreation and meals for old people. Grants made by the Council to the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association and to old people's clubs during the year amounted to approximately £6,800. There are 19 old people's clubs in the Borough, sixteen being affiliated to the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association.* The Council is represented on this body by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and other members of the Council and by the Medical Officer of Health, and applications made to the Council by old people's clubs for grants under the National Assistance Act, 1948, are referred to the Association for investigation. The Stepney Old Age Pensioners Club at Holy Trinity Hall, Maplin Street ceased to function during the year and a new club opened, viz., Our Lady's Pensioners Club, Commercial Road, E.14. A list of Clubs and the facilities thereat will be found on page 77. * Hon.Secretary, The Stepney Old People's Welfare Association, St.Katharine's, Butcher Row, Cable Street, E.14. (Tel: STEpney Green 3659). Voluntary visitors are urgently needed and should apply to the Secretary. 12 A Mobile Meals Service is run jointly by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association and the Women's Voluntary Service, and there is also a 'Kosher' service for Jewish pensioners operated by the Beaumont Hall Settlement. A weekly average of 431 meals were delivered to home-bound old people during the year. Five of the clubs which include a luncheon club among their facilities provided an average of 332 meals each week. A 'Kosher' luncheon club was opened this year at the Brady Girls' Settlement, Hanbury Street. A Chiropody Service with a whole-time chiropodist is provided by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association at clinics situated in six of the old people's clubs in the Borough, and on an average 300 treatments were given each month, including domiciliary treatments. The Royal Foundation of St.Katharine last year appointed a visitor whose job it is to visit and care for elderly people suffering from some form of mental anxiety, in an attempt to prevent further deterioration and to help them to keep active and interested in the community. Over 100 old people have received visits during the year from this visitor. There has been an increase in the number of voluntary workers who visit old people. About fifty voluntary visitors are now in regular touch with 120 of them. In addition, the staff and voluntary workers attached to the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association's Office maintain contact with about 500 old people. AMBULANCE FACULTIES. The London County Council is responsible under Section 27 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, for the provision of ambulance transport within the Administrative County of London. CONFERENCES. The Council was officially represented at the undermentioned Conferences during the year :- Conference Held At Attended By Royal Society of Health Annual Congress.

Inquests were held on 58 residents of the Borough, the verdicts being 8 deaths due to road accidents; 22 other accidents; 21 suicides; 1 homicide; 1 misadventure; 3 natural causes; 1 open verdict, and 1 due to excessive alcoholism. Burials. Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places a duty on the Council to arrange for the burial of any persons found dead within the Borough where no private arrangements have been made. Twenty-five such burials (22 adults, 2 children under ten, and one stillborn baby) took place, during the year, at a cost of £254, of which sum £142 was recovered by the end of the year from the estates of the deceased persons or from liable relatives or by way of grants made under the National Insurance Act, 1946. Requests for burial came from the following sources:- H.M. Coroner's Officer 16 Relatives of Deceased 6 Friends of Deceased 3 It is often necessary where persons living alone die in the Borough, to dispose of the contents of their homes. This is done in conjunction with relatives of the deceased, or with the Treasury Solicitor where there are no known relatives, and has the effect of releasing the accommodation for housing purposes as soon as possible. Six bodies recovered from the river were received into the Mortuary during the year. FREE WASHING FACILITIES. The Council provides free washing facilities in sixteen of the 22 public conveniences, with the aim of promoting food hygiene and cleanliness. Some 88,000 free washes were taken during the year. HEALTH EDUCATION. Health education is becoming an increasingly more important activity of local authorities. Every effort is made to reach as broad a section of the public as possible in the dissemination of publicity relating to general health matters, whilst educational material relative to particular subjects is distributed to selected sections of the public as applicable in each case. The Council co-operated with the London County Council in its Annual Home Safety Week Campaign in November, with the emphasis being laid on the prevention of falls which account for some 60% of fatal home accidents. In conjunction with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 14 posters published by that body were exhibited in connection with "Check That Fall" publicity. We also co-operated with the Central Office of Information in a "Keep Britain Tidy" campaign organised for the August Bank Holiday week-end. The former Empire Marketing Boards were used to display various posters, during the year, as also were the Council's official notice boards and boards affixed to lamp columns in street markets in the Borough. The Exhibition Stand situated in the entrance hall of the Public Health Department was used to display poster sets and flannelgraphs on various health matters and was kept stocked with relevant leaflets. This stand was also used as part of the Department's contribution to the Council's Housing Exhibition held at Mile End Library in April. With the co-operation of the Borough Librarian, bookmarks and leaflets on various health subjects were distributed from the Lending Sections of the Borough Libraries. The photograph facing this page shows some of the literature on health matters available to the public in the Council Libraries. Enamelled panels giving details of hospitals and times of attendance where advice on or treatment of venereal diseases can be obtained were renewed, as necessary, in the Council's Public Conveniences. Vacant sites in the Borough were kept posted with notices warning the public against depositing rubbish and also against the use of land as caravan sites. In all, over.2,100 posters were displayed throughout the Borough during the year and 17,000 leaflets distributed. HOLIDAY CENTRE. The second year's operation of the Council's Holiday Centre, the Manor House, Sandgate, near Folkestone, has confirmed the success of the venture. During the year, 777 Stepney residents spent a holiday at the Manor House. This number included 421 aged persons and 129 children. The total number of weekly bookings was 1,091. The Council decided this year to make an increased grant to the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association in order to enable old persons to have a holiday during the winter months, from November to March inclusive, at the reduced rate of 30/- per week, instead of the normal charge of £2 per week to such persons. The Holiday Centre is open all the year round and is available for holidays to any resident of the Borough, young or old. Half the total accommodation is allotted each week to the latter. Coach transport is provided to and from the Public Health Department and the Manor House. The management and control of the Holiday Centre are vested in the Council's Physical Training & Recreation Committee, and the day-to-day administration is the responsibility of the Medical Officer of Health. 15 HEALTH EDUCATION Halifax Photos Ltd.

The water is subjected to a continuous chlorination and filtration process, the water passing through the filters once in every 3½ hours. Samples were taken during the year for bacteriological and chemical analysis. Two were found to be unsatisfactory - one by reason of high bacterial content, the other revealing a high pH value.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES The District Public Health Inspectors served 2,596 notices during the year, and in -41 cases legal proceedings were employed to enforce compliance therewith. Included amongst the new legislation affecting the Department this year was Section 25 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, which gives permissive power to the Council to require the owner or occupier of any inn, refreshment house or place of public entertainment to provide and maintain such number of sanitary conveniences for the use of persons frequenting the premises as may be reasonable. In addition, the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1958, transferred to the Borough Council, as from 1st January, 1959, the duty of enforcing the provisions of Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, relating to lighting, facilities for taking meals, and washing facilities for employees. At the end of the year the Department was still four below the establishment of district inspectors. Animals. It is unusual nowadays in Metropolitan London to have to investigate the housing conditions of farm animals. However, such a case occurred in the Borough this year, when a litter of pigs, a lamb, some geese and hens were discovered in a backyard. Steps were taken to have the pigs removed, but as it was ascertained that they were subject to a Swine Fever Movement Restriction Order their removal could not take place immediately, and subsequently some died from the disease. Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act. 1957). During the year 85 applications were received from tenants for Certificates of Disrepair under the Rent Act, 1957. The Council exercised its right under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule to the Act in refusing to accept undertakings from landlords in respect of 10 premises. Last year 238 applications from tenants were received, and in 1957 (the Act came into operation on 6th July that year) 490 applications were received. Clean Air. Under the Clean Air Act, 1956, the Minister of Housing and Local Government in March gave provisional approval to the Council's proposal to the making of its first Smoke Control Order. The area concerned, situated along the Borough's boundary with the City of London, is one of 164 acres, and comprises 1,979 dwellings and 938 commercial, industrial and other premises. It was ascertained from a survey of the area 22 that the number of appliances in regular use,in dwellings, and which required replacement or adaptation, was 1,433. Included in this number were 1,280 open fires, 86% of which were found to require replacement by approved appliances. The Smoke Control Order for this area was made by the Council in November, and at the end of the year the Minister's confirmation of the Order was awaited. Meantime the preliminary survey of the second Smoke Control Area was commenced. At the beginning of the year a Circular was issued by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, in which he stated that he hoped it would be possible for local authorities in the 'Black Areas' (of which London is one) to make faster progress in making smoke control areas, and asked local authorities to decide on the Smoke Control Orders needed in their areas, in which order of priority they should be made, and how many years were likely to be taken to complete the work; and that they should prepare a phased programme for establishing Smoke Control Areas over the next five years. As a result, the Council submitted to the Minister a programme outlining the proposed establishment of a Smoke Control Area during each of the subsequent four years, and aiming at the making of smoke control orders covering the whole of the Borough by the year 1970. Facing this page is a map showing the first Smoke Control Areas proposed to be established in the Borough. Prior approval was given during the year to plans and specifications of furnaces submitted under Section 3 of the Act and proposed to be installed in four industrial premises, and notifications of proposal to instal furnaces were received in respect of eleven other premises. The Council supported a proposed Bill against the statutory exemption of furnaces equipped with mechanical stokers. Measurements of air pollution are regularly taken in the Borough by means of deposit gauges and lead peroxide instruments, which give monthly records of deposited matter and of concentration of sulphur in the air, and also by combined smoke filters and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus which afford daily readings. Summaries of the recordings obtained from these instruments will be found in Tables 8 and 9 on pages 59 and 60, and details of visits and inspections made by the Smoke and Factories Inspector are given on page 61. Drainage and Sanitary Conveniences. The owners of three premises appealed against notices served on them under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in respect of defective drains> on the grounds that, as the drains served other premises, the owners of those premises were liable to contribute towards the expense of executing the work. In one case the appeal was subsequently withdrawn on payment of £3.3.0d costs to the Council. In 23 another, the Court adjourned the matter sine die so that the respective owners could consult and agree on sharing the costs of the drain repair. When the third case ultimately came before the Court, after various adjournments, considerable argument took place, and the Magistrate, after visiting the site, ruled that the appellant should pay two-thirds of the costs of the repair to the drain, and the occupier of the adjoining property one-third, and that costs of £20 be paid to the Council, apportioned on the same basis. Factories. Under Section 128 of the Factories Act, 1937, the Mcdical Officer of Health is required, amongst other things, to report to the Council, in his Annual Report, specifically on the administration of, and furnish the prescribed particulars with respect to, matters under the Act administered by the Council. The prescribed particulars referred to will be found in the Appendix, pages 62 and 63. Legal Proceedings.

The proprietor had carried out some alterations to the premises during the year, which are now being used as a hostel.

Rowton House and Providence Row Night Refuge. Rowton House, in Fieldgate Street, Whitechapel, which was opened.in 1902,. supplies accommodation for 796 men, and Providence Row Night Refuge provides for 135 men, women and children. 25 Noise Nuisance. Twelve complaints of noise nuisance were investigated during the year. Legal proceedings under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937, were instituted in one instance, against the occupier of a dressmaking factory for causing a noise nuisance from sewing machines to the residents living in the lower part of the premises. The magistrates made an order for the abatement of the nuisance and ordered the defendant to pay £5.5.0d costs. The Council also summoned the same person under the Byelaws for Good Rule and Government for operating a wireless loudspeaker in such a manner as to cause annoyance. On this summons the occupier was fined £1.0.0d. The Council this year became a member of the newly formed Noise Abatement Society. Notices Served.

Number of firms in the Borough employing Outworkers 79 Number of Outworkers residing in, and employed by firms in the Borough 237 Number of Outworkers residing outside the Borough, employed by firms in the Borough 757 Number of Outworkers residing in the Borough employed by firms outside the Borough 360 Legal proceedings were instituted against an occupier of a clothing factory for failing to supply the Council with a list of outworkers employed by him. £5.5.0d costs were awarded to the Council, the defendant being conditionally discharged. 27 Refuse Disposal. The Public Cleansing Officer has kindly supplied the following information on refuse disposed of during the year:- House and Trade Refuse 34,516 Tons Street and Market Refuse 8,518 " Where possible, refuse collection is carried out by means of "Paladin" containers, mainly from blocks of flats throughout the Borough. This method was adopted in,1955) since when over 600 of these containers have been installed. The Cleansing Department carried out 30,779 cleansings of 5,300 street gullies by means of mechanical gully emptiers. Rodent Control. In accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, statistics on rodent control work carried out by the department were submitted to the Ministry covering only the 9 months period 1st April, 1959, to 31st December, 1959. During this period 4,899 dwellings and business premises were inspected, and 1,102 were found to be infested either by mice or rats. Treatments were carried out by the department's rodent control staff to 941 of the properties found to be infested, the charges made for servicing business premises amounting to £583. By the implemcrtation of Section 4 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, it has been found possible to clear bombed sites of refuse which would otherwise act as possible harbourage for rats and other vermin. Moreover, under the same section, which permits specified works to be carried out, it has been possible to require sites to be fenced in by the owners. Default action was taken by the Council regarding two such sites, and the cost of removing refuse and fencing the sites was charged to the owners thereof. Legal proceedings were instituted on three occasions during the 9 months ended 31st December, 1959, against the owners of sites for failure to comply with notices served under Section 4 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, requiring them to clear the sites of rat harbourage and to make suitable provision for enclosing the sites to prevent further depositing of rubbish, A copy of the return furnished to the Ministry is on page 64. Section 11 of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, made provision for a grant of 50^ to the Council of expenditure incurred in the eradication of rats and mice, but by virtue of Section 4 of the Local Government Act, 1958, the grant ceased on 31st March this year. 28 Commencing this year, the Council has undertaken, at the request of the Stepney Group Hospital Management Committee, to carry out any necessary treatments for rodent infestation at hospitals and other premises in the Borough coming under the control of that Committee. Shops. Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1958, transferred from the County Council to the Borough Council, from 1st January, 1959, the powers and duties of Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, relating to the provision for employees in shops of adequate lighting, facilities for the taking of meals, and washing facilities. The number of premises in the Borough covered by the provisions of the Shops Act is 3,046. Two applications were received during the year for exemption from complying with the sanitary accommodation requirements. Certificates of exemption were not granted in respect of the premises concerned. Water Certificates. Water certificates as to new dwellings having a proper and sufficient supply of water were issued in respect of 459 flats and 10 houses under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Water Supply. The whole of the Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, which is the authority responsible for its purity. The quantity and quality of water supplied by the Board during the year have been satisfactory. All the premises in the Borough are supplied individually direct from public water mains. The number of instances where the water supply to premises in the Borough was repaired or reinstated totalled 93, and the Metropolitan Water Board was notified on 27 occasions where wastage of water was taking place. During the year 17 notices were received from the Metropolitan Water Board of withdrawal of water supply; in 11 premises for nonpayment of rates and in 6 because of defects in the service. Wells.

The Housing Inspector, in conjunction with officers of the Borough Engineer & Surveyor's Department, inspected 150 requisitioned houses in connection with their purchase and conversion. New Housing. During the year 469 new dwellings were completed in the Boroughs 44 by the Borough Council, 423 by the County Council, and 2 by private enterprise. (See Appendix, page 68 ). A total of 6,706 new permanent dwellings have been constructed in the Borough since the Wars 4,383 by the London County Council; 2,127 by the Borough Council; 69 by the Corporation of London, and 127 by private enterprise. Facing this page is a photograph of some 17-storey blocks of dwellings being erected in the Borough by the County Council. An Exhibition showing Housing progress in Stepney was held in Mile End Library in April. Caravans. Several tines during the year residential caravans were reported to have arrived in the Borough and parked on bombed sites. These were visited by the Housing Inspector immediately the information was received, and the occupiers were persuaded to vacate the sites. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, in Sections 22 and 23, makes provision for borough councils to grant licences authorising persons to use or allow to be used land as sites for moveable dwellings, and on and after 1st October, I960, it will be an offence to use or allow to be used land for this purpose without such a ,licence. Statistics. A summary of inspections made by the Housing Inspector is given in Table 18 on page 72 , and further housing statistics will be found on pages 69 and 70. 33 V. INSPECTION MP SUPERVISION OF FOOD. The work of the Food Section has proceeded on much the same lines this year as in the previous year, that is on the implementation of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. There is increasing co-operation between food traders desirous of opening new premises and the Public Health Inspectors, and it is usual for such traders to consult with the inspectors about hygiene requirements before construction or structural alterations to their premises takes place. If there has been any emphasis at all on any one aspect of the work, it is in connection with the bacteriological side of food inspection and it would appear that this is to be the trend for the future. Informal meetings took place at the Guildhall between the Medical Officers of Health of the Riparian Authorities, the Port Health Authority and the Ministry of Health, at which the Food Inspectors attended. There were discussions with the representatives of the importers and interested merchants on the problems arising from the import of foodstuffs which, for various reasons, were found not to comply with chemical or bacteriological standards. Two such meetings considered the contamination of Chinese dried hen egg albumen, liquid frozen egg and dried hen egg powder, samples of which had been found to contain bacteria of the Salmonella group, and, as a result, the heat treatment of all imports of egg albumen was introduced. At another meeting, discussion centred on the proposed amendments to the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations. These meetings are valuable because by pooling the experience and difficulties of the various authorities, which are often found to be similar, concerted efforts can be made to overcome them either by uniform procedure or by suggested amendments to legislation. Legislation during the year which affected the Food Section included the Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959, which re-enacted with amendments the 1944-1954 Regulations and which make itinerant sellers of milk no longer liable to registration. The Condensed Milk Regulations, 1959, amended and consolidated the 1923-1953 Regulations, and provide for the sale of half-cream condensed milk, requiring it to be labelled: "Should not be used for babies except under medical advice". A summary of the visits made by the Public Health (Food) Inspectors to food premises will be found on pages 71 and 72. Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs. Samples of food submitted for bacteriological examination numbered 72, details of which are as fallows:- 34  No, of Samples No.Unsatisfactory Observations Raw Milk 4 - Examination for tuberculosis by guinea pig inoculation. Pasteurised Milk 14 2 Subsequent samples satisfactory Canned Peaches 7 3 Examined to ascertain reason for blown tins. Part consignment condemned and destroyed. Canned Cooked Prawns 4 2 Do, Jellied Eels 3 1 Showed light growth of B.coli (faecal type). (See under). Roast Boof 2 2 Showed light growth of B.coli and B.proteus. Advised on food handling. Canned Pork 1 1 Showed growth of aerobic spore bearing bacilli and staphylococcus albus. Con.signment destroyed. Cooked Whelks 1 1 Showed light growth of B.coli and B.proteus. Prepared in another borough which investigated food handling methods. In two cases of alleged food poisoning occurring outside the Borough, jellied eels were suspected. In one case the jellied eels had been prepared in Stepney. Samples of the eels and of the gelatine used in their manufacture were f«und, on examination, to be satisfactory. In the other case it was found that the eels were supplied by a shop in the Borough, but had been prepared by a firm outside. A sample of these eels was examined and found to be contaminated by B.coli (faecal type), and the local authority of the area in which the eols had been prepared was accordingly notified. No adverse reports were received on the following samples examined:- Ice Cream 10 Liquid Gelatine 1 TT(Pasteurised) Milk A Seeded Raisins 3 Sterilised Milk 5 Hen Egg Powder 2 Quick Frozen Prawns 8 Canned Pears 2 Basement Bakehouses: Factories Act. 1957 - Section 5 A. The fourth quinquennial examination of basement bakehouses took place this year, and as a result the remaining five basement bakehouses 35 in the Borough, as listed below, were found not to be suitable as regards construction, light, height, ventilation and other hygienic respects. Accordingly the Council gave notice to the occupiers of these premises that the Certificates of Suitability issued under the Factory & Workshop Act, 1901, would cease to have effect after the expiration of twelve months from the date of the notices and that on expiry of the said period the bakehouse could not be used as such. The operative date of the notices is 31st July, I960 21, Brady Street. 134 & 136, Commercial Road. 3 & 5, Dock Street. 7, Hessel Street. 75/79, Wentworth Street. Subsequently the occupiers of two of the bakehouses - 3/5 Dock Street and 75/79, Wentworth Street, appealed against the notices. The occupier of 3/5, Dock Street later withdrew his appeal - the appeal by the occupier of 75/79, Wentworth Street being dismissed by the Magistrate. In consequence there will be no basement bakehouses operating in this Borough after 31st July, I960 - in which connection it is interesting to record that, in 1901, there were 93 basement bakehouses in the Borough. The basement bakehouse at 36, Cable Street was removed from the register, the premises having been out of use for over twelve months. Bakehouses and Bakers' Shoos. A summons was issued against the proprietor of a baker's shop for soiling a loaf of bread containing a nail, A fine of £10 and costs of £3.3.0d were imposed. Nine summonses issued with regard to dirty conditions in a bakehouse, resulted in the imposition of fines totalling £135 with costs of £10,10.0d. Chemical Sampling of Foodstuffs. Samples submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis number 412 for the year. The Report of the Public Analyst appears on pages 48-50. Export Certificates. Sixty-one certificates were issued in respect of the examination of a variety of foodstuffs being exported to the United States, South America, Canada, Sweden, Italy and Tripolitania. The issue of these certificates necessitater. inspection of the foodstuffs to be exported, and on occasion samples are taken for analysis before a certificate is issued. Investigation is made into the method of production, where necessary. 36 Ice Cream. Ten samples of ice-cream were subjected to the methylene blue reduction test, with the following results:- Manufactured Total In Borough: Outside Borough Grade I 2 (l) 8 (3) 10 (4) Grade II - (l) - (1) - (2) This is the first year that all samples taken have been in Grade I category. (The figures in parenthesis are those for 1958). Nine samples were submitted for chemical analysis and showed an average fat content of 11.54%. Although there are 28 premises registered in the Borough for the manufacture of ice-cream, only three were used for this purpose during the year. These were inspected from time to time under the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959, and no contravention of the regulations was found. The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1959, consolidate aiid amend the 1947-1952 Regulations and require that ingredients used in the manufacture of ice-cream are to be pasteurised by one or other of .three specific methods or are to be sterilised. The Regulations make it an offence to sell ice-cream which has not been so treated. The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959, prescribe amended standards for ice-cream and introduce separate standards for dairy ice-cream and for milk ice. Legal Proceedings. Summonses dealt with by the Public Health Inspectors (Food) during the year, were as follows:- No. of Summonses Fines Costs Food and Drugs Act, 1959 2 £15. 0. 0 £6. 11. 0 Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 9 £135. 0. 0 £10. 10. 0 11 £150. 0. 0 £17. 1. 0 Cautionary Letters. On the instructions of the Public Health Committee, cautionary letters were sent in respect of the following contraventions:- Sale of bread containing a paper label. Sale of pork sausages containing.220 parts per million sulphur dioxide (undeclared). 37 Milk Samples. Milk samples taken and submitted for chemical analysis during the year numbered 106, including nine taken at hospitals, schools and day nurseries in the Borough. The average fat and solids-not-fat content of milk samples analysed were as follows:- Solids-not-Fat Fat Content Ontont Channel Islands Milk 4.11% 8.61% Other Milk 3.67% 8.58% Public Health (imported Food.) Regulations, 1937-1948. Twohundred-and-twentysix Detention Notices and 206 Release Notices were served under the Regulations. These affected a variety of foodstuffs, including cocoa, chillies, cinnamon, coffee, coconut, assorted canned goods, dried fruits, egg, powder, ginger, gum arabic, ham, mutton, sugar and tea. Consignments of frozen meats, offals and sheeps casings which arrived unaccompanied by the official certificates, were either reexported or subsequently released on production of the certificates. Eighty-seven carcases of mutton, representing a 5 per cent examination, were examined for caseous lymphadenitis by the cutting of the lymphatic glands. All the carcases examined were found to be free from the disease. As from 1st January, 1959, the examination and sampling of tea imports at the wharves were transferred from H.M.Customs to the local riparian authorities, whose food inspectors acting under the Public Health (imported Food) Regulations, 1937, have, since that date, carried out these duties. This has meant a considerable increase in examination and sampling of tea at the six wharves and two bonded warehouses in the Borough, all of which accommodate very large quantities. Generally, sampling is carried out on special types of tea, e.g. Chinese and Japanese green teas, and tea containing jasmine flowers, and in respect of the retail sale of the latter- particular attention has been paid' to compliance with the Labelling of Food Order, so that there shall-be an indication on the packet that jasmine petals are contained in the tea. - Particular difficulty has been experienced in respect of excess of lead in Formosan black teas, samples of which have been found to contain more than the permitted limit of 10 parts per million. Where such excess has been found, the tea is released subject to it being blended with other teas so that the amount of lead in the resultant blend is within the permitted limit. 38 Unsound Food. The following quantities of unsound foodstuffs were disposed of during the year under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937-1948, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1936:- Tons Cwts Qrs Lbs Wharves 72 9 3 19 London Fruit Exchange and Spitalfields Market 96 - - 21 Bishopsgate Goods Stations ex Zeebrugge-Harwich Train Ferry 13 18 3 12 Non-Ferry Goods 4 4 2 23 Other Premises 54 - 2 11 240 14 1 2 Approximately 10 tons of unsound food was allowed to be used for animal feeding purposes, or for manufacturing purposes other than for human consumption, the remainder being delivered to, or collected by the Public Cleansing Department at whose riverside depot it was mixed with household refuse, under the supervision of the Public Cleansing Officer, and removed by barge to a controlled tipping site in Essex. Some 16 tons of damaged tea and tea sweepings was allowed to be exported to J«pan for industrial purposes. Approximately 2,500 Condemnation Certificates in respect of unsound food were issued in 1959. Zeebrugge-Harwich Train Ferry. 310 midnight or early morning visits and 131 other visits were made to Bishopsgate Goods Station for the purpose of examining 8,079 trucks of foodstuffs arriving from the following countries America 3 trucks. Germany 37 trucks Austria 1 " Greece 4 " Eelgian Congo 8 11 Holland 5 " Belgium 246 " Hungary 341 Bulgaria 158 " Italy 5,876 Denmark 1 " Spain 1 Ecuador 1 " Switzerland 68 France 3 " Yugoslavia 1,326 " The weight of the foodstuffs examined was 77,669 tons, comprising 58,336 tons of fresh fruit and vegetables, 11,786 tons canned meats and sausages, etc., 4,252 tons bacon, 1,236 tons butter, 84 tons confectionery, 910 tons canned fruits and vegetables, 434 tons frozen 39 39 meat and offals, 483 tons horsemeat, 49 tons cheese and 99 tons of miscellaneous foodstuffs. Foodstuffs found to be unsound, and which were stopped and destroyed, amounted to approximately 14. tons. Unsound Food, &c. - Complaints. Complaints made by members of the public as to the alleged unsound condition, etc. of food and which were investigated, during the year, numbered 39. The complaints referred to the following Alleged unsound condition. Breakfast oats 1, sausages 1, corned beef sandwiches 1, apple tarts 2, beef 1, pork 1, meat 1, jellied eels 1, melon 1, tinned salmon 1, tin of evaporated milk 1, bread and rolls 3, canned meat 1, mineral waters 2.

PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Weather Conditions. The year 1959 was notable for its wonderful sunny summer. The year started with a sunny January and ten of the twelve months had more than average sunshine. January was very sunny but cold with sleet and snow on four days. There was much frost during the month and the latter end was- foggy. February was remarkably dry, cold at first and mild later with three foggy days from the 17th. March and April were mild, with April rather wet. May and June were sunny, warm and dry except for occasional thunderstorms, and July was a lovely month, very hot and sunny. So was August, rain being confined to a few thunderstorms. The driest September on record followed with lots of sunshine, and October was exceptionally sunny and warm at first but cold later. November and December were mild, but the latter was very wet. Thus finished a year of unusually fine and sunny weather that more than made up for the dull wet summers of 1957 and 1958. Notifications. A total of 1,998 notifications of cases of infectious diseases were received during the year, compared with 881 in 1958, the difference being in the main measles notifications. The diagnosis was not confirmed in seven of the notifications. Table 19 on page 73.shows cases notified, together with comparative figures over the past 10 years. A list of diseases notifiable in the County of London is shown in Table 20 on page 74-• Cancer. Since 1951, the rate of deaths from lung cancer in the Borough has risen over 55 per cent whilst for cancer as a whole it has risen 9 per cent. The number of deaths from cancer of all sites of residents of the Borough, during the year, was 242, being 21 more than last year. Deaths from lung cancer numbered 77, which is 15 more than in 1958. The association between cancer of the lungs and smoking -leaves little doubt that smoking is a direct cause of lung cancer. A graph showing comparison between deaths from lung cancer and deaths from lung tuberculosis, over the past 10 years, will be found facing this page. 41 ACTUAL DEATHS FROM PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS & CANCER OF LUNG & BRONCHUS 1950- 1960 Diphtheria. Two notifications of Diphtheria were received during the year. The number of children immunised at London County Council clinics during the last 4 years, was as follows:- 1959 1958 1957 1956 Completed primary course:- Children under 5 years 1330 1106 1147 1761 Children 5 to 15 years 318 420 415 439 Children given a secondary injection 940 1372 1437 1563 An outbreak which occurred in a London borough in December resulted in the attendance for immunisation at clinics in the area increasing fivefold. Young parents who have little fear or knowledge of the seriousness of the disease must realise the need to have their children immunised. Onehundred-and-four swabs were forwarded by general practitioners to the Mile End Group Laboratory, where bacteriological examinations are carried out on behalf of the Borough Council. Dysentery. There was a decrease in the incidence of Sonne Dysentery, 87 cases having been notified compared with 145 cases last year. The occurrence of Sonne Dysentery is common, but seldom fatal, and then only in aged persons or debilitated children. Enteric Fever. Two cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year. One case notified by a military doctor as enteric fever concerned a young soldier aged 16 recently returned from France and Germany, the causal organism found being stated to be Salmonella Typhi-murium. The other case, a man aged 31, had been a resident of a common lodging house. He made a rapid recovery but one stool was found positive for Paratyphoid-B. Erysioolas. During the year thirteen notifications were received. Food Poisoning. There were 8 cases of notified Food Poisoning, which were unconnected with each other, except two viz. a grandmother and grandchild. The likely cause of infection in the one fatal case was a hen's egg, eaten raw in vinegar, obtained from a friend who had brought it froa the 42 country some three days previously. It was not possible to trace the source. Typhi'-murium was recovered from the faeces and also from the gall-bladder post mortem. The cases are summarised belows- Date of Onset, Sex and Age Organism found Food suspected 12 Feb. 1959 Female, 72 (Grandmother) Typhi- murium Fried Fish. : 9 March, 1959 Male, 11/12 (Grandchild) Typhi- murium (stools). - 14 May, 1959 Female, 26 None found. Jellied Eels. 12 Aug. 1959 Female, 71 None found. - 14 Aug.1959 Male, 5½ Typhi- murium (stools). Tinned Peas. 5 Aug. 1959 Male, 9 None found. Raw Apples. 18 Aug. 1959 Male, 14½ Typhi- murium (stools) Not known. 14 Oct. 1959 Female, 79 (Died 20/10/59) Typhi- murium (stools, gallbladder). Raw egg in vinegar. Malaria. No cases of Malaria were notified during the year. Measles. Notifications of Measles in the Borough numbered 1,344, compared with 199 last year. There were no deaths from the disease. Epidemics tend to recur at intervals of just under two years. 43 Meningococcal Infectien. There were two notifications (the lowest for 10 years) during the year, compared with three notifications last year. Ophthalmic. Neonatorum. There was one case notified this year, the lowest ever. Poliomyelitis. Nine notifications of poliomyelitis were received (8 paralytic and one non-paralytic) but the diagnosis was confirmed in only seven cases (6 paralytic and one non-paralytic). In April the death from poliomyelitis of a prominent football player received wide press and radio publicity, and, as a result, for some days afterwards the telephone switchboard of the Department was kept extremely busy with members of the public enquiring how soon and where they could be vaccinated. The proprietors of some local firms made arrangements to have their staffs vaccinated. Vaccination against poliomyelitis is carried out by the Divisional Health Department of the London County Council. Provision was first made for children, young persons and expectant mothers, a primary and secondary injection being given in each case. Vaccination will now be extended to all persons up to the age of 40 years. Puerperal Pyrexia. There were 58 notifications during the year, compared with 26 in 1958. Of these, 22 were residents of the Borough. Scabies. Scabies is still notifiable under the County of London (Scabies) Regulations, 1943• The number of cases formally notified was 49 compared with 53 last year. Seventy-one scabies patients and contacts were treated by medicinal baths at Branch Road Treatment Centre and their clothing disinfested, viz:- Males Females Children 32 27 12 The number of baths given during the year totalled 92. Scarlet Fever. There were 59 cases notified and no deaths from the disease. 44 Smallpox. * No cases of Smallpox were notified during the year and it was not necessary for me to take action under the Public Health (Smallpox) Regulations, 1917. Frequent notifications are received from Port and Airport Authorities of persons coming into the Borough who may have been in contact with smallpox. Observation for the necessary period is kept on such persons by officers of the Public Health Department, The number of children successfully vaccinated or re-vaccinated against smallpox at London County Council clinics, during the year, was 888. Tuberculosis. The number of primary notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis received was 135 compared with 136 last year, and the number of non-pulmonary cases notified was 14 compared with 9 last year. The mortality rate for the year for pulmonary tuberculosis was 17 and for non-pulmonary nil per 100,000 population, compared with 15 and nil respectively in 1958. (For details of register and notifications see page 75). Onehundred-and-fiftyfive visits were paid by the Public Health Inspectors to the homes of persons suffering from tuberculosis and appropriate action taken where public health nuisances were found to exist. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925, These Regulations provide that persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract shall not be employed in the handling of milk or milk receptacles. Power is given to the Council to cause such persons to discontinue their employment. It was not found necessary during the year to take action under the Regulations. Tuberculosis Care Committee. The Tuberculosis Care Committee' on which are represented voluntary and official bodies, and whose meetings are attended by the Medical Officer of Health, continues to supply help to tuberculous persons and to relatives who require assistance which cannot be obtained from official sources, or where urgency or special circumstances indicate that the voluntary sources of the Care Committee are preferable. Although tuberculosis is slowly but surely being conquered, the public should realise that much help is still needed to be given to persons suffering from the disease. 45 Help was given during the year to 53 persons by way of clothing, furnishings, fuel, grants towards debts, and fares to relatives visiting patients in sanatoria. The Care Committee again provided a day's coach outing to the sea for 31 patients and Christmas gifts for 53 patients. The Annual Christmas Seal Sale Fund amounted to £182 and this was supplemented by donations from various organisations, for which the Care Committee is most grateful. Where possible grants were obtained from statutory and voluntary funds, but where these could not be obtained the funds of the Committee were used. The Occupational Therapy Scheme was in abeyance this year, as the therapist had resigned and no replacement could be found because of the shortage of workers in this field. Whooping Cough. Seventy-six cases were notified during the year, the figure for 1958 being 36. There were no deaths from the disease. Infectious Disease Contacts. Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with.an infectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1946, are paid only on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was found necessary to issue one Such certificate during the year. Section 26 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, provides that when a Medical Officer of Health requests in writing a person to discontinue his employment with a view to preventing the spread of infectious disease, the Council may if they think fit compensate such person for any loss occasioned by his compliance with that request. Authentication of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. A person proceeding abroad is required in certain countries to produce a certificate of recent successful vaccination and inoculation, and, in addition, the signature of the vaccinating doctor must be verified by the Medical Officer of Health of the district. The signatures on 64.7 such certificates were verified, during the year, as those of medical practitioners practising in Stepney and the certificates were endorsed accordingly. Disinfection. Premises disinfected because of infectious disease numbered 76, which included seven for pulmonary tuberculosis. 5,555 articles of clothing and bedding were steam disinfected, including 1,023 articles for export for whieh seven certificates were issued. 46 Formaldehyde disinfection of 146,091 articles of clothing and 30 tons of wastepaper for export was also carried out during the year, for which 168 certificates were issued. The charges for export and other disinfections carried out amounted to £90. Disinfestation (bed bugs and other insect pests). The following is a summary of work carried out by the Specialist Inspector engaged on disinfestation duties General inspections for vermin 1,077 Attempted visits 146 Number of premises found verminous 493 " " revisits 104 " 11 miscellaneous visits 343 " " rooms sprayed 1,567 " " premises sprayed 745 In addition, disinfestation by steam and formaldehyde was carried out on 64 occasions of the furniture and effects of families rehoused by the London County Council. Many treatments were also carried out for infestations of cockroaches, beetles, ants, silverfish and the like. Commencing this year, the Council has undertaken at the request of the Stepney Group Hospital Management Committee to carry out any necessary work of disinfestation at hospitals and other premises in the Borough coming within the control of that Committee. Verminous Persons. The number of lice-infested persons bathed and whose clothing was disinfested at Branch Road Cleansing Station, was as follows Males Females Children 228 31 5 Totals 264 The number of baths and treatments given amounted to 273. 47 SUMMARY OF PUELIC ANALYST'S QUARTERLY REPORTS for the year 1959. The following is a summary of the reports submitted each quarter of the year, in compliance with Section 99 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, by the Council's Public Analyst, Mr.D.F.H.Button, A.R.C.S., F.R.I.C., of Southwark Health Services Department, Walworth Road, S.E.17. A copy of each quarterly report is submitted to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in accordance with the same section of the Act. During the year 412 samples were submitted for analysis, 102 of whicl were purchased or taken formally and 310 informally.
