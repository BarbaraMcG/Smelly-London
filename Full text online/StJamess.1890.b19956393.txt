In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the following Report of their proceedings and an abstract of their accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during that time, and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year. 1890. With a view to affording the ratepayers as complete a knowledge as possible of the administration of parochial affairs generally, the Vestry again append to their Report, Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians of the Westminster Union, the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the Trustees of Charitable Endowments in which the parish is interested. 14 THE PARISH. Extent.—The Parish occupies an area of 164 acres. It has about 12½ miles of streets, of which miles are paved with wood, 5¼ with asphalte, f with pitching, with macadam, and 1½ mile consists of courts, yards, and passages. Population.—At the last census, which was taken in April, 1881, the resident population was ascertained to be 29,865 persons, and the number of occupied houses 3,018. In this enumeration, however, no account is taken of the large number of persons who are engaged in the Parish during the day, and reside away from their places of business. Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on page 17. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union; it is also a constituent part of the Central London Sick Asylum District. Wards.—The Parish has been divided into four wards for the election of Vestrymen, and this division is followed in the preparation of the Lists of Voters for Member of Parliament, the County Council, and School Board. The name of the ward is printed on the rate receipt of each ratepayer. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been sub-divided into five districts, the mother church being St. James's, Piccadilly, of which the Rev. J. E. Kempe, M.A., is Rector. 15 Representation in Parliament.—The Parish of St James was formerly comprised in the Parliamentary Borough of the City of Westminster, which returned two members to Parliament; it now, however, fonns a part of the Borough of Strand, which returns one member, the present representative being the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith. The Register prepared in 1890 contains the names of 4,294 Parliamentary electors, viz., 4 on the Scot and Lot List, 30*2 Lodgers, and 3,988 possessing other qualifications. There are also 579 County Electors who have been placed on the Register under the Local Government Act, 1888, but are not qualified to vote for members of Parliament. Parliamentary voters for the County of Middlesex, in respect of property situate wholly or in part in the Parish St. James, number 180. By the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of the School Board for London. Five members of the School Board are elected by the ratepayers of the Division. Water Supply.—Four Companies supply the Parish with water, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being as follows:— 1. Chelsea Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 35, Commercial Road, Pimlico). So much of the Parish as lies to the south of the centre of Pall Mall and Cleveland Row. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1722. 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.V So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running at the back of the east side of Poland Street, Lexington 16 Street, Great Windmill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1619. 3. Grand Junction Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 65, South Molton Street). So much of the Parish as lies to the west of the district supplied by the New River Company and the north of the centre of Pall Mall. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1811. 4. West Middlesex Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as is situate within the Parish. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in the year 1806. The rates of charge for a supply of water for domestic purposes authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several above-mentioned Companies are almost identical, the scale being as follows:— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per cent, per annum; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent, per annum. An additional charge, varying from 4s. per annum where the annual value of the house exceeds £30 but is less than £50, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water-closet, fixed bath, or high service; for each additional water-closet, fixed bath, or high service, half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation of more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. 17 (gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). The Coroner is Mr. John Troutbeck, whose jurisdiction extends throughout-the City and Liberties of Westminster. For the Registration of Births and Deaths the Parish is included in the Westminster District The SubRegistrar is Mr. Thomas Matthew Crowe, of 31, Wardour Street ; and the Superintendent Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond, Union Offices, Poland Street. THE VESTRY, as now constituted under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, consists of 48 elected and three ex-officio members, the latter being the Rector and Churchwardens. It superseded a Vestry elected under the provisions of a permissive statute, 1 & 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers of St. James's on the 6th April, 1832. This elected Vestry had, in its turn, superseded a select Vestry established by the Act under which the Parish was created in 1685. The select Vestry was virtually a self-appointed body, vacancies being tilled up by the surviving members. Neither the ancient select Vestry nor the Vestry elected under the statute of 1831 had any jurisdiction over the paving or drainage of the Parish. Each of these matters was under the control of a separate and distinct body of Commissioners. The Act of 1855 transferred to the Vestry, as now constituted, not only all the powers of the earlier Vestry, but also those relating to paving, drainage, and lighting formerly exercised by these Commissioners. Sub- b 18 sequent legislation has laid upon the Vestry various additional duties, and, in many respects, the powers of the Vestry within the area of its jurisdiction resemble those of the town council of a corporate town, with further rating powers, although as regards the police force, the provision of markets, and the supply of gas and water, not this Parish alone, but the metropolis at large, stands on a different footing from provincial towns of comparatively minor importance. The following pages will show the diversity of subjects coming within the purview of the Vestry, but it may be convenient here to enumerate the more important functions of that body, viz.:— (1) Paving, cleansing, watering, and lighting the public streets. (2) Constructing, maintaining, and cleansing local sewers, public conveniences, &c. (3) Supervising the construction, alteration, and amendment of the drains and sanitary arrangements of dwelling-houses and other buildings. (4) Preventing, removing, and abating nuisances injurious to health, disinfecting after sickness, &c. (5) Regulating projections into the public streets, and annoyances of various kinds. (C) Preserving as far as possible, freedom from adulteration in articles of food and medicine. 10 (7) Levying and collecting the rates, from which large and, unfortunately, rapidly increasing, sums are paid annually to authorities entirely independent of local control. Upon the last-mentioned point it may be here observed that there has been a growing tendency for some years to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes. Thus since the year 1S55 the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main Drainage: (b) Fire Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges—purchase, maintenance, and rebuilding; (e) Artizans' Dwellings, and other purposes. The extent to which this operates upon local rates will be seen on reference to the statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for metropolitan purposes, which is given on page 35. THE ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS Was held on Monday, the 19th day of May, the places appointed for the purpose being—Pall Mall Ward, United Hotel, Charles Street; Church Ward Vestry Hall, Piccadilly; Golden Square Ward, Craven Hall, Marshall Street; and Great Marlborough Ward, Board Room, Poland Street. The total expense of conducting the elections amounted to £4 14s. 6d., and an order for the payment of this sum from the Poor Rate was made by the Vestry in accordance with the statute. A list of the Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts wilI: found on pages 7 and 8. B 2 20 VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The following is the number of meetings held during the year:— Vestry Meetings 31 Finance and House Committee 21 Sanitary, Parliamentary Bills, and General Purposes Committee 23 Works and Improvements Committee 26 Sanitary and Works Committees (Joint) 1 Lighting Committee 11 St. James's Dwellings Committee 11 Valuation List and other Special and SubCommittees 12 Total 136 The Vestry usually meet on alternate Thursday mornings, but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of five members, and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Four StandingCommittees are appointed annually, in accordance with the bye-laws of the Vestry, and meet as frequently as occasion may require. Special Committees are appointed from time time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. Vestry Clerk s Department.—The staff has been increased by the appointment of a junior clerk, at a commencing salary of £20 a year. 21 Sanitary Department.—In the month of January, this department was reorganised, and the senior Inspector was placed in charge of the whole Parish, under the designation of Chief Inspector, with the junior officer to act under his direction. At Lady-day, however, this arrangement was under consideration, in consequence of the resignation of the Assistant Inspector. rate Collectors.—The vacancy caused by the death of Mr. J. J. Johnson, to which reference was made in last year's report, was filled up by the appointment of Mr. John Taylor, of 44, Brewer Street. Generally.—The salaries of one or two of the officers have been increased. A list of the officers of the Vestry and their respective salaries is given on pages 139 and 140. NEW BYE-LAW. A new bye-law was made by the Vestry on the 10th April,and duly confirmed at a subsequent meeting as follows: Any two Members may interrupt a debats at any time by moving and seconding without remark, "That the question be now put," and the Chairman (unless be consider the motion an abuse of this rule) shall thereupon call upon such of the Members present as are in favour of the closing of the debate to rise in their places. If onethird of the Members present so rise, the Chairman shall forthwith put to the vote the motion "That the question be now put," and in the event of such motion being carried in the affirmative by a majority of the votes of the Members present, he shall put to the vote, without further remark or debate, the motion or amendment which was ulder conaideratiou when the motion, "That the question be now put," was moved. 22 STANDING ORDERS.

The gentlemen chosen from this list, and appointed by the 24 Justices of the Peace, at a Petty Sessions held on the 11th April, to act as Overseers for the year 1890-1, were :— Mr. Frederick Glover, 30, Beak Street. Mr. Alfred Court, 46, Poland Street. Mr. Kenneth McDonald, 64, Haymarket. Mr. Henry James Saunders, 27, Beak Street. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. The Act to encourage the establishment of Public Baths and Washhouses was adopted by the Vestry in the same year that it became law, 1846. The Act is not administered by the Vestry, but by seven Commissioners appointed by them. The Commissioners are largely independent of the Vestry, but have to obtain their consent to contracting loans, and also to expenditure in certain cases. They are not required to periodically report their proceedings to the Vestry, although it has become their practice of late yearn for them to present a report annually. The statement of the Commissioners for the past year shows a slight decrease, both as regards the number of persons using the establishment and the receipts. This decrease the Commissioners account for by the prevalence of cold and wet weather during the busier months. The following extracts are given from the Annual Report of the Commissioners, which was presented to the Vestry in January:— The increase in the normal cost of the establishment is due wholly to the two items of fuel and water, from circumstances wholly beyond the control of the Commissioners. When the contract for coal was taken in 1888, the accepted tender was at the rate of 16s. 3d. per ton. In the meantime the duty of 13d. per ton, which. 25 was then levied on all coal entering London, hat been allowed to lapse, the advocates of abolition arguing that the disappearance of the duty would cause a diminution in the price of coal not only by the amount of the duty but also by some further sum due to competition resulting from the introduction of an inferior quality coal which it had not hitherto paid to bring to London, but which was said to be suitable for certain purpose. These anticipations, however, have not been realised, for the contract price for coal instead of being less than in 1888 is now 21s. 9d. or actually 5s. 6d. per ton more than then. As the consumption of coal exceeds 500 tons a year, this increase is a Serious item. With regard to water also, the Commissioners have been called npon to pay a largely increased price. For many years the Grand Junction Water Works Company supplied the establishment with water, irrespective of quantity, for the sum of £150 a year, in accordance with what the Commissioners conceive to be the intention of the Legislature (9 and 10 Vic., Cap. 74, Sec. 28). Unfortunately, however, the law enabling Water Companies to supply public Baths and Washhouses with water on special terms is only permissive, and when the Grand Junction Water Company terminated the former arrangement and increased their charge to 6d. per 1,000 gallons, the Commissioners were power less in the matter. The Water Company will receive about £200 a year additional from the baths owing to this revision of price. Probably the supply of water will be transferred from commercial companies to a public body at no distant date, when water for public purposes, at bare cost, will form a considerable indirect benefit of the change. Failing such transfer, it may possibly prove economical for the Commissioners to sink a well and obtain at any rate a portion of their supply independently of the company. With a view to some further economy in the administration of the establishment, the Commissioners have accepted a tender for the re-arrangement of the bath money-takers' offices, by which it will be possible to dispense with the services of one of the moneytakers. The amount of the tender is £120, and the annual saving will be £46. The recent arrangement with the vestry for washing the towels used in the lavatories at Piccadilly Circus will also tend to economy by more fully utilising the services of the staff on days when the baths are less frequented. 26 The proposed construction of a new Swimming Bath for first-class bathers of both sexes has so recently been before the Vestry as to need little more than passing mention. It may, however, be useful briefly to detail the action taken by the Commissioners in the matter before they submitted to the Vestry their recent scheme or utilising the sites of Nos. 14 and 15, Marshall Street, for the purpose. It will be within the recollection of tbe Vestry that on the 30th January, 1890, a resolution was passed assenting to the Commissioners appropriating the site of Nos. 19 to 23, Marshall Street, to the erection of a new first-class swimming bath, subject to the assent of the Local Government Board, following upon a previous resolution (7th November, 1889), authorising the Commissioners to negotiate with the Guardians of the Poor of the Westminster Union for the surrender of No. 19. Marshall Street, which they hold under an order of the Local Government Board. The Commissioners had lost no time in approaching the Guardians, and nothing could be more cordial than the interchange of opinions at, a personal interview between the two bodies. The Commissioners left under the impression that the Guardians recognised the public benefit which would result from the establishment of the proposed new swimming bath, and would further the object to the utmost of their power, their only stipulation being that accommodation should be found for the nurses occupying No. 19, Marshall Street, and this impression was confirmed by a subsequent letter from the Guardians. The Commissioners suggested that a reduction in the rent payable to the Parish of St. James, proportionate to the value of the property to be surrendered, would seem to afford the easiest solution of the question, as the Guardians would then be free to adopt any course they pleased, but in case the Guardians should prefer the Commissioners making structural alterations in the Workhouse to accommodate the four or five displaced nurses, several alternative rearrangements of portions of the Workhouse premises for the accommodation of the nurses were submitted. And seeing that the Guardians have sufficient room to receive paupers from other unions, it appeared that some such course could have been adopted without difficulty. It was, therefore, with a feeling of intense disappointment that in the month of April the Commissioners received a letter from the Guardians, stating that the only condition upon which No. 19, Marshall Street, would be surrendered was the purchase of the 27 freehold of 48, Poland Street, for the Guardians at the expense of the Commissioners. As the house in Poland Street affords considerably more accommodation than that in Marshall Street, and is probably, five times its value, the Commissioners did not feel justified in proceeding further in the matter, and with some reluctance abandoned their original scheme. The Commissioners then turned their attention to building on the site of the houses to the south of the baths, and having visited all the more modern public swimming baths in London, adopted the general design of the Marylebone bath as most suitable for the suggested new site. Provisional plans and drawings were then prepared by the Vestry's Surveyor, under the direction of the Commissioners, and in due course submitted to and approved by the Vestry. As the matter now stands, the Vestry have approved of the appropriation of the site of Nos. 14 and 15, Marshall Street, for the erection of a swimming bath for first-class bathers of both sexes, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board. The bath, it is estimated, will cost less than £6,000 completed, including all professional charges; the water service will be about 62ft. by 23ft., and a superficial area beneath a portion of the bath of nearly 2,000 feet be added to the stoneyard. The Commissioners anticipate that the construction of the bath and the enlargement of the stoneyard will prove a considerable boon to the pariah, and as £3,000 is in hand available for the work, and the remaining £3,000 is to be borrowed and the repayment spread over a period of ten years, the additional burden to the ratepayers individually will be almost infinitesimal. There can also be no doubt that a considerable revenue is yearly lost in consequence of the very inadequate swimming bath accommodation provided for bathers of the better class, which the Commissioners hope to be in a position to properly supplement during the current year. The number of bathers last year(102,466) Show a falling off of 2,300 compared with the previous year, but an increa.se of nearly 5,(KM) compared with the year 1888. The number of tickets issued for the laundry shows a decline of 187. As to the laundry, the Vestry desire to emphasize the following remarks of the Commissioners :— The Commissioners would again impress upon all who art brought into close contact with the labouring classes the immense con- 28 venience afforded by the Washhouses at a minimum of cost, and the ready help thus at hand to remove the discomforts of washing-day in a home of one or two rooms. The proposal to construct a new swimming bath for firstclass bathers is noticed at length in the extract from the Report of the Commissioners which is given above. The matter formed the subject of an inquiry by J. T. Harrison, Esq., one of the Inspectors of the Local Government Board, on the 20th March, but the decision of the Board had not been received at Lady-day. Two Commissioners (Mr. W. Jenkins and Mr. Pool) retired by effluxion of time in January. Mr. Jenkins was reelected for the usual term of office, and Mr. Peyton was elected in the place of Mr. Pool, who had expressed a desire to be relieved of the office. A vote of thanks to Mr. Pool for his public services in the Parish, extending over many years, coupled with an expression of the hope of the Vestry that they might long benefit by his experience in their deliberations, was unanimously passed. A list of the Commissioners is given on page 11, and a statement of their receipts and expenditure for the year 1890, and the number of bathers and washers, on pages 152 and 153. ARCHBISHOP TENISON'S SCHOOL. Three of the Trustees of Archbishop Tenison's United Schools for the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St. James are elected by the Vestry. A vacancy occurred during the year by the expiration of the term for which Mr. Winnett had been elected, and was filled up by the unanimous re-appointment of that gentleman. A statement of the Accounts of the Schools for the year 1890 is given on page 155. 20 BURLINGTON SCHOOL This School is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in the year 1875, and two of the Governors are elected by the Vestry. The present representative Governors are Mr. F. H. Bingham and Mr. Joseph Pool. The school fees, which are payable in advance at the commencement of each term, are as follows :— Entrance, .1b. for one pupil, and 2s. 6d. for each additional pupil from the same family. Tuition for a pupil entering the school above the age of 10 years, £1 10s. 0d. per term. If more than one pupil from the same family, £1 5s. 0d. for each beyond the first. For a pupil entering the school under the age of 10 years, £1 5s. 0d. per term, so long as she shall continue in the school. Dinners are supplied at 7d. each, or 2s. 0d. for the week of five days. Application for admission should he made to the Head Mistress at the School House, Old Burlington Street, where particulars of the course of study may be obtained. A statement of the Accounts of the School for the year 1890 is given on page 156. THE CRAVEN PEST HOUSE CHARITY. Five Parishes participate ill the benefits of this Chanty, viz., St Martin-in-the-Fields, St George, Hanover Square, St, Clement Danes, St. Paul, Covent Garden, and St James. Formerly four of the Trustees were appointed by the Charity Commissioners on the nomination of the Vestry, but under a 30 recent order of the Commissioners vacancies are filled up by the Trustees themselves. The surviving Trustees appointed by the Vestry under the former practice are Mr. F. Crane, Mr. J. Bonthron, and Mr. W. Winnett. The income of the Charity is applied, under an order of the Court of Chancery, to the maintenance of 24 beds in King's College Hospital and 16 in Charing Cross Hospital, for the reception of poor patients from the five parishes mentioned. The hospitals are also required to afford outtreatment to all poor persons resident in any of the five parishes, who may be sent by the Trustees. A copy of the Accounts of the Charity for the year 1890 is given on page 157. MRS. ANN NEWTON'S CHARITY. This Charity, for the apprenticing of one poor boy of St. James's annually from the Union School, which was formerly administered by the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor, has owing to the abolition of that Board, been placed, by an order of the Charity Commissioners, dated the 15th August, 1890, under the management of the Guardians of the Poor elected for this Parish. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1890 is given on page 160. LE QUAINTER'S CHARITY. The only Charity which is administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter s It arises from a bequest, in 1782, by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly, who directed that the income should be "equally distributed at Christmas amongst twenty poor persons :u who are or have been housekeepers in the Pariah of St. James, Westminster, and such the the Rector and Churchwardens, and the other gentlemen for the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish, shall deem to be proper objects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." The property of the Charity consists of £9,969 2s. 9d. Two and Three-quarters per Cent Annuities. A statement of the Accounts for the past year is given on page 159. ST. MARTIN'S ALMSHOUSE AND PENSIONS CHARITY. This Charity is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in 1886, the governing body comprising ex-officio, co-optative, and representative Trustees. Two of the latter are elected by the Vestry of this Parish, the present representatives being Mr. Morle and Mr. Winnett. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1890 will be found on pages 164 to 167. OTHER PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. A list of other endowed Charities in which the Parish is interested is given on pages 168 to 175, and statements of the accounts on pages 158 to 163. FINANCIAL Formerly payments from the Poor Rate were made, on the order of the Governors and Directors of the Poor, but on the abolition of that body at Lady-day, 1890, the 32 administration of the Poor Rate was transferred to the Vestry. In consequence of this change in practice, the Vestry now have the oversight of the whole late expenditure of the Parish, although, as regards the Poor Rate, by far the greater portion is paid away in large sums to other bodies altogether independent of the Vestry. Poor Rate.—This Account commenced with a cash balance in hand amounting to £3,008 6s. 3d., the receipts during the year amounted to £88,978 6s. l1d., and expenditure to £93,091 5s., leaving a balance of £1,104 l1s. l0d. due to the Treasurer at the close of the account at Lady-day. At the last-mentioned date both the assets and liabilities on this Account were unimportant in amount. Sewers and General Rate.—It will be seen on reference to the Accounts, commencing on page 132, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurer's hands . amounting to £13,077 12s. 4d. The sum of £62,473 15s. 2d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period reached a total of £57,998 12s. l1d., leaving a balance of £17,552 14s. 7d., on the 25th March, 1891. Against this cash balance, however, there were, on the last mentioned date, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £12,851 17s. 1d., with assets (exclusive of cash balance) estimated to realise £2,367 5s., leaving a surplus of £7,068 2s. 6d. to be carried to the credit of the present year. LOANS. A statement of the Loan now outstanding is given on page 143. 33 RATEABLE VALUE. Under the provisions of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act 1869, the whole of the rateable properties in the Parish were re-valued during the year. At the general revaluation which took place in the year 1885, the assessment was follows:— Gross value £831,835 Rateable value £694,201 The total of the Valuation Lists upon the recent revision (subject to appeal) is as follows :— Gross value £889,649 Rateable value £743,348 showing an increase upon the five years of £57,814 in the Gross and £49,147 in the Rateable value. The average annual increase in the assessment during the past four years, owing to the erection of new buildings and additions to existing buildings was £6,709 Gross and £5,439 Rateable value. The increase during the past year, owing partly to the erection of new buildings and partly to the revision of assessments generally was £30,976 on the Gross value and £27,390 on the Rateable value. The valuation of the properties was made without the assistance of a professional valuer, and the total expense incurred by the Vestry, including printing, service of notices, &c. was £158 4s. 7d. In order to afford the parishioners every opportunity of appeal, a notice of the intended assessment was served upon every ratepayer, whether it was proposed to make any alteration therein or not, with a headline in red ink calling c 34 attention to the importance of the notice and to the fact that the assessment then to be made would continue in force for five years. The number of appeals, however, was not unusually numerous. RATES were made by the Vestry during the year as follows Amount in the Pound. Poor Rate (including, in addition to charges for the Relief of the Poor, Police Rate, expenses of the London County Council, contributions to the s. d Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges) 2 6 General Rate for the lighting, maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, and precepts of the School Board of London 1 7 Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 0 1 Total 4 2 The rates for each of the two previous years were 3s. 9d. and 3s. l1d. in the pound respectively. The following statement shows the amount of the rates and the collection thereof:— Poor Rate:— £ s. d. Amount of rate as levied 88,401 7 6 Arrears of former rates 953 1 9 Rates on property assessed during the year 527 8 6 £89,881 17 9 Collected 86,029 4 3¾ Loss from empty houses, &c. 2,256 0 1 Arrears at close of year 1,596 13 4¼ £89,881 17 9 :*5 Other Parochial Rates:— £ s. d.

For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. In view of the increasing demands by Central Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry does not possess any control, although for economy in collection the funds are raised with the local rates, the following statement will be of interest to ratepavers :— Total amount expended, Under control of Local Authority. £150,995 Of. 10d.

It will be seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £108,671 0s. l0d. of the total of £156,995 6s. l0d. having been paid over during the year to various authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. In other words, out of every shilling raised as local rates in St. James's, less than fourpence is spent by the Parochial Authorities. *Including final precept for three months to Lady-day, 1889, making in all five quarters' expenses levied in one year. The duties of the Metropolitan Board of Works are now performed by the London County Council. † Including expenses formerly paid by Metropolitan Board of Works. 37 COUNTY COUNCIL RATE. As some misapprehension appears to exist with regard to the rate levied for the London County Council, it may perhaps, be as well to explain that the Council have superseded two bodies, that is, the Metropolitan Board of Works, and, for administrative purposes, the Justices of the Peace for the portions of Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey, now included in the County of London. The rate levied by the Metropolitan Board of Works was uniform throughout the Metropolis, but the county rate levied by the Justices in Middlesex was lower than that levied by the Justices in Surrey and Kent, consequently the ratepayers in London south of the Thames have benefitted slightly by the amalgamation of the county charges. In comparing the rate levied for the County Council, with that of their predecessors, therefore, the county rate levied by the Justices as well as the rate levied by the Metropolitan Board of Works, must be reckoned. Nor must the re-arrangement of the burden of taxation, resulting from the expiration of the Coal Dues and the alteration in the method of making contributions from Imperial funds in aid of the local rates and in the amount of these contributions, be overlooked. For general purposes, the Coal Dues ceased to be available in July, 1888, and under the Local Government Act, 1888, Exchequer contributions of about £600,000 per annum were replaced by the proceeds of a proportion of the English probate duty and of certain licence fees, together amounting (for London) to about £800,000 a year, or about £200,000 more than the Exchequer contributions. On the other hand, the Council are called upon to make a new payment 38 to Guardians of the Poor of 4d. per day for each indoor pauper. This payment represents about £320,000 a year and largely benefits those parishes which have a large number of indoor poor and a small rateable value. Parishes like St. James's, with a small number of indoor poor and a large rateable value, draw less from the fund than they contribute to it. To illustrate the working of this fund, it may be stated that £320,000 a year represents a rate on London generally of about 2½d. in the pound, while St. George's-in-the-East receives from it a sum equivalent to a rate exceeding 1s. in the pound on that parish. There are thus so many considerations entering into the question, that it is difficult to make a fair general comparison between the rate levied by the County Council and that levied by their predecessors. For this Parish, however, the following would appear to be the result:— s. d. County Council Rate, 1890-1 1 1¼ Less—Payment to Guardians, equivalent to a rate of 0 1¼ 1 0 d. Metropolitan Board of Works Rate 2½d. for three months to Lady-day, 1889, equal to, for the year 10 County and Lunatic Asylum Rates 1¼ 11¼ d. Increase ¾ 39 This increase would have been greater hut for the Council receiving £200,000 a year more from the Probate Duty and Licences than was formerly paid by way of Exchequer contributions, and the rate would have shown a decrease, but for the pauper-grant fund. In some parishes, owing to the operation of the paupergrant fund, the County Council rate shows a decrease compared with the rates which it has replaced. INCREASE IN RATES. On the 10th July, a deputation of ratepayers waited upon the Vestry with reference to the continuous increase in the rates. The causes of this increase have on many occasions occupied the attention of the Vestry, for it is most discouraging to find that all the efforts which are made to economically administer local funds are more than counterbalanced by the growing expenditure of central bodies for whom the Vestry are required to provide funds without possessing any control over the expenditure thereof. The deputation referred to the difference in the amount of the rates in the year 1861 jus compared with the year 1890. This comparison between the present and a time before the establishment of the School Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, the formation of the Common Poor Fund, and other legislative enactments which have proved so costly to West-end parishes, evinced so strange a misconception of the facts of the case as to lead the Vestry to issue an explanatory statement, not in their own justification, but for the information of the ratepayers. A copy of this was sent to each ratepayer, but a reference here to its more salient features may not be inappropriate. 40 It was shown that in the year 1856, the first year of the Vestry as reconstituted under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the first year also of the existence of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the rates for this Parish amounted to 3s. in the pound. In 1861, the year mentioned by the deputation, the rates were 2s. l1d. in the pound. In 1889, the last completed year when the statement was prepared, they were 3s. l1d. in the pound, and in 1890 they were 4s. 2d. in the pound. But since 1856, the following legislation has largely affected this parish, owing to its high rateable value:— Main Drainage Act, 1858, authorizing a rate not exceeding 3d. in the pound. Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, transferring certain sewers debts from localities to the Metropolis. Metropolitan Houseless Poor Act, 1864, making the relief of casual poor a Metropolitan instead of a local charge. Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act, 1865, authorizing a rate of ½d. in the pound. Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, resulting in the establishment of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, the incorporation of St. Anne's with St. James's for poor-law purposes, and the establishment of the Central London Sick Asylum. This Act costs the parish nearly £20,000 a year, or a rate of nearly 7d. in the pound. 41 Thames Bridges Act, 1869. Elementary Education Act, 1870. The School Board rate is now l1d. in the pound. Local Government Act, 1888, which still further equalizes the poor rate of London by requiring the County Council to pay to the Guardians 4d. per head per day for indoor paupers. The Coal Dues, which realized £350,000 a year, were allowed to lapse in 1889, and the deficiency is made up by the rates, representing an addition of nearly 3d. in the pound. The policy of Parliament having been to create so many new Metropolitan charges, it is not strange that the rates should have considerably increased of late years. The demand for improved paving, lighting, &c., with the growth of national wealth, has also led to a considerable expenditure, and it would not have been surprising to find that strictly local expenditure had shown an upward tendency, but the reverse is actually the case, as the following figures will show:— Year 1861. Year 1889. £ s. d. £ s. d. Total amount of rates levied 64,071 17 6 140,285 8 1 paid to Central Authorities 26,455 11 7 102,933 2 10 leaving for local expenditure £37,616 5 11 £37,352 5 3 So that in spite of an enormously increased consumption of gas for street lighting, and the general adoption of wood and asphalte paving, the local expenditure of the Parish in 1889 was absolutely less than in 186l. 42 The Vestry are not sorry that the increase in the rates has attracted the attention of the parishioners, for it may lead the ratepayers to take a considerably increased interest in the election of the large spending bodies, such as the County Council and the School Board, with whom, rather than the Vestry, must rest the responsibility of so largely adding to the burdens of the ratepayers. COAL AND WINE DUES. When the time was approaching for the expiration of the duty levied on the coal and wine brought into the metropolis, the Vestry took occasion to explain at some length (Annual Report 1886-7, page 39) their reasons for apprehending that the non-renewal of the duty would not benefit the consumer, but would prejudicially affect the ratepayers. Unfortunately this anticipation has been more than realised. It is a matter of common knowledge that so far from the price of coal being less than in 1888, when a duty of 13d. per ton was imposed, it is now considerably higher, and although some increase has in the meantime taken place in the pay of the miners, such increase is out of all proportion to the enhanced price charged to the consumer. When, therefore, the Vestry of Hammersmith invited the co-operation of the Vestry in an appeal to the Corporation of the City of London to bring the matter before Parliament, at a fitting opportunity, with a view to the duty being reimposed for the purpose of providing funds for carrying out metropolitan improvements, the Vestry, without committing themselves to the details of any scheme for re-imposing the duty, approved generally of the proposal of the Hammersmith Vestry, and communicated with the Corporation to that effect. 43 The Vestry have appointed two of their members to attend a Conference proposed to be convened by the Kensington Vestry, to consider the desirability of taking joint action with a view to the dues being renewed. INHABITED HOUSE DUTY. The Vestry were much gratified by the announcement in the Budget Speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the more glaring of the anomalies in the incidence of the Inhabited House Duty, to which they had more than once directed attention, were to be removed. The hope thus hold out was realised in the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, which received the Royal assent on the 9th June. Under this Act, houses which are occupied by a person for the main purpose of letting furnished lodgings, are placed, as the Vestry have long contended they should be, on the same basis as private hotels; houses of an annual value not exceeding £40 are liable to duty at one-third only of the full amount, and houses of an annual value exceeding £40 but less than £60 are liable to duty at twothirds of the full amount; and houses built, or adapted to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health, for providing separate dwellings, at rents not exceeding 7a 6d. per week, are exempted from the duty altgether. On the 15th May the Vestry unanimously passed a resolution, thanking the Chanchellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Goschen) for the modifications made in the incidence of the duty, and expressing a hope that a reduced national expenditure will, at no distant date, admit of the total repeal of the duty. This resolution was conveyed to Mr. Goschen, and duly acknowledged. 44 For the information of such of the parishioners as are entitled to claim the lower rate of duty in respect of lodging houses, a notice of the action necessary to be taken in the matter was widely circulated by the Vestry. VESTRY PROPERTY. Vestry Hall.—The Vestry Hall and offices were cleaned as usual during the summer recess. Stables and Stoneyaed.—No works of importance have been required during the year. Disinfector.—The Disinfector has been used for disinfecting bedding, clothing, &c., for parishioners on 57 occasions, compared with 51 in 1889-90, and 42 in 1888-9. Mortuary.—The bodies of 24 persons have been received into the Mortuary during the year, as compared with 34 during the previous twelve months. Medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others who are specially brought into contact with the poor, are invited to assist the Vestry in preventing the spread of disease which may arise from the retention of a corpse in a room occupied perhaps by a number of people in a thicklypopulated neighbourhood, by making known, as occasion requires, the provision made for the reception of bodies in a decent manner, and with all possible deference to the natural feelings of the bereaved relatives. As the main object of providing a Mortuary and Disinfecting Apparatus is to protect the parishioners at large 45 against the spread of infectious disease, either may be used without charge. Information as to the mode of proceeding in such a case may be freely obtained at the Vestry Hall OTHER PARISH PROPERTY. Eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street were purchased in the year 1819, for parochial purposes. Two of the houses are now absorbed into the Workhouse premises, and the site of three others has been utilized for the erection of the Public Baths and Washhouses. The remaining six houses are let on repairing agreements. The rent received for these six houses, together with the sum receivable from the Westminster Union in respect of that portion of the AVorkhouse premises belonging to the Pariah of St. James, is applied in aid of the Poor Rate. SCAVENGING, DUST REMOVAL, &c. Under the system adopted by the Vestry, the roadsweepers are employed and paid by the Vestry, but the collection and removal of house dust, street refuse, &C., are done under contract The total cost of scavenging and dust removal for the past year, as given in the accounts, was £7,008 19s. 4½d., compared with £6,325 l6s. 6d. for the previous year. The wages of the street-sweepers have been increased by 2s. a week, making the standard rate of wages 21s per week for sweepers, and 23a for gangers. Overtime is paid for extra 46 The following is a statement of the number of loads reported to have been removed from the parish during the year :— Cart Loads. Wagon Loads. Dust 36 9,318 Slop 508 5,187 The cost of Street Watering last year was £884 13s. 4d., or £62 l1s. 0d. less than in 1889-90. WORKMEN'S SICK FUND. A sick fund, on the principle of a slate club, limited to the Vestry's workmen, has been in operation since the 1st August, 1887. The Vestry contribute the sum of 5s. a week to the funds of the club, in lieu of allowing sick pay to individual workmen. An exceptional amount of sickness prevailed early in the year 1890, and the ordinary resources of the club not being equal to the demands made upon them, the Vestry gave a special grant of £15 to the fund, on condition that not less than £10 is left undivided at the end of each year. REMOVAL OF SNOW. In anticipation of the approach of winter, the Vestry sought and obtained permission from the Thames Conservators and the London County Council, to cast clean snow over the parapet of the Victoria Embankment into the river The Vestry have had occasion to avail themselves of this permission more than once during the winter. The first heavy snowfall occurred on the 28th November. About 30 47 tons of salt were spread on the roadways for the purpose of opening up the streets more readily for traffic, a number of extra men were engaged in heaping, removing, carting, and casting snow into the river, and about 155 cubic yards were so removed. The total cost was £79 7s. 7d. On the 15th December a second fall of snow took place, but this was dissolved by the use of 22 tons of salt. Cost. £38 10s. 0d. A heavier fall occurred on the 19th December, and was followed by several small showers, which considerably impeded the work of removal, and the difficulty experienced in obtaining sufficient carts at the Christmas season led to further delay. On this occasion altogether 40 tons of salt were used; 6,067 cubic yards of snow were removed; the total cost of suit and extra manual and team labour being £440 9s. 7d. On the 8th January there was a further fall of snow, when 29 tons of salt were used, and 728 cubic yards of snow were carted to the river, the total cost being £112 6s. 8d. Snow fell again on the 9th and 10th March, and on this occasion 15 tons of salt were used, and 3,236 cubic yards of snow were carted to the river and elsewhere. The total cost was £239 15s. 6d. The successive falls of snow thus entailed a direct cost to to the ratepayers of £916 9s. 4d., irrespective of the indirect loss arising from the interruption to business. On a fall of snow, the efforts of the Vestry are necessarily concentrated in the first instance on rendering the arterial 48 thoroughfares fit for traffic, and every street receives attention in turn according to its relative importance in point of traffic. CONTRACTS FOR WORKS AND MATERIALS. Particulars of the various contracts entered into or continued during the year are given on page 147. STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1890, there were 818 public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, 782 of which were ordinary street lamps (459 burning cannel gas, and 323 burning common gas), 4 were urinal lamps, and 32 were larger lamps attached to refuges, and this number remained unaltered on the 25th March, 1891. The ordinary street lamps are lighted, extinguished, and cleansed by the Gas Company, at an inclusive sum of £2 17s. 0d. for cannel, and £2 17s 8d. for common gas per lamp per annum. The light given is practically identical, 4ft. of cannel gas being supplied per lamp per hour, and 5ft. of common gas. As regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total cost of street lighting for the past year amounted to £2,658 6s. 8d., as compared with £2,707 0s. 11d. for the previous twelve months. This sum is exclusive of new lamp-posts, lanterns and fittings, which cost a further sum of £373 15s. 1d. 49 The Vestry have terminated the contract with Messrs. S. Pontifex & Co. for the maintenance of street lanterns, &c, and have entered into an arrangement with Messrs. R. & J. Shiers for carrying out the work on slightly different conditions. As in the former case, the arrangement is terminable on the 25th December in any year, on one month's previous notice. The agreed rate of maintenance is as follows:— Per annum. 16in. lantern and column 5/6 14in. „ ,, 5/3 16in. „ and bracket 5/6 14in. „ ,, 5/9 “Metropole” lanterns, and bracket or coloumn 6/- Refuge lanterns and column 17/6 Metropolitan Board pattern lantern and column 8/6 Keeping in repair or supplying new governors and burners as required to refuge lamps 2/6 Ditto ditto other meter lamps 2/6 Ditto ditto meter fittings 5/- Cleaning services of all 7/6 INCREASED COST OF GAS. The increased charge by the Gas Light and Coke Company to private consumers does not affect the cost of public lighting, which is fixed by Parliament at the lowest rate in force, for the time being, for private lighting in the Metropolis. The South Metropolitan Gas Company have not seen the necessity of increasing their charge, consequently the cost of public lighting north of the Thames remains unaltered. D 50 PRIVATE LAMPS. The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of Private Lamps, except upon the follownig conditions:— 1. That no part of such Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside of the kerb bounding the footway. 3. That all such Lamps shall be entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such cases as Medical Men, Post Offices, Sweeps, Fire Engines, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency. 4. That no such Lamps shall be suspended by ball and socket joint only. 5. That no Lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed Lamps with their dimensions.. and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. It was stated in last year's Report that two companies had been authorised to supply electricity throughout the Parish, and that these companies had adopted different systems of supply. The system of the London Electric Supply Corporation is one of high pressure and double conversion, that is, the current leaves the generating station at a potential of about 51 10,000 volts; it is converted by transformers at the distributing stations to a current of 2,400 volts, and is further converted by a second transformer on, or before entering, the consumer's premises to a potential of about 100 volts. Being an alternating current, it is not yet available either for power or storage. The Board of Trade have notified to the Vestry the conditions under which they have provisionally sanctioned the adoption of this System of supply. The St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company have obtained a Provisional Order which supersedes the Licence under which they commenced work. Their system of Supply is a direct continuous current distributed throughout at a low pressure, the potential slightly exceeding 100 volts. This current can be utilised for power and can be accumulated in storage batteries or accumulators on the premises of consumers. It has thus two advantages over the competing system of the London Electric Supply Corporation. On the other hand, the mains of the St James's Company occupy a larger space in the streets than those of the London Company, and cannot carry the current so great a distance. The Board of Trade have also notified their approval of the system of supply adopted by the St James's and Pall Mall Company. With regard to the mains laid under certain streets by the London Electric Supply Corporation, in a manner not approved by the Vestry, to which reference was made in the Report for last year, the Corporation have given an indemnity to the Vestry against any loss or liability arising therefrom, and the Vestry have therefore resolved uot to insist upon the removal of the mains. Mains subsequently laid by the Corporation have been laid in accordance with the requirements of the Vestry. D 2 52 STREET NAMES. Orders have been made by the London County Council, and carried into effect by the Vestry, for re-naming streets and re-numbering premises, as follows— New Name. Names Abolished. No. of Houses and other Buildings Renumbered. Babmaes Mews None 14 Coach and Horses Yard None 19 Cork Street Mews None 9 Ham Yard None 20 Marlborough Mews Blenheim Mews 26 Ormond Yard None 18 Portland Mews None 11 Regent Place, No. 5 None 1 Shaftesbury Avenue Richmond Street 56 STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford Street which is situate in the Parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The cost of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion of the thoroughfare is ascertained annually and paid by the Vestry. By an order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the following thoroughfares are placed under the exclusive management of the Vestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover, 53 Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, instead of according to the actual Parish Boundary, viz.:— Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St James's Street, and Park Place. No payment is made by either Vestry to the other under this Order, the exchange of area being regarded as an equivalent. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21st December, 1883, placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Meard's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes of cleansing and maintenance, and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for the same purposes, of the Strand District Board. An arrangement made some years since with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street as regards the cleansing and paving, in consequence of the boundary line being somewhat irregular, is still in force. PAVING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. Most of the paving and drainage works during the past year consisted of maintenance and repair, and details of the work will be found in the Surveyor's Report, commencing on page 115. PULTENEY STREET IMPROVEMENT. When the widening of Little Pulteney Street was effected a few years since under an arrangement, between the Vestry and the Commissioners of Woods, Forests, and land Revenues, the improvement was left uncompleted at the eastern end of the street, in Consequences of the lease of the “Round House” then having still eight or nine years 54 to run, and the Vestry deeming it inexpedient to purchase the interest of the lessee for the intervening period. There was, however, a tacit understanding that before the lease was renewed the Vestry would be afforded an opportunity of completing the improvement on the basis of land in the possession of a freeholder, so as to avoid the necessity of paying compensation for subsidiary interests. In the month of April, the Vestry received a letter from the lessee's surveyor, stating that he had made an application to the Commissioners of Woods for a new building lease of the “Round House," and the premises adjacent thereto in Wardour Street, and that the Crown Surveyor had suggested the desirability of particulars being submitted to the Vestry as they might wish to avail themselves of the opportunity to continue the widening of Little Pultenev Street to Wardour Street. Negotiations followed, which it is hoped will result in satisfactory terms being arranged and the improvement being completed in the course of the current year. MAIN ROADS. For the reasons stated in their last Annual Report, the Vestry were not surprised to receive an intimation from the London County Council that they were not prepared to declare any further thoroughfares to be “main roads," under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888. It will be remembered that when a thoroughfare is declared a “main road” by the County Council, the Council bear either the whole or part of the cost of maintaining the same, according as the local authority elect to allow the control of the road to pass to the County Council or to retain it in their own hands. 55 REFUGES. No additional Refuges have Wen formed during the year, but, on the suggestion of the Commissioner of Police, the position of two Refuges at Piccadilly Circus has been altered with a view to facilitate the traffic at this point The following is a list of Refuges in the Parish:— Great Marlborough Street. Haymarket, South end. Pall Mall, by the United Service Club. ,, by the Athenæum Club. „ by St. James's Palace. „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly.by St. James's Street. „ by Burlington House. „ by Vestry Hall. „ by Piccadilly Circus. ,, by the Haymarket. Piccadilly Circus (2 Refuges). Regent Street, by Oxford Circus. „ „ by Argyll Place. „ „ by Conduit Street. „ „ by New Burlington Street. „ „ by Heddon Street. „ „ by Glasshouse Street. „ „ by Air Street. „ „ by the County Fire Office (2 Refuges). „ „ by Shaftesbury Avenue. „ „ by Jermyn Street. „ „ by Charles Street. St. James's Street, by No. 1. „ „ by King Street. Shaftesbury Avenue, by Wardour Street. „ ,, by Rupert street. „ „ by Great Windmill Street. „ „ by piccadilly Restaurant. „ „ by Piccadilly Circus (2 large and 2 small Refuges). Waterloo Place (two). 56 CONSTRUCTION OF VAULTS. The following regulations have been made in regard to the construction of vaults under footways:— 1. That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation of such plan as sanctioned be made during the execution of the work, without the consent of the Vestry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, ©r nine inches thick. 4. That the space from the upper surface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line o kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. SANITARY. It will be seen on reference to the report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 179, and the appendices thereto, that continuous attention has been paid to the abatement and removal of nuisances. It is impossible, however, to convey any accurate idea of the extent or value of sanitary work by the mere tabulation of figures. The most satisfactory proof of the value of this department of the Vestry's work is afforded by the reduction in the rate of mortality in the Parish since the creation of a sanitary department some thirty years since. Without here entering further into details, it may be remarked that the Medical Officer of Health reports that the death rate of the parish was 11.38 per 1,000 for the year 1890, as compared with a rate of 20'3 for the whole 57 Metropolis. The cases of fever were again unusually numerous during the year, but were chiefly infantile in character, and marked by a very low rate of mortality. Thus, 52 eases of scarlet fever, 7 of enteric or typhoid fever, 1 of continued fever, 11 of diphtheria, 5 of erysipelas, and 1 of membranous croup came under the knowledge of the sanitary officers, but only 7 deaths were attributable to these diseases. Two officers have been constantly engaged in the work of inspection with a view to detecting and removing nuisances, but the Vestry are still more anxious to prevent unsanitary conditions which give rise to nuisances. With this object they once more appeal to the parishioners for intelligent co-operation, especially to such as by their avocations are brought into contact with residents in the poorer and more crowded districts. The Vestry will be glad at all times to receive early information of any nuisance or supposed nuisance. It is not absolutely necessary that the name and address of the informant should be given in all cases, although it is very desirable that this should be done where possible, in order to save loss of time in fruitless inquiry. Another and most valuable mode of assisting and maintaining a high degree of public health is for each householder to insist upon scrupulous cleanliness being observed in the premises under his control. It cannot be too strongly urged that proper precautions against infection will also do much to insure immunity from sickness generally, The great preventive of disease is cleanliness— cleanliness in living, cleanliness of person, and 58 cleanliness of surroundings, The Vestry, as the local Sanitary Authority, are constantly striving after this condition of things, but unless the parishioners generally heartily co-operate in their several spheres, a great part of the work of the Vestry will be rendered nugatory, The Vestry are strongly impressed with the value of portable dust receptacles, of proper description, as a means of cleanliness, and urge their adoption universally in place of the old type of brick-built dustbins, which are frequently placed in most unsuitable positions, DISCONTINUING WATER SUPPLY TO DWELLING HOUSES. In the month of October a letter was received from the Poplar District Board of Works forwarding copy of a Memorial to the Local Government Board suggesting an amendment of the law to prevent Water Companies discontinuing a supply of water to dwelling houses under any circumstances whatever, on the ground that water is necessary for the prevention of nuisances likely to injure the public health. While approving of the object desired by the Poplar District Board, the Vestry did not quite agree that the Water Company should be deprived of what is, at present, in some instances the only effectual remedy for enforcing payment for water, unless some other adequate remedy is afforded them. The Vestry therefore suggested that in the case of defective fittings, not arising from the fault of the tenant, the Company should be authorised to carry out any necessary repairs, on default of the owner, and recover the cost in the manner provided by the Water Companies (Regulation of Powers) Act, 1887, and that if, in certain cases, 59 discontinuing a supply of water to dwelling houses still remained the only remedy, the Company should not exercise the |power except upon an order of a magistrate made after the hearing of evidence. No legislative action, however, has been taken in the matter. SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND COWSHEDS. There is now only one licensed slaughter house and no cow-house in the Parish. INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFICATION ACT, 1889. The operation of this Act has not been attended by any friction, and has resulted in many cases in the sanitary officers obtaining earlier information of the occurrence of infectious disease than would have otherwise been the case. The Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1800, the main features of which are noticed on page, 78 supplements this Act, and the two will probably prove very effectual in limiting the extent of any future epidemic. During the year ended at Lady-day, 78 parishioners were notified to the Medical Officer of Health as suffering from infections disease, viz.:— Small-Pox 1 Cholera 0 Diphtheria (including 1 diphtheric croup) 11 Membraneous Croup 3 Erysipeals 7 Scarlet Peter 47 Typhus Fever 0 Typhoid Fever 7 Relapsing Fever 0 Continued Fever 1 Puerperal 1 78 60 REMOVAL OF INFECTIOUS SICK TO HOSPITALS. The attention of the Vestry having been drawn to the difficulty which had arisen in a neighbouring parish in obtaining the removal of a person suffering with an infectious disease, the Vestry again communicated with the Local Government Board as to the desirability of all the Hospitals belonging to the Metropolitan Asylums Board being declared to be within a convenient distance of the districts of the various Sanitary Authorities in the metropolis, with a view to removing certain difficulties in the way of putting in operation the 26th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866. This section provides for the removal to hospital of any person who is suffering from “any dangerous contagious or infectious disease," and is without proper lodging or accommodation, provided that within the district of the authority seeking to make such removal there is a hospital in which such cases can be received. To meet the case of a large number of parishes in the metropolis, which are not provided with hospitals open to the reception of infectious cases two amending Acts of Parliament have been passed. The first (33 & 34 Vic., cap. 53, sec. 2) provides that for the purposes of the 26th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, every hospital or place for the reception of the sick situate within the limits of the Metropolis shall be deemed to be situate within the district of every Nuisance Authority in the Metropolis, and the second (37 & 38 Vic, cap. 89, sec. 51) enacts that every hospital or place for the reception of the sick, which shall be declared by an order of the Local Government Board to be within a convenient distance of the district of any such authority, shall be deemed to be within the district of the authority. 61 As the Metropolitan Asylums Board appear to have adopted the practice of treating all smallpox patients in buildings outside the metropolis, the earlier of the amending Acts does not apply, and the Vestry have therefore suggested to the Local Government Board the desirability of their making an order declaring that all the hospitals belonging to the Asylums Board (irrespective of situation) are within a convenient distance of the districts of the various Metropolitan nuisance authorities, or that some provision may be made for meeting any difficulty likely to arise under the existing law in the Bill which it is understood the President of the Local Government Board is about to introduce for amending the law relating to the public health. ST. JAMES'S DWELLINGS. This property continues to be well let, although necessarily there is a frequent change of tenants. The building having been continuously occupied for three years, the external iron and wood work was painted and other works carried out during the summer, at a cost .of £94 13s. 3d. The Vestry have had under consideration the desirability of erecting a laundry on the roof of the dwellings, but having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the contiguity of the public washhouses in Dufour's Place, have decided to take no action in the matter. During the year the Vestry have been able to invest a further sum of £400 towards replacing the capital on the expiration of the leases. A copy of the Accounts of the Trust Fund will be found on pages 150 and 151. 62 REGISTERED HOUSES. Seven houses have been registered during the year under the sanitary regulations of the Vestry made under the provisions of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874. At Lady-day, 1891, thirty-five houses were on the register. Breaches of the Regulations have occurred in someinstances, but have been remedied without the necessity of recourse to legal proceedings. INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, having transferred to the Local Sanitary Authorities the duty of inspecting retail bakehouses, the following abstract of the requirements of the law with regard to the cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding and sanitary condition of retail bakehouses is given for the information of parishioners:— 1. A bakehouse to be in conformity with the Acts relating to retail bakehouses, is subject to the following requirements:— (a) It must be kept in a cleanly state, and free from effuvia arising from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. (b) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on therein as to be injurious to the health of the persons employed, and shall be ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, all the gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the manufacturing process that may beinjurious to health. (c) The ceilings or tops of the bakehouse and all passages and staircases must either be painted with oil, or varnished, or limewashed, or partly painted or varnished and partly limewashed. If painted or varnished, the surface must be covered with three coats of paint or varnish, and renewed once at least in every seven years, and' 63 washed with hot water and soap at least once in every six months. Limewashing is to be renewed once at least in every six months. 2. No place on the same level with the bakehouse and forming part of the same building may be used as a sleeping place, unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at least four-and-a-half feet are made to open for ventilation. 3. A bakehouse must not be in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse. 4. No child, young person, or woman may be employed in a bakehouse contrary to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878. Penalties are provided in the event of an infringement of the law; bakehouses brought into use after the 31st of May, 1883, are subject to certain further requirements. The bakehouses in the parish (33 in number) are underfrequent inspection by the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry It has not been found necessary to take proceedings against the occupiers of any premises of that description during the past year. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. The following is a list of the articles purchased by the Inspector, and submitted to the Public Analyst, appointed by the Vestry during the year:— Arrowroot 5 Coffee 20 Milk 5 Pepper 6 Sulphur, Milk of 13 Vinegar 4 53 64 Proceedings for penalties were taken in three cases, and the vendors of samples submitted to analysis were cautioned in two other cases, where the extent of adulteration, as a first offence, did not appear to warrant prosecution. A penalty of 20s. was inflicted for the sale of vinegar, certified to contain 28 per cent. of added water. In two cases of milk of sulphur, certified to contain 103/4 and 35½ per cent. respectively, of gypsum, summonses were taken out, but not finally adjudicated upon. The case of the Vestry was that milk of sulphur, which admittedly can only be prepared by precipitation, is synonymous with precipitated sulphur of the British Pharmacopoeia, and should, consequently, consist of pure sulphur only, and this view was supported by references to recognised authorities. To rebut this view, the solicitor for the defence called attention to an appeal at the Knutsford Quarter Sessions in April, 1887 (Reg. v. Marshall), in which the Court held that the evidence then adduced satisfied them that milk of sulphur, precipitated by sulphuric acid and containing gypsum, was recognised in the trade as a distinct article from precipitated sulphur, precipitated by hydrochloric acid as directed by the British Pharmacopoeia and consisting of pure sulphur only. This appeal has not been reported in any of the recognized reports, but is fully given in the Chemist and Druggist, a trade journal of the period. The solicitor for the defence stated that he was prepared to bring forward similar evidence on the present occasion, and the magistrate said that although the point raised by the Vestry was no doubt a strong one, yet if he felt bound to convict after hearing all the evidence, his decision would not carry much weight, and he therefore thought the best course would be to adjourn the further 65 hearing sine die, so that, if such a course were found practicable, the summonses might be revived and a case stated for the High Court on a point of law. As it does not appear possible to raise any point of law in such a manner as to decide the main issue, the Vestryhave not proceeded further in the matter, but, as the precipitation of sulphur by sulphuric acid is an unscientific process, resulting in the precipitation of gypsum in proportions varying from less than 10 to more than 60 per cent., and therefore rendering milk of sulphur so prepared most uncertain in its action as a drug, the Vestry have called the attention of the Local Government Board to the question. It should be added that 13 samples of milk of sulphur purchased from various druggists in the parish were analysed, and of these 11 were absolutely pure, and 2 only contained gypsum. The majority of the druggists in St. James's evidently therefore hold the view of the . Vestry, that precipitated sulphur is sulphur and not sulphur plus an uncertain quantity of insoluble gypsum. The cost incurred by the Vestry for the year in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act is as follows:— £ s. d. Allowance to Analyst 75 0 0 Purchase of Samples, &c. 0 11 10 75 11 10 The administration of these Acts is not attended with the success which could be desired, principally for two E 66 reasons: the inadequacy of the fines inflicted, and the difficulty often experienced in reaching the really guilty party. Upon the first point, the Local Government Board in their Report for the year 1889-90, make the following remarks:— Proceedings were taken in 1691 of these cases, and fines were imposed amounting, in the aggregate to £2,309 exclusive (in most cases) of costs. The average penalty was thus £1 7s. 4d. In six instances the maximum fine of £20 was imposed; and there were 18 fines of £10 each, six over £5 and under £10 and 85 of £5. If we exclude these cases, amounting to less than seven per cent. of the whole, we find that the average penalty was less than £1, an amount which is quite insignificant in comparison with the profit of adulteration. It is more than probable that the leniency of the magistrate in the administration of these acts is largely due to a feeling that frequently the real offender is not before them. There can be little doubt that the plea often urged by small retail traders that the adulterated article is sold by them as received from the wholesale dealer, is, in a large number of cases, perfectly true. It is manifest that any remedy possessed by the retailer in a small way of business against the wholesale dealer is necessarily difficult of enforcement, on account of their relative financial positions, even supposing the retailer is not supplied on credit, and thus, in some cases, dependent almost for his existence on the forbearance of the wholesale house. The Vestry have had under consideration a suggestion by the Vestry of Kensington that in order to bring the wholesale dealer within the purview of the Acts, retail traders might, by notice or summons, join them in the proceedings 67 as co-defendants. It appeared, however, that the course suggested would prove wholly inoperative in the large majority of cases, for financial reasons which are alluded to above. But in the opinion of the Vestry the Acts might usefully be amended by requiring all goods sold in original packets to be distinctly labelled with the name and address of the wholesale dealer, and the name of the wholesale dealer to be disclosed by the retailer in the case of all sales where bulk is broken, and by authorising the prosecuting authority to proceed directly against the wholesale dealer, either alone or in conjunction with the retailer, and to call the retailer as a witness. A communication to this effect has been addressed to the Local Government Board. SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS. Summonses have been taken out in the following cases:— Adulteration 3 Non-payment of paving account 1 Nuisance 1 Unlawful occupation of underground rooms 2 Using hoard as advertising station contrary to licence 1 Total 8 Fines were inflicted in four cases. The paving account was paid before the day of hearing, the nuisance was removed without the intervention of the Court, and the E 2 68 remaining two cases, which related to the sale of milk of sulphur containing gypsum, were adjourned sine die, under the circumstances mentioned on page 64. The appeal against the conviction for erecting the shelter at the Lyric Theatre, referred to in last year's Report, was not proceeded with, and an agreement has since been entered into, by which the rights of the Vestry are recognised and protected. In addition to the above-mentioned summary cases, proceedings have been taken against persons concerned in the management of brothels, and charges have been preferred for assaulting the attendant at the Piccadilly Conveniences, for destroying a copy of the List of Parliamentary Voters, for posting bills in public urinals, and for extinguishing the light in a public lamp. A conviction was obtained in each case, and the Vestry desire to acknowledge the assistance rendered by the police in regard to these charges, most of which were indeed preferred by constables. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Several prosecutions for keeping disorderly houses have been undertaken during the year on the complaints of ratepayers, and a conviction was obtained in each case. One person, who had been convicted in respect of another house in the parish a few months previously, was, on the second conviction, sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour for three months. In some cases, where circumstances did not appear to render legal proceedings necessary or expedient, notice was given to the responsible parties, with the effect of causing a discontinuance of the annoyance. 69 Complaints against the owners or occupiers of certain houses were under consideration at the date of this report. DRINKING FOUNTAIN. There is but one Drinking Fountain in the Parish, that in the Churchyard wall in Piccadilly. This Fountain was erected and is maintained without cost to the Vestry. CONVENIENCES, PICCADILLY CIRCUS. During the twelve months ending at Lady-day, the men's closets have been used by 215,467 persons, the ladies' conveniences by 164,275, the men's lavatory (which was only opened on the 26th September) by 3,076, and the ladies' lavatory by 2,413. No record is kept of the use of the urinals, for which no charge is made, but it is estimated that not less than 2,600,000 persons have made use of them during the year. The enormous use of the urinals and other conveniences has necessarily led to some slight repairs being required, such as the re-facing of the entrance steps, and a few minor details. To meet an evident want, lavatories have been fitted in the men's side of the conveniences. The period for which the Public Gardens Association undertook to maintain shrubs at the entrance to the ladies' conveniences expired in May, and the shrubs being a manifest improvement the Vestry have entered into an arrangement for their being continued for a further period of one year, the agreed sum for the same being £15. 70 Careful consideration was given to the system to be adopted for checking the use of the closets, and eventually the offer by Mr. J. N. Maskelyne, of the Egyptian Hall to fix and maintain his registering locks for the sum of 10s. each per annum, was accepted. Owing to the increased use of the urinals, an additional boy has been engaged to assist the attendants. The regular staff now consists of two male and two female attendants and two boys, taking alternate duty for a turn of nine hours. A statement of the receipts and working expenses of the conveniences will be found in the Accounts commencing on page 132. URINALS.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE (PREVENTION) ACT, 1890. This Act marks an important advance in Sanitary legislation, and as some of its provisions are novel in character, the following extracts from a circular letter issued by the Local Government Board, summarising the Act are given for the information of the parishioners:— The Act confers upon local authorities and their officers important powers and duties as regards— (a) The inspection of dairies and the prohibition of the supply of milk therefrom iu cases where it appears that infectious disease is attributable to, or likely to be caused by, the consumption of milk so supplied; (b) The cleansing and disinfection of premises, bedding, clothing, &c., for the purpose of preventing or checking infectious disease; (c) The retention, removal, and burial of the bodies of persons who have died from infectious disease ; 79 (d) The detention in hospital of persons suffering from infectious disease who would, on leaving the hospital, be without proper lodging; and (e) The provision of temporary shelter and attendance for members of families who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of the dwellings being disinfected by the local authority The infectious diseases to which the Act primaiily applies are those mentioned in section 6 of the Infectious disease (Notification) Act, 1889. Inspection of Dairies and Prohibition of Supply of Milk.— Section 4 of the Act provides that in case the medical officer of health is in possession of evidence that any person in the district is suffering from infectious disease attributable to milk supplied within the district from any dairy situate within or without the district, or that the consumption of milk from the dairy is likely to cause infectious disease to any person residing in the district, the medical officer shall, if authorised in that behalf by an order of a justice having jurisdiction in the place where the dairy is situate, have power to inspect such dairy, and, if accompanied by a veterinary inspector or some other properly qualified veterinary surgeon, to inspect the animals in the dairy. If, on such inspection, the medical officer of health is of opinion that infectious disease is caused from consumption of the milk supplied from the dairy, be is to make a report to the local authority whose officer he is. This report must be accompanied by any report that may be furnished to him by the veterinary inspector or veterinary surgeon above mentioned. The local authority may thereupon give notice to the dairyman to appear before them within such time, not less than 24 hours, as may be specified in the notice, to show cause why an order should not be made requiring him not to supply any milk from the dairy within the district until the order has been withdrawn by the local authority. If, in the opinion of the local authority, he fails to show such cause, they may make the order. Notice of the facts must forthwith be given by the local authority to the sanitary authority and county counoil of the district or county in which the dairy is situate, and also to the Local Government Board. The order may, however, be forthwith withdrawn on the local authority, or the medical officer of health on their behalf, being satisfied that the milk supply has been changed, or that the cause of the infection has been removed 80 Cleansing and Disinfection of Premises and Articles; Public Conveyance of Infected Corpses; Deposit of Infectious Rubbish.— By section 5 of the Act, section 22 of the Sanitary Act, 1866, so far as it relates to any London district, is repealed Section 5 of the present Act substitutes for the repealed enactment the following provisions:— Where the medical officer of health of any local authority, or any other registered medical practitioner, certifies that the cleansing and disinfecting of any house, or part of it, and of any articles in it likely to retain infection, would tend to prevent or check infectious disease, the clerk is to give notice in writing to the owner or occupier that the house or part, and any articles in it likely to retain infection, will be cleansed and disinfected by the local authority at the cost of the owner or occupier, unless he informs the local authority, within 24 hours from the receipt of the notice, that he will do the cleansing and disinfection, to the satisfaction of the medical officer of health, within a time fixed in the notice. (Sub-section (1).) If, within 24 hours from the receipt of the notice, the person to whom it is given does not inform the local authority that he will so do the cleansing and disinfection, or if, having so informed the local authority, he fails to have the work done within the time fixed in the notice, the house or part of a house and articles are to be cleansed and disinfected by the officers of the local authority under the superintendence of the medical officer of health. The expenses incurred may be recovered from the owner or occupier in a summary manner. (Subsection (2.)) But the section is subject to the proviso that, where the owner or occupier of the house or part of a house is unable, in the opinion of the local authority, or of their medical officer of health, effectually to cleanse and disinfect it, and any article therein likely to retain infection, the offioers of the local authority, with the consent of the owner or occupier, may undertake the cleansing and disinfection at the cost of the local authority, without any notice being given to the owner or occupier under sub-section (1) If the members of a family in which infectious disease has appeared are compelled to leave their dwelling for the purpose of enabling such dwelling to be disinfected by the local authority, the local authority are to provide them, free of charge, with temporary shelter or house accommodation and any necessary attendants. (Section 15.) 81 Section 6 of the Act relates to the disinfection of bedding, clothing, or other articles likely to retain infection. It provides that any local authority, or the medical officer of health of any local authority, who has received from them a general power for that purpose may, by notice in writing, require the owner of any bedding, clothing, or other articles which have been exposed to the infection of an infectious disease, to cause the same to be delivered over to an officer of the local authority for removal for the purpose of disinfection. The bedding, clothing, and articles are to be disinfected by the authority, and to be brought back and delivered to the owner free of charge, and if any of them suffer any unnecessary damage the authority are to compensate the owner for the same. The amount of compensation will be recoverable in. and in case of dispute is to be settled by, a court of summary jurisdiction. Any person who fails to comply with the requirement of the local authority or medical officer of health is to be liable to a penalty not exceeding £10. For the protection of persons entering into occupation of a house or part thereof in which infectious disease may have occurred, it is enacted in section 7 that where a house, room, or part of a house lias been occupied by a person suffering from any infectious disease, and the premises are vacated by the tenant within six weeks after they have been so occupied, without the premises and all articles therein liable to retain infection having been disinfected to the satisfaction of a registered medical practitioner, as testified by a certificate signed by him, or without the owner of the premises having had notice from the person vacating the premises of the previous existence of such disease, such person is made liable to a penalty not exceeding £10. A similar penalty is imposed in the case of a person ceasing to occupy any house, room, or part of a house, who, on being questioned by the owner thereof, or by any person negotiating for the hire of such house, room, or part of a house, as to the fact of there having, within six weeks previously, been therein any person suffering from an infectious disease, kno vingly makes a false answer to the question. Notice of the provisions of section 7 are to be given by the local authority to the occupier of any house in which they are aware that there is a person suffering from an infectious disease. (Section 14.) F 82 A person will be guilty of an offence under the Act who hires or uses a public conveyance, other than a hearse, for the conveyance of the body of a person who has died from an infectious disease, without previously notifying to the owner or driver of the conveyance that the person whose body is or is intended to be so conveyed has died from infectious disease; moreover, if, after such notification, the owner or driver of the conveyance does not immediately after the conveyance has been used for conveying the body of a person who has died from infectious disease provide for the disinfection of the conveyance, he will bo guilty of an offence under the Act. (Section 11.) Any person who knowingly casts, or causes or permits to be cast, into any ash pit, ash-tub, or other receptacle for the deposit of refuse matter any infectious rubbish without previous disinfection, will also be guilty of an offence under the Act. (Section 13.) The local authority are to give notice of this provision to the occupier of any house in which they are aware that there is a person suffering from an infectious disease. (Section 14.) Retention, Removal, and Burial of Dead Bodies.—Without the sanction in writing of the medical officer of health, or of a registered medical practitioner, no person may, after the Act comes into operation, retain unburied, elsewhere than in a public mortuary, or in a room not used at the time as a dwelling-place, sleeping-place, or workroom, for more than 48 hours, th6 body of any person who has died of an infectious disease. (Section 8.) If a person dies from any infectious disease in a hospital, or place of temporary accommodation for the sick, and the medical officer of health, or any other registered medical practitioner, certifies that, in his opinion, it is desirable, in order to prevent the risk of communicating any infectious disease, or of spreading infection, that the body shall not be removed from such hospital or place except for the purpose of being immediately buried, the Act makes it unlawful for the body to be removed from such hospital or place except for" immediate burial. When the body is taken out of the hospital for that purpose, it is to be forthwith carried or taken direct to some cemetery or place of burial, and is to be forthwith there buried. (Section 9.) Any person wilfully offending against this section is made liable to a penalty not exceeding £10 Detention of Persons in Hospital.—Any justice of the peace acting in and for the district of the local authority, upon proper cause 83 shown to him, may make an order directing the detention in hospital, at the cost of the local authority, of any person suffering from an infectious disease, who is then in an hospital for infectious disease, and would not. on leaving the hospital, be provided with lodging or accommodation in which proper precautions could be taken to prevent his spreading the disorder. The order may be limited to some specific time, but any justice has power to enlarge the time as often as may appear to him to be necessary. On such an order being made, any officer of the local authority or inspector of police acting in the district, or any officer of tbe hospital, is empowered to take all necessary measures and do all necessary acts for enforcing the execution of the order. (Section 12.) . . . Such are the main features of the Act, for the enforcement of which Justices are authorised to make orders in certain cases, and for the breach of which the infliction of penalties is provided. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. This Acts consolidates and amends the various Acts relating to Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings, including those known as Torrens' Acts, Cross's Acts, and Lord Shaftesbury's Acts. Unhealthy areas are to be dealt with by the County Council, and the provisions of the Act in regard thereto need not therefore be noticed here. Unhealthy dwellings, obstructive buildings, and groups of buildings, insanitary in themselves or their surroundings, and too small to be classed as an unhealthy area, come within the jurisdiction of the Vestry, who are required to act upon a report by the Medical Officer of Health, of any F 2 84 dwelling-house which appears to him to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, or of any building not itself unfit for human habitation, but by reason of proximity to or contact with other buildings renders the latter unhealthy. If the local authority fail to perform their duties in relation to the closing or demolition of any such dwelling-house, the County Council may themselves take the necessary proceedings and recover the expenses incurred by them from the local authority. Some important modifications are made in the law with respect to the compensation to be paid for the sites and materials of condemned dwellings, and legal proceedings are in some respects expedited. The Vestry regard the codification of the law relating to the Houses of the Working Classes with considerable satisfaction, and look forward to a like codification of general sanitary legislation at an early date. As both the County Council and the local authorities have certain functions under the Act, some of them being concurrent, the Council invited the various local authorities to appoint two members each to confer with a Committee of the Council on certain provisions of the Act and to consider the methods of procedure to be followed. The first meeting of this conference was held on the 5th December, and an adjourned meeting on the 23rd January. No operative resolution was arrived at, but the interchange of views cannot fail to be of advantage to those taking part in the proceedings. LONDON WATER SUPPLY. Perhaps the most important question that has engaged the attention of the Vestry during the year is that of the 85 London Water Supply. For some time there has been a growing dissatisfaction, in many quarters, with the manner in which the charge for water increases, while the quantity needed and supplied is, perhaps, lessened, owing to a change in the purposes for which the building is used. In many parts of this parish, for instance, houses formerly occupied as dwellings are now used, wholly or partly, as business premises, with the result that water was supplied for all the needs of one family, or more, at one-third the amount now charged for two or three lavatories and other conveniences, in consequence of the premises being worth more as offices than as dwellings, and the water rental being based upon the annual value of the premises supplied irrespective of quantity. As the value of land in central London increases for business purposes, this state of things will become intensified. If the supply of water were in the hands of a public body, the additional income derived from the increased value of property would be applicable to reducing public burdens, but so long as it is in the hands of commercial companies this income is simply extra revenue to be distributed among the shareholders. It is evident that the longer the supply of water continues on its present basis, the greater will probably be the market value of the Water Companies Stocks and Shares, and the more carefully the subject is considered, the more apparent does it become that the interests of the public will be best served by the placing of the supply of water in the hands of a public body without any further delay. It is a matter of common knowledge that in the year 1880, Sir R. Cross, the Home Secretary, on the advice of an eminent valuer, entered into provisional agreements for the purchase of the undertakings of the eight companies now 86 supplying the metropolitan area with water, and. that these provisional agreements failed to receive the approval of Parliament in consequence of the high terms proposed for the transfer. It has often been asserted that Sir R. Cross's terms must be considerably increased when the undertakings of the Companies are transferred to a public authority. But a careful comparison of the figures would seem to show that this is not the case. The terms of settlement proposed by Sir R. Cross in 1880 are thus summarised by the Select Committee of the House of Commons, to whom the provisional agreements were referred:— The amount of immediate annuities to be paid under the agreements is £773,454; to this would have to be added deferred annuities to accrue by way of increments at various intervals, amounting finally to £325,499, making an ultimate annual payment of £1,098,953. The value of tbe immediate annuities in 3.} per cent, stock, taken at par, would be £22,098,700, and Mr. Smith estimated the present value of the deferred annuities at £6,851,300, making the total value of stock under the Agreements £28,950,000. If the deferred annuities had been capitalized at 3½ per cent., the total amount would stand at £29,734,281. In addition to this, it would have been necessary to make provision for the debt charges, viz., Preference and Debenture Capital amounting to £3,001,500, bearing an actual annual charge for interest of £133,913 and also for the Bond and Mortgage Debt, £223,055, with an annual charge for interest of £7,807. These interest charges Mr. E. J. Smith lated would, as well as the annuities, be covered by the income of the Companies when transferred under tbe agreements. Adding these charges to the total of the annuities granted as above, the annual payments would have been finally £1,240,073, and the total capital value would have stood at £33,018,836. £ Value of Annuities - - 29,734,281 Preferential and Debenture Capital 3,061,500 Mortgage and Bond Debt 223,055 £33,018,836 But in addition to this payment of a capital value estimated at £33,018,836, the New River Company were 87 to retain their landed estates with reversions of unascertained but very considerable value. The total capital outlay of the Companies in 1880 was nearly 12½ millions, and in; this outlay was included the acquisition of the landed estates by the New River Company. The value of the Water Companies' stock in the open market immediately before it was inflated by the negotiations undertaken by direction of Sir R. Cross was approximately 26 millions, so that Sir R. Cross practically offered a bonus of seven millions sterling and the landed estates of the New River Company, probably worth three or four millions more. It is apparent then that the terms proposed by Sir R. Cross were not such as could generally be accepted by prudent purchasers. It has also often been asserted that extravagant as were the terms proposed in 1880, the public would still have been the gainers. Mr. Samuel Wood, the accountant, a leading authority on the Water Companies' Accounts, however, gave evidence at the recent inquiry at the Guildhall, showing that this is not the case. He states that the deficiency during the nine years would have amounted to £365,307, made up as follows:— £ £ In the year 1880-1 deficiency 9.220 1881-2 gain 3,771 1882-3 ,, 13,98(5 1883-4 „ 24,058 „ 1884-5 deficiency 18,070 1885-6 „ 69,647 1886-7 „ 75,684 1887-8 „ 108,615 1888 9 ,, 125,886 407,122 41,815 Nett deficiency £365,307 88 This deficiency, however, might have been reduced by economies resulting from the unification of management, which would have resulted from the passing of Sir Richard Cross's Bill. Ten years having elapsed since Sir R. Cross's attempt to . settle the question, and successive governments having manifested no intention of re-opening the matter, the Vestry petitioned the House of Commons in the month of April to take the whole subject of the Metropolitan Water Supply into consideration, with a view either to restricting the powers of the Companies or transferring their undertakings to a representative municipal body such as the London County Council. Following up this action, the Vestry referred the question to their Sanitary and Parliamentary Bills Committee for consideration and report. The Committee presented two reports in which they discussed at some length (1) the acquisition of the existing water undertakings, (2) the amendment of the law so as to enable consumers to require a supply of water from the Companies by meter, and (3) an independent supply to be provided by the London County Council. After pointing out objections to the adoption of either of the last two alternatives, the Committee summed up the conclusions at which they had arrived, as follows:— To sum up the whole question, your Committee are of opinion:— 1. That the time has arrived when the supply of water to London should be placed in the hands of a public representative body, such as the London County Council. 2. That the best means of affecting this object is for the existing Water Undertakings to be transferred to auch public representative body. 89 3. That anything approaching the terms proposed by Mr. E. J. Smith in 1880 is "not a satisfactory or admissible basis of purchase." * 4. That, upon present information, the most equitable mode of assessing the value of the undertakings appears to be a calculation upon the profits either of the last completed year, after allowing for any extraordinary receipts or expenditure during such year, or the average of the last three years. 5. That the purchase-money should be paid in the form of. stock in preference to cash. 6. That taking the Birmingham Waterworks as a guide, the purchase of the Water Undertakings ought to be accomplished at a price less than, or not greatly exceeding £28,000,000. 7. That the London County Council should be authorised by Parliament to negotiate with the several Water Companies for the purchase of their Undertakings, with power to establish an independent, or competing or additional supply either in the whole or any portion of a district now supplied by a Water Company. With regard to the seventh of these resolutions, theVestry have seen occasion in the light of further information to somewhat modify their views. This Report was adopted, and circulated among the various Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, with a request that they would appoint representatives to attend a Conference to discuss what action it might be expedient to take with a view to placing the Water Supply of London on a more satisfactory basis. Thirty-two of the thirty-nine *Report of Select Committee, Sess. 2, 1880, par. 6. 90 authorities thus addressed responded to the invitation, and the first meeting of the Conference was held in St. James's Vestry Hall on the 19th June, under the presidency of Mr. Bonthron, customary chairman of the Vestry, when the following resolutions were passed:— 1. That this meeting of delegates from the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis affirms the necessity of the Water Supply of London being placed in the hands of a municipal body representative of London. 2. That in the opinion of this Conference, it is imperatively necessary to restrain the Water Companies from increasing their charges upon the basis of the Quinquennial Valuation now in progress ; and that this Conference therefore request the President of the Local Government Board to receive them as a deputation to (a) request him to re-consider the decision communicated to the House of Commons in reply to questions on 13th March, and 19th May ; (b) to submit the necessity for the introduction of a Bill by Her Majesty's Government to suspend the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Companies by the Act of 1847 and subsequent Acts as to the basis of their charges; and (c) failing the introduction of a Bill by the Government, to suggest that facilities may be afforded for the consideration of the Bill introduced by Mr. Causton, and now awaiting second reading. 3. That in view of the fact that the effect of the quinquennial revaluation of the Metropolis now in progress will be to augment the charge to consumers for the same supply of water as is enjoyed by them at the present time and thereby to increase by a very large sum the value nf the property of the Water Companies, the Government be requested forthwith to introduce a Bill to enable the London County Council or some other properly representative body to acquire the undertakings of the eight Water Companies now supplying London, or same of them, by agreement, or failing agreement to create a Board of Arbitrators to settle the terms of transfer by compulsory powers, or to give power to establish an independent supply. 4. That the President of the Local Government Board be requested to receive a deputation from the Local Authorities of London in 91 support of the above resolutions, and that all Members of Parliament representing metropolitan constituencies be invited to join the deputation. 5. That Mr. O. V. Morgan, M.P., and Mr. T. H. Bolton, M.P., be requested to introduce such deputation. 6. That Mr. James Beal be requested to state the views of the deputation at the proposed interview with the President of the Local Government Board 7. That the deputation to the President of the Local Government Board consist of all the delegates appointed to attend this conference. 8. That the Vestry Clerk of St. James, Westminster, be requested to bring the foregoing resolutions officially before the Committee of Enquiry on the London Water Supply now sitting at the Guildhall of the City of London. The presi dent of the Local Government Board (Mr. Ritchie) received the deputation on the 11th July. The deputation were introduced by Mr. O. V. Morgan, M.P., and Mr. T. H. Bolton, M.P. Several other members of Parliament representing metropolitan constituencies were present, including Mr. Baumann and Professor Stuart. At the request of the Conference, the views of the deputation were expressed by Mr. James Beal. In addition to submitting to Mr. Ritchie the resolutions passed at the Conference and arguments in support thereof, Mr Beal suggested that the most satisfactory and easy manner of dealing with the question would be for the Government to appoint, under statutory authority, a Commission of such a character as would command general confidence to consider and if possible settle the terms upon which the undertakings of the eight water companies supplying the Metropolis with water should be transferred to a public 92 authority. This Commission should represent the various interests concerned, for example, capitalists might be represented by the Governor of the Bank of England, the Companies by the Governor of the New River Company and perhaps another Company, the Ratepayers by the Chairman of the London County Council, and the City by representatives of the Corporation, and other interests in the same way. By the adoption of such a course Mr. Beal submitted that the settlement of the question would be removed from the domain of party politics, and might be proceeded with during the recess with a view to legistion early next session, before any claim could equitably be made by the water Companies for compensation in respect of the anticipated increase of assessment, arising solely from the quinquennial re-valuation now in progress. Mr. Ritchie, in reply to the Deputation, stated that the request to support legislation to set aside the Water Rate Definition Act, 1885, was one that the could not entertain on account of the principle involved in superseding rights conferred by statute. He rather looked to the difficulties being settled by placing the management of the Water Supply in the hands of a public authority. His personal view was that this authority should be the London County Council, in spite of the enormous amount of work they already had to get through. But the Corporation of the City were engaged on an inquiry, at their own expense, at the present time, into the whole subject of the London Water Supply, and the Bill of the London County Council then before Parliament proposed to authorise the Council to devote a certain sum of money to the same purpose. He therefore thought that, in view of these two inquiries, one in progress and the other in prospect, it would not be 93 desirable for him to take independent action. He presumed that these authorities would fully consider the question in the light of the information adduced at these inquiries, and would place their views before the Government. For his own part, he could promise that the Government would give full, careful, and he hoped satisfactory attention to the suggestions and reports which those bodies might make. On the 31st July, an adjourned meeting of the Conference was held to consider whether any further action should be taken in view of the reply of Mr. Ritchie to the deputation, and the following resolutions were passed:— 1. That as the London County Council has no power to duce a Bill into Parliament for the purchase of the Water Companies' undertakings, the Vestries and Distriot Boards represented at this Conference be advised (following the precedent successfully set in the case of Metropolis Gas Legislation) to unite in giving notice of and preparing a Bill for such a purchase, and for power to set up a competing supply. 2. That each Vestry and District Board be asked to contribute the sum of £10 under the 92nd section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, towards preliminary expenses, such as service of notices, advertising, drafting, and depositing a Bill for the purposes named in the foregoing Eesolution. That a Committee, consisting of one representative from each Vestry and District Board taking part in this Conference, be appointed to prepare such Notices, and draft Bill, and to take such other steps as may be necessary for promoting the Bill. 4. That the opinion of Counsel be taken as to the legality of Vestries contributing towards the preliminary expenses of promoting a private Bill dealing with the Water Question. 94 In accordance with the foregoing resolutions, the Vestry contributed £10 (subsequently increased to £100) towards, the expenses of promoting legislation, and appointed Mr. James Beal to serve on the Executive Committee. The Vestry since learned that the Executive Committee have employed Messrs. Jordan & Son, parliamentary agents, and retained Mr. J. W. Grover, C.E., to advise them on engineering questions. Notice of an intended application to Parliament for a Bill in the present session was given in the "London Gazette" and other newspapers in the month of November, in accordance with the StandingOrders of Parliament, and the Bill was introduced by Sir A. Borthwick, and read a first time on the 30th January, and a second time on the 4th March. The provisions of the Bill are thus summarised in a memorandum issued by the Executive Committee The Bill prepared by the Committee consists of 55 clauses and seven schedules. It is divided into six parts, viz.:- 1. Establishment of Water Trust, and acquisition of undertakings of Companies. 2. Financial. 3. Constitution and status of Water Trust. 4. Officers and Servants. 5. Miscellaneous. 6. Power to London County Council to carry Act into execution. But the provisions of the Bill perhaps can be best explained under a slightly different arrangement. Const Hution of Water Authority.—This is a question of more difficulty than may, at first sight, appear. The area supplied by the eight London Companies extends not only over the whole County of London, but into the Counties of Kent, Surrey, Middlesex, Herts, and 95 Essex. If London only were concerned, it might be urged that the London County Council should be the authority to take over the supply of water. Again, if the system of distribution were such as to allow the County Council to supply water in bulk to the Local Authorities of the surrounding districts at a price to be agreed upon from time to time, as is the case in many of the provincial corporate towns, the Council might be regarded as the natural Water Authority for the whole area, in consequence of the portion under its jurisdiction being more populous and more wealthy than the whole of the remainder. But the system of distribution is apparently too much interlaced among the various districts between the source of supply and the central area, to render any such course practicable. The only alternative seems to be a power of equal rating throughout the area of supply. And it is doubtful whether Parliament will confer upon one authority, such as tbe London County Council, power to levy rates for any purpose whatever within the jurisdiction of another constituted Authority. This power to levy rates may become a matter of importance forty or fifty years hence, by which time, if not earlier, considerable expenditure will probably be necessary to further supplement present sources of supply, if not to open up a new source, or sources, altogether. This expenditure should, in equity, be spread over the whole area of supply, but the ratepayers in the outer ring may fairly object to be assessed for an expenditure by a body upon which they are not represented. Circumstances may, indeed, necessitate the raising of a rate at a very early period, if any unforeseen circumstance arises to render the public water supply not self-supporting. The question of rating and representation is therefore one of some importance, especially bearing in mind that the area under the jurisdiction of the London County Council is approximately 120 square miles, while the area supplied by the eight Water Companies is approximately 460 miles, although at present London far exceeds in point of population and rateable value the remainder of the area. Alternative Proposals for a Water Authority.—Bearing in mind' the desirability, on the one hand, of avoiding the creation of a new Publio Authority in London, and on the other, the justice of the plea urged by consumers in the outer ring for representation on the Water Authority, the Committee have deemed it best to frame the Bill in such a way that, after hearing such evidence as may be tendered, Parliament may either create a special Authority or entrust the duty of water 96 supply to the London County Council. For this purpose it is proposed by the Bill (clause 30) to create a Trust of 39 members, but to reserve to the London County Council (clause 54) power by resolution to undertake the duties imposed by the Bill on the Trust, andthus render the creation of the Trust unnecessary. It is not anticipated that the Bill will pass in this form, but the question is thus deliberately raised in an alternative form, so that Parliament, in its wisdom, may select either a Special Trust, or the London County Council as the Authority to carry the Act into execution. Constitution of the Trust.—The Trust, as proposed by the Bill (clause 31), will be directly elected by the County Electors within the Metropolitan Water Area, i.e., by the persons entitled to vote in the election of members of the County Councils. The number of members of the Water Trust will be one-half the number of members elected in the same area to represent the constituencies in the House of Commons. There appear to be 77 Parliamentary Boroughs and other Electoral Divisions within the area, returning 78 members to Parliament, the City of London electing two members, and the other Boroughs and Divisions one each. The Water Trust will therefore consist of 39 members, one elected by the City of London, and one by each combination of two parliamentary boroughs or divisions, the combination to be arranged by the Local Government Board. The election is to be held subject to the rules regulating the election of members of the County Council, subject to such modifications (if any) as may be necessary to give effect to the Act, such modifications to be made by the Local Government Board. The first election is to be held on some day in February, 1892, to be appointed by the Local Government Board, and subsequent elections are to be held on the same day as the election of County Councils, i.e., November 1st. The chairman and two vice-chairmen will be salaried, but it is not proposed to pay the other members of the Trust. Provision is made for filling up casual vacancies, and rules are laid down in the 7th schedule regulating meetings of the Trust. Members will be disqualified from serving if they hold any office or place of profit under he Trust (other than that of chairman or vice-chairman), or participate in the profits of any work done by order of the Trust, or are concerned in or participate in the profits of any contract entered into by the Trust (clause 33). 97 Duties of the Trust.—The purposes of the Act are defined (clause 4) as being to vest in the Water Trust the sole and exclusive power of supplying water within the metropolitan water area for domestic, manufacturing, and general purposes; for maintaining in the mains a supply of water under pressure for high service and the extinguishment of fires; and for equalising the charges for water supply throughout the metropolitan water area. The Act is to be carried into effect by the acqaisition of the undertakings of the eight Metropolitan Companies and of the undertakings of the Rickmansworth Waterworks Company, and the Leatherhead and District Waterworks Company (clause 8 and schedule I.). The undertakings may be acquired by agreement or arbitration (clauses 8 and 12), and the provisions of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Acts are incorporated with the Bill, subject to modifications (clause 13). Until the transfer of the undertakings to the Water Trust, the Companies are to exercise their powers as Trustees for the Trust, and subject to a continuous audit (clause 9), so that the Act will take immediate effect for the benefit of the water consumers. Certain powers are conferred upon the Trust, including (clause 11) power to promote Bills in Parliament far any purposes connected with the water supply, or the extension or improvement of the same. Board, of Arbitration.—It is exceedingly unlikely that the Trust and all the Companies will agree to terms of transfer without arbitration, although it is highly probable that arbitration in the case of the :first of the Companies dealt with will result in the laying down of principles, rendering agreement with the other Companies a comparatively easy matter. Each undertaking will, failing agreement, necessarily be the subject of a separate arbitration. It is important that the same lines should be followed in each. Instead of arbitrators being appointed for each arbitration, it is therefore proposed by the Bill (clause 13) to constitute a Board of Arbitration to settle all claims for compensation. This Board will consist of four members, one appointed by the President of the Local Government Board, one by the Chairman of the Institute of Bankers, one by the Chairman of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and one by the Surveyors' Institution. Failing appointment by any of these, the Home Secretary is to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators. The nominee of the President of the Local Government Board is to be Chairman of the Board of Arbitration, with a casting vote in case of an equality of votes. Provision is made for the filling up of vacancies on this Board. In estimating the amount of G 98 compensation payable in respect of any undertaking, the Board of Arbitration are to have regard to the value of the undertaking prior to the introduction of the Bill into Parliament, and are not to take into consideration any claim for back dividends. Purchase Stock.—The compensation agreed to be paid or awarded by the Board of Arbitration is to be paid in purchase stock (clause 14 et scq.), power being reserved to individual shareholders to claim payment in cash (clause 15). A sinking fund must be commenced not later than 12 years from the passing of the Act, and the debt is to be extinguished within 80 years from the date of the creation of this fund (clause 24). The sinking fund may be used to redeem the Stock in the open market. Arrangements may be made with the Bank of England1 for the management of the Stock (clause 20), and Trustees are empowered to hold it as a recognised investment (clause 25). The Stock may bear a varying rate of interest (clause 14), and the importance of this proviso will be readily seen. For instance, whether the undertakings continue under private management or are transferred to a public authority, further capital will be required as new mains are laid to meet increased demands. Possibly in the course of the next generation a large sum will have to be raised to open up new sources of supply, and the value of the undertakings as now existing will then be little more than the value of the mains and pipes for the purposes of distribution. It may be assumed, therefore, that the value of the water undertakings, on their present basis, will diminish as time goes on, and, for that reason, it is not unfair that the present shareholders should receive the full advantage of their holdings in the Companies while the interest at definite periods is automatically reduced, in the same way as the interest on Government securities will diminish under the Act for the conversion of the National Debt. As an illustration, but as an illustration only, of one manner in which this provision will work, the following figures are given:— Amount of Purchase Stock, say £33,500,000 Initial rate of interest, say 3£ per cent. Annual charge £1,172,500 In 20 years, say, further capital is required and comes into charge. In 20 years, the rate of interest is reduced to 3 per cent., and the annual charge on the original Purchase Stock is £1,005,000 99 In 40 years, say, a new source of supply must be adopted. In 40 years, the rate of interest is reduced to 2½ per cent., and the annual charge on the original purchase Stocks stands at £837,500 The principle of a varying rate of interest is adopted in preference to power of redemption at intermediate periods, which, so far as can be foreseen, would probably yield at least as favourable results to the Water Trust, because an ascertained (though diminishing) rate of interest for the whole period of the stock would tend to maintain its market value at a more equable price, and thus be advantageous to bond fide investors. Current expenses, interest on debt, &c.—It is anticipated that these will be met by the revenue derivable from water rental, but provision is made for raising any deficiency by precept upon the local Eating Authorities (clause 21). The provisions of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, are followed in cases where the Eating Authority make default in paying the precept. Water rentals are to be collected by the Local Eating Authorities in the same manner as the poor rate, and subject to the like audit (clause 27). Surplus income of the Trust is to be applied to the equalization of water rents throughout the area of supply ; the improvement of the existing system of supply; and the reduction of water rents. The following table* shows the present inequality in the charges for water supply in the districts of the different companies. In each case a house of £50 rateable value, with one water-closet, is taken:— In the district of the:— £ s. d. Chelsea Company the annual charge is 240 East London ,, ,, 2 14 0 Grand Junction ,, ,, 240 Kent ,, ,, 2 10 0 Lambeth „ ,, 3 17 0 New Eiver „ ,, 2 4 0 Southwark and Yauxhali ,, 2 14 0 West Middlesex ,, ,, 2 4 0 It will thus be seen that the charge upon a £50 house varies from £2 4s. to £3 17s. per annum. * Evidence of Mr. S. Wood, Guildhall Inquiry, 1890. G 2 100 Audit.—The Accounts are to be kept in the form prescribed by the Local Government Board, and audited by an Auditor appointed by that Board (clause 29). Officers and Servants— Officers and servants in the service of the Companies are to be taken over by the Water Trust, or compensated (clauses 36 and 37). The Trust are to have full power to appoint officers (clause 35). Consultative Members.—To facilitate the transfer, power is taken to appoint not more than three consultative members for the first three years after the passing of the Act (clause 38). These members are to be selected from the chairmen, directors, or principal officers of the Companies, and are not to have power to vote. Miscellaneous.—The Water Trust are to provide offices (clause 39); may make bye-laws (clause 40); are to discharge debts and obligations of the Companies (clause 41); to continue or to suffer actions commenced by or against the Companies (clause 42); and to sell at their discretion superfluous lands (clause 47). The books and accounts of the Water Trust are to be open to inspection (clause 44). Power to County Council to carry Act into execution.—This part of the Act is practically an alternative proposal to the creation of a special Trust, as provided in the earlier part of the Act. Clause 54 provides that if at any time between the 1st November, end the 31st December, 1891, the London County Council shall, by a majority of the votes of the entire Council at a ppecial meeting convened for the purpose, so resolve, the Council shall become the Trustees for carrying the Act into execution, and the Act is to be read as if the Council were substituted throughout for the Water Trust. Subsequent clauses provide for the necessary alterations being made in the Act. The Vestry agree generally in the provisions of the Bill, with the exception of the manner in which it is proposed to constitute the new Water Authority. This Authority, the Vestry think, should be composed of members elected by (but not necessarily from among) the County Councils or local sanitary authorities having jurisdiction in the water 101 area, subject to this condition—that where the county or local area extends beyond the water area, only those members of the Council or local authority should elect who represent districts within the water area. At Lady-day the Bill was awaiting consideration by a select Committee of the House of Commons to whom the subject of the Water Supply of London, and the suburbs had been referred, with very wide powers. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. Session 1890.—The Central London Railway Bill, which was a Bill for constructing a railway from Queen's Road, Bayswater, to the City, at some depth below the surface of the streets along the line of the proposed route, passed the House of Commons with certain amendments, but failed to pass the House of Lords. The clause which the Vestry suggested, requiring payment of a sum of money to the London County Council for street improvements, as compensation for the land which would have been occupied by the railway, was not taken up by the Council, and the Vestry therefore did not press it. SESSION 1891.—The Central London Railway Bill of this session is a Bill to authorize the construction of a railway from Shepherd's Bush Green to the City. The only thoroughfare in this Parish which would be affected by the scheme is Oxford Street, and as the railway is to be constructed by boring, and the surface of the street is not to be disturbed, the Vestry have not thought it necessary to take any action beyond formally opposing the Bill with a view to obtain any amendments that might be required for the 102 protection of public or private rights of the parishioners. The promoters agreed to the insertion of a satisfactoryclause in the Bill, and it was therefore not deemed necessary to proceed with the opposition. It is proposed to work the railway by electricity. PROPOSED DISTRICT COUNCILS. Seeing how well, speaking generally, the improved system of local government inaugurated by the Metropolis Local Management Act has worked, the Vestry are not impressed with the necessity of any great change in the existing law. A local Vestry is usually a reflex of the public opinion of the locality, and, as might be expected, the same standard of excellence has not been attained by all the metropolitan Vestries. It is questionable, moreover, whether any improvement would be manifested if Vestries were superseded by bodies representing the same electors, even though their name were changed. In the month of May the Vestry expressed concurrence with the Vestry of Chelsea in an abstract proposition that it is desirable to preserve old landmarks in administrative areas, as far as possible, in any change in the system of local government, and a month later, upon the invitation of the same Vestry, appointed representatives to attend a Conference to consider the suggested formation of District Councils. As to the direction which reform in the local management of London should take, the Vestry see no reason to alter the opinion they expressed in a resolution in the year 1884, that any scheme "should simplify and unify the 103 system of local management in the various districts, by abolishing obsolete, conflicting, and overlapping bodies, and providing for the administration of local affairs on the same lines throughout the metropolis, by elected local authorities possessing precisely similar functions within their respective districts." Under such a scheme, there should be but two local bodies in each unit of administration: one to administer the poor law, and one to perform all other public duties of a municipal character, such as making and collecting the rates, the assessment of property, street lighting, paving, cleansing, vaccination and all other matters relating to the public health, registration of births and deaths, registration of voters, &c. The Vestry would regard with some apprehension any proposal to add local work to the London County Council, on the double ground that the central body would thereby be overweighted, and that any diminution of the importance and responsibilities of local bodies would have a tendency to reduce their prestige, and induce the leading parishioners to withdraw more than ever from active participation in local affairs. The question of area is purely a local matter, and should be decided with due consideration to the extreme desirability of maintaining and fostering a desire on the part of the inhabitants at large to take part in the administration of local affairs. The Vestry attach considerable importance to preserving the integrity of a parish with a history or associations strongly appealing to the sentiment of its inhabitants, and entertain grave doubts as to the wisdom of merging such a parish in a district distinguished by some name, which may in no way connect it with the past, and may destroy its identity in the present. 104 SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON. The still increasing cost of the School Board has naturally engaged much of the attention of the Rating Authorities, who are required by law to raise with their rates whatever sum the Board may call for. In the month of April the Vestry appointed three of their members to attend a Conference convened by the Vestry of Kensington, and acting upon a resolution adopted at the Conference, subsequently memorialized Her Majesty's Government for an amendment in the law to limit the rate to be levied by the School Board, and to apply various educational endowments in the metropolis in aid of the School Board rate. The Government, however, have not seen their way to take any action in the matter. In the month of May, the Vestry of Kensington brought under the notice of the Vestry certain alleged irregularities with regard to the acquisition of sites and erection of buildings by the London School Board. Deeming it of great importance that a public body expending nearly two millions of public money a year should not rest under any suspicion, the Vestry, without endorsing the allegations, urged upon the Government the desirability of a Royal Commission being appointed with ample powers to investigate and ascertain the truth of the allegations. A Royal Commission has, however, not yet been appointed. The precept served upon the Vestry by the School Board in July showed a further considerable increase, and was consequently referred to the Finance Committee for special report. The Committee did not feel justified in 105 mending the adoption of any action in the matter at that time, but submitted the following observations to the Vestry:— In the pamphlet published in the year 1888 by the Vestry on the subject of School Board administration, a comparative statement was given of the cost for school maintenance in London Board Schools and elsewhere, from which it appeared that while the net cost in London Board Schools under this head was estimated for that year at £1 17s. 3d. per scholar (it actually amounted to 1d. more), in London Voluntary Schools it was only 12s. 10d., and in Board Schools throughout Englard and Wales, excluding London, the average was only 12s. 4¼d., or less than one-third of the cost in London Board Schools. School maintenance does not inolude the purchase of land, erection of schools, repayment of loans, interest, or establishment charges. The extra cost of land and bailding in the Metropolis, and the heavy expenses incurred for administration in London, therefore do not affect the question. The Board elected in 1885, as appears from their completed accounts, was the only Beard that kept the cost of school maintenance at anything approaching a fixed sum. The cost for their three years of office was respectively 37s. 1d., 37s. 1d., and 37s. 4d. per scholar ; the cost for the first completed year of the Board elected in 1888 was 41s. 9d., while for the current year it is estimated at 45s. l½d. per scholar, an increase of 7s. 9½d. per scholar in two years. The average attendance of scholars has increased in the meantime by a trifle less than 7,000, or less than the normal increase in the population, notwithstanding there are many vacant places in the Board Schools. It may be assumed therefore that the Board have overtaken the deficiency of school accommodation which existed in 1870, and that the future amount of the School Board rate will depend mainly upon the care exercised by the Board in administrative details. An increase of 7s. 9½d. per scholar represents a total of £136,077 18s. 11d. upon the average attendance (349,291), and is equivalent to a rate of more than 1d. in the £. 106 It may be mentioned that this increase extends over every item, as the following statement will show :— Cost per Scholar in 1888-9 (actual). Cost in 1890-91 (estimated). £ s. d. £ s. d. Salaries of Teachers 2 8 9 2 12 0 Books. Apparatus, and Stationery 0 1 10 0 3 0 Wages of School-keepers and Cleaners 0 2 7 0 2 9f Rates and Bents 0 3 11 0 4 2 Fuel and Light 0 1 4 0 1 10 Repairs to Buildings and Furniture 0 2 9 0 4 3½ Pupil Teachers' Schools 0 0 7 0 0 8¾ Sundries 0 1 4 0 2 11 3 3 1 3 11 9 Recoupments:— £ s. d. £ s. d.

It commences with an outlay of £2.000, but judging from past experience of the School Board is not likely to remain at that figure. Whether "Laundry Work and Manual Work" can properly be classed under the head of "Elementary Education" is a question upon which perhaps the ratepayers may like to express their opinion. It may also be remarked that the salaries of inspectors, instructors, &c., and sundries have increased in two years by 50 per cent., or from £22,798 18s. 3d. to £34,000, and that this year £15,000 is provided for " contingencies." 107 Supplementing the foregoing Report, the following statement of the sums levied in rates by the School Board for London each year since its creation, shows the rapid growth in the demands of the Board. In addition to rates, the Board derives an income from Government Grants and the School Fees of Scholars:— Year. Annual Rateable Value.

The first new school erected by the Board was opened in July 1873, and it was some ten years later before the Board had adequately provided accommodation for the population of London of a school-age, and not otherwise provided for. The following comparative statement of the cost of the School Board during the second complete year of the Board * elected in November, 1885, and the second complete year of the Board elected in November, 1888, illustrates the alarming manner in which the cost of the Board is increasing:— Loans Account (Principal and Interest). School Maintenance (Day Schools only). Industrial Schools and Evening Classes. Office & Legal Expenses and Enforcement of Compulsion. School Buildings not chargeable to Capital, and Stamp Duty.

At this Conference resolutions were passed to petition for the appointment of a Royal Commission to enquire into the cause of the extravagant expenditure of the Board; endorsing the action of a Committee of ratepayers in proposing to present, by deputation, a memorial to the Board, complaining of extravagant expenditure; and expressing an opinion that the Board has not kept to the spirit of the Act by which it was created. 109 In the month of November, a deputation of ratepayers requested the Vestry to allow a memorial to the School Board, protesting against the enormous expenditure of the Board, to lie in the Vestry Hall for signature, and this the Vestry readily assented to, without expressing any opinion on the memorial itself. More recently, a statement has been largely circulated among the ratepayers, with a view to inform them on the growing cost of the School Board, in the hope that a strenuous effort will be made at the approaching election of the Board to secure the return of qualified candidates. The Vestry are convinced, from a careful consideration of the whole facts of the case, so far as they have been able to gather them from official documents, that the London School Board Rate might be reduced by nearly 3d. in the pound by careful administration. What the rate will amount to in the near future depends upon the choice of the Electors in November next. SCHOOL BOARD ELECTORAL AREAS. In addition to petitioning in favour of the School Board Elections Bill, which proposes to assimilate the School Board electoral area with the Parliamentary constituencies, the Vestry appointed two of their members, on the invitation of the St. Pancras Vestry, to join a proposed deputation to the Education Department in support of the Bill. The Department, however, declined to receive the deputation on the ground that the Bill is not one for which it is responsible. 110 The Vestry believe that the passing of some such Bill, by reducing the School Board constituencies to more manageable dimensions, would beneficially react on the administration of the Board in consequence of the members being kept more in touch with their constituents. TREES IN STREETS The Vestry have again had under consideration the desirability of planting trees in some of the wider thoroughfares in this Parish, but it appearing that it would be impossible, in consequence of the existence of vaults, to obtain a sufficient depth of soil to justify a reasonable hope of a healthy growth of trees planted at regular intervals,, the Vestry have not seen their way to take any action in the matter. While the subject was under consideration the Vestry, received an offer from the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association of £100 for planting trees in the streets. For the reason above stated, this offer was courteously declined. STATUE OF LORD NAPIER. The Vestry have assented to an equestrian statue of the late Lord Napier of Magdala being placed in Waterloo Place, between the Athenaeum Club and the United Service Club. A model of the statue was placed in position prior to this assent having being given. 111 THE "UNEMPLOYED. The unusually prolonged frost during the winter brought in its train, as might be expected, a certain amount of suffering and distress among those who were deprived of work by the inclemency of the weather. The snowstorms and the sheets of ice in the public parks, however, afforded temporary employment to a large number of unskilled labourers in this and other Parishes, and no doubt tended to prevent the number of persons in receipt of poor-law relief increasing, at least in western London, to the extent that might have been anticipated. A communication which the Yestry received from the President of the Local Government Board, on the subject of relief works had in fact been anticipated by the employment of a large number of men in the work of snow removal. INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF HYGIENE AND DEMOGRAPHY. Upon the invitation of Sir Douglas Galton, Chairman of the Organizing Committee, the Vestry have nominated two of their members to attend this Congress, which is to be held in August next under the presidency of the Prince of Wales. The Yestry have also intimated their desire to afford every facility for any members of the Congress inspecting the arrangements in use in this Parish for the disinfection of clothing and bedding, the reception of the dead and other details of sanitary work. 112 EMERGENCY EXIT, PRINCE'S HALL. Upon the application of the Piccadilly Art Galleries Company, the Yestry assented to the Rector and Churchwardens entering into an agreement with the directors of the Company, for the opening of a doorway from Prince's Hall into the Churchyard, for use in case of emergency. The Yestry subsequently learned, however, that the Rector and Churchwardens were advised that the doorway could not be formed except under special parliamentary authority. ST. PAUL'S SCHOOL. The Yestry received a communication from the Vestry of Fulham with reference to the manner in which the scheme relating to the government of St. Paul's School is being administered. Without committing themselves to every statement contained in this communication, the Yestry considered the subject worthy of investigation, and informed the Yestry of Fulham to that effect. SUNDAY BAWLING. At the invitation of the Yestry of St. George, Hanover Square, the Yestry have appointed two of their members to join a deputation to the Home Secretary to invite his assistance in suppressing the annoyance caused by street vendors on Sundays. 113 CONCLUDING REMARKS. The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellow-parishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner as possible, a statement of the principles which have guided them in the discharge of their trust, and particulars of the present condition of the parish. By Order, HARRY WILKINS, Vestry Cleric. H 115 Supplemental Report of Works EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER, DURING THE YEAR 1890-91. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, W. Surveyor's Department. June, 1891. To the Vestry of St. James, Westminster. Rev. Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the following statement of Works executed between the 26th March, 1890, and the 25th March, 1891. ROADS. During the past year 382 tons 1 cwt. 1 qr. of granite, supplied by Messrs. J. Mowlem and Co., of Westminster, were used upon the parish roads. 116 The macadam roadways became very rotten after the severe frosts of last winter, and in consequence, much more repairs were needed than would have been the case in the ordinary way. Thirty-one thousand nine hundred and forty-six superficial yards of road surface have been rolled and consolidated by the 8-ton steam roller and the 4-horse roller. One thousand two hundred and twelve openings have been made by the Gas, Water, Electric Light, and Hydraulic Power Companies and the Post Office. The areas disturbed being:— Pitching 900 5/18 yards super. Macadam 735 17/18 do. Wood 893 8/9 do. Asphalte 534 2/27 do. Footway 61,869 feet super. Kerb 947 feet run. New York Stone 6,487 feet super. Concrete Paving 465 square yards. Concrete 44 1/9 cubic yards. New York Stone Landings 651/7 square feet. New Kerb 3 1/5 feet run. New Pitching 2 tons 17 cwt. 2 qrs. Plug Boxes, &c. 27 let into pavement. These surfaces were made good at the expense of the Companies the total amount chargeable to them for the year being £2,153 9s. 117 REPAIRS TO STREETS. The cost of the General Repairs, &c., to streets executed by men in the employ of your Vestry, is as follows:— £ s. d. Air Street 2 16 8 Arundell Street 1 7 10 Babmaes Mews 1 13 9 Beak Street 0 6 5 Bury Street 17 15 10 Burlington Gardens 7 10 0 Cleveland Row 1 14 6 Cleveland Square 4 19 10 Clifford Street 57 10 6 Cork Street 1 6 Denman Street 1 11 2 Duke Street 106 4 6 Eagle Place 0 12 8 Edward Street 1 8 5 Foubert's Place 5 0 10 Glasshouse Street 0 19 3 Golden Square 35 7 1 Harris's Place 0 13 4 Haymarket 39 13 5 Heddon Street 3 5 11 Little St. James's Street 12 10 8 Little Marlborough Street 1 10 3 New Burlington Street 36 13 11 Ormond Yard 19 14 2 Pall Mali 14 1 5 Piccadilly 33 8 3 Piccadilly Cirous 48 8 0 Piccadilly Place 0 6 5 Ramilies Street 8 4 5 Regent Street 113 14 11 Rupert Street 1 13 10 St. James's Place 12 6 8 Sackville Street 90 19 9 Carried forward £693 6 1 118  £ S. d.

Argyll Street 7 14 4 Charles Street 3 16 8 Coventry Street 55 9 11 George Street 1 2 3 Jermyn Street 50 10 2 Pall Mall 51 1 1 Piccadilly 55 18 10 Piccadilly Circus 4 0 6 Regent Street 98 15 9 St. James's Street 10 0 5 Shaftesbury Avenue 22 10 7 Wardour Street 13 1 3 £374 1 9 The wood paving in the main thoroughfares is very severely tested by the enormous number of omnibuses using these streets in consequence of the narrow wheels 119 they have for the heavy weight they carry, and it has been necessary to entirely relay the paving at the regular stopping-places in Regent Street and Piccadilly. ASPHALTE. Ingestre Court was paved with Asphalte in July last by the French Asphalte Company at a cost of 7s. 6d. per square yard. The area of the court is 99½ square yards, and it is paved with 1-inch of compressed asphalte on 4-inch of Portland cement concrete. The previous paving was York Stone. WOOD PAVING. In August last the Wood Paving of Regent Street and Waterloo Place below Piccadilly, which had been down eight years, was taken up by the Improved Wood Pavement Company and replaced with new 6in. by 3in. by 9in. yellow deal blocks laid upon the old concrete foundation after all defective places in the foundation had been made good. The area of the new paving was 6,659 5/9 square yards, and the cost 6s. per square yard. FOOTWAYS. The following work was carried out on the footways:— York stone relaid, 25,636 square feet, granite kerb reset, 878 feet run. These dimensions include 5,106 square feet of new York stone, and 143 feet run of new kerb. The footway paving and kerbing of Lower Regent Street (east side), Pall Mall (between the Opera Colonnade and Waterloo 120 Place), Ormond Yard and Jermyn Street (between the Criterion and Regent Street) were taken up and relaid, and also small portions of the footway paving of sundry other streets. OLD MATERIALS. The quantities of old materials sold were 273 square feet of York stone paving. REFUGE. At the request of the Commissioner of Police the Refuge on the north side of Piccadilly Circus was moved about 16 feet farther north to give the vehicular traffic more room to turn. BURY STREET. On the 20th September last half the roadway slipped in at the lower end of Bury Street in consequence of the shores in the excavation for the new building at the corner of Bury Street and King Street giving way, but fortunately no one was injured. The roadway was made good again as speedily as possible. HYDRAULIC MAINS. During the year the London Hydraulic Power Company have laid a new main in Jermyn Street from St.. James's Street to No. 71, Jermyn Street. 121 ARTESIAN WELL, MASON'S YARD. An artesian tube well has been bored by the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company at their Station in Mason's Yard, Duke Street. It commences in the basement, 20 feet below the surface of the yard. A well, five feet in diameter, and 15 feet deep, was first dug, and from this point to 400 feet from the surface of the yard a boring was made, and an 11½ inch tube was inserted. Water was struck at a depth of 262 feet, and now rises to within 150 feet of the surface. The pump extends into the tube to 220 feet from the surface of the yard, and will be worked by a six-horse engine, fixed over the well. The pump is capable of throwing 7,000 gallons of water per hour, which is the quantity expected. ELECTRIC LIGHT CONDUCTORS. Electric Light Conductors have been laid in portions of the following streets, viz.:— By the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company : Air Street, Burlington Gardens, Denman Street, Duke Street, Glasshouse Street, Jermyn Street, Mason's Yard, Ormond Yard, Pall Mall, Piccadilly, Regent Street, Sackville Street, St. James's Place, Savilc How, Shaftesbury Avenue, Sherwood Street, Swallow Street, Vigo Street, and Waterloo Place. By the London Electric Supply Corporation : Burlington Gardens, Charles Street, Clifford Street, Cork Street, Duke Street, Glasshouse Street, Haymarket, King Street 122 (St. James's Square), New Burlington Street, Pall Mall, Piccadilly, Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street, St. James's Square, St. James's Street, Savile Row, Vigo Street, Waterloo Place, and York Street. By the Westminster Electric Supply Company : Piccadilly, from Albemarle Street to Old Bond Street, and Regent Street, between Maddox Street and Conduit Street. STREET NAMES. Additional street names have been put up in the undermentioned places, viz.:—Black Lion Court, Eagle Place, Glasshouse Street, Mason's Yard, Upper James Street, Wardour Street, and Warwick Street. LICENCES Have been granted for the erection of one hundred and fifteen hoardings and scaffolds for the purposes of re-building, alterations, &c. Licence has also been given in 26 cases to open the roadway to repair water pipes, or for similar purposes. The cost of making good these openings is charged to the persons taking out the Licences. COAL PLATES. During the past twelve months fifty-one coal plates were cut into the paving. 123 FIRE ALARMS. Additional fire alarms have been fixed by the London County Council in Regent Street, at the corner of Conduit Street, and in St. James's Square, at the corner of Charles Street. LIGHTING. The maintenance and painting of the street lanterns and lamp columns, which were formerly done by the Gas Company, are now carried out for the Vestry by contract The contractors, for the first part of the year, were Messrs. S. Pontifex & Co., of 22, Coleman Street, E.C., and the last, Messrs. R. and J. Shiers, of 5, King Street, Regent, Street, W. One new lamp has been fixed, and one shifted, in both Bridle Lane and Crown Court (Pall Mall). The refuge lamps are furnished with a "midnight arrangement," and a man is employed by your Vestry to light, extinguish, and clean these lamps and those in the urinals, and also to reduce the light at 12 o'clock at night. SEWERS. Repairs have been carried out to the sewers in King's Arms Yard, Cork Mews, Ingestre Place, and Jermyn Street. Several of the small subsidiary sewers running under the vaults of the houses in Regent Street have been partially blocked. In each case the stoppage was removed, and where found necessary the old barrel drain destroyed and earthenware pipes substituted. 124 The cost of repairing sewers, bricking up old disused drains, new side entrance covers, manholes, &c., amounted to the sum of £59 4s. 4d. for the year. GULLIES. Thirteen gullies have been reconstructed, and sundry others repaired, at a cost of £49 19s. 1d. The new ones are situate as follows:— Clifford Street 1 Cork Mews 1 Golden Square 6 Great Marlborough Street 1 King Street (St. James's Square) 1 Old Burlington Street 2 Wardour Street 1 13 CLEANSING SEWERS AND GULLIES. The cost of labour for cleansing the sewers was £156 17s. 10d.,and for emptying 1,819 gullies, £71 8s. 5d., the accumulations removed from the sewers and gullies being carted away by the slopping contractor, under his contract, without extra expense to the Vestry. CONNECTIONS TO SEWERS. Twenty-eight new connections from houses have been made to the sewers by men in the employ of your Vestry. EXAMINING OUTLETS TO DRAINS. Examinations of outlets of drains have been made in ten cases. The fee for each examination is five shillings 125 FLUSHING. The small sewers and courts were flushed at intervals during the hot weather as found necessary. The cost of water was £98 18s. 11d.; labour, £10 3s. 1d.; and repairs to hose, £13 0s. 7d. DISINFECTING. The gullies and market streets were regularly disinfected during the summer months. The disinfectants used for all purposes amounted to 574 gallons of carbolic acid, and 2 cwt. of chloride of lime, costing £20 8s. URINALS. The saving of water at the Urinals throughout the Parish continues to be very great in consequence of the general adoption of the trough system, while at the same the Urinals are much sweeter. Excluding the Conveniences at Piccadilly Circus, the water has cost £49 4s. 5d. this year, as against £48 8s. last year. In former years it was close upon £120 per annum. A constant supply of water is now laid on to all the Urinals in the parish except one, and the automatic apparatus belonging to the latter is worked from a tank fixed above the urinal, which is filled daily from the Water Company's mains. The iron roof of the urinal in Bridle Lane has been removed, and a glass one, protected with wire netting fixed 126 in lieu thereof. The cost of alterations, repairs and cleansing has been £104 5s. 6d. The repairs are principally making good wilful damage caused by persons unknown, and repairing pipes, &c., burst during the frost. PICCADILLY CONVENIENCES. In consequence of the enormous use made of these conveniences (some 3,000,000 persons going down in twelve months), the York stone steps to the men's side became so badly worn as to be dangerous, and accordingly the treads were cut down in December last by the Vestry's own men, and re-faced with Doulton's silicated stoneware treads at a cost of £23 19s. 5d. These treads, at the present time, do not show any signs of wear. The general repairs and alterations to the other parts of the structure were carried out at an expense to the Vestry of £63 2s. 5d. The cost of gas, including that consumed in the large lamps outside, was £86 12s„ and of water £99 7s. 6d., while the electric light, which was fitted up by the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company of Mason's Yard, Duke Street, St. James's, at a cost of £30 was supplied with current for one year, free of cost, to the Vestry. MACHINE BROOMS, &c. The machine brooms required refilling with new bass on the average once in five weeks. The cost of sundry repairs and re-fillings; hand brooms and brushes for Orderly Boys, amounted to the sum of £125 15s. 127 WATERING. The street watering throughout the year was carried out by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a shedule of prices. The water is supplied by the Grand Junction Water Works Company by contract. The cost of team labour, &c.,was £430 19s. 4d., and water £401 16s. 5d. STAND POSTS. The stand post opposite No. 27, Great Marlborough Street, was removed, and a new one fixed in lieu thereof by the side of the refuge in the centre of the street opposite the Police Court. New Stand Posts have been purchased during the year, for fixing in place of those beyond repair, the cost of which added to the cost of repacking, and sundry repairs to existing posts amounted to £69 5s. 10d. The repairs to stand posts have been far more extensive than usual, owing to the very severe winter, and the action of frost upon the services and connections. SNOW, &c. The past winter has been one of exceptional severity, trying not only the scavengers, but more especially the resources of the Contractors, who remove the refuse, &c., from the streets, most severely as will be gathered from the fact that the natural outlet from the Contractors Wharf (The Grand Junction Canal), was frozen over and impassable for boats for no less than seven weeks without a break, during the whole of which time the refuse, &c., was regularly removed from the Parish. 128 During the winter there were five heavy snowstorms, viz: on the 28th November, the 15th December, the 19th and 20th December, the 8th January, and the 9th, 10th, and 11th March. The first snowfall on the 28th November, was two inches in thickness, and 30 tons of salt were used for melting the snow, but as the whole did not dissolve, horses and carts were obtained, and 155 cubic yards were carted to the Thames Embankment and cast into the river. The streets were all cleared before night. The second snowfall on the 15th December, was also about two inches in thickness, but was dissolved without much difficulty before night by the use of 22 tons of salt. The third snowfall occurred on the 19th and 20th December. The fall on the 19th December was five inches in thickness, and nearly as much more fell on the 20th, but although a good deal of the latter thawed soon after it fell, it had the effect of making those thoroughfares which had previously been cleared very dirty. On this occasion, notwithstanding that 46 tons of salt were used, it was necessary to cart away to the River and elsewhere 6,067 cubic yards of consolidated snow. The snow was removed from all the streets, mews and courts in the parish, before Christmas Day, except from less than a dozen short thoroughfares, measuring in all 1¼ miles in which there is comparatively little traffic. During the Christmas season great difficulty was experienced in obtaining horses and carts, but the whole of the streets, &c., were thoroughly clcared by the 31st December. The fourth snowfall, on the 8th January, was about three inchess in thickness, 29 tons of salt were used, and 728 cubic yards of snow taken to the river. 129 The fifth and last snowstorm, on the 9th, 10th and 11th March, was very heavy. Snow commenced to fall at 4 p.m. on the 9th, and continued incessantly until between 6 and 7 a.m. on the 11th March. The snow which fell on this occasion attained a depth of six inches, but the whole was removed by the 13th March. In all, 15 tons of salt were used and 2,786 cubic yards of snow carted to the river, and 450 cubic yards elsewhere. ORDERLY BOYS. There are now fifteen Orderly Boys at work in the main thoroughfares, under the direction of a Foreman. It is a difficult matter to keep them constantly at their duties, but nevertheless they pick up a large quantity of horse droppings in the course of the day which would otherwise be carried all over the streets. Bins for the reception of the horse droppings are fixed in the streets at suitable places for their use. DUSTING AND SLOPPING. The contract for dusting and slopping was carried out by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a cost of £4,500. I am, Rev. Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY MONSON, Assoc. M.

Report upon Articles Analyzed during year 1890 202 179 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS of the VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, for the year 1890. The figures given by the Census of 1891 are not yet available, but it will probably appear that, since 1881, the changes that have occurred in St. James's have caused a considerable reduction in the resident population. In that case a corresponding correction will have to be made in the estimated death rates for recent years. The Census of 1881 gives the District of the Parish of St. James's as covering an area of 162 acres, and containing a population of 29,865. The Golden Square Sub.District appears as covering an area of 54 acres, and containing a population of 11,585. M 2 180 The Berwick Street Sub.District appears as covering an area of 108 acres, and containing a population of 18,280. Taking these data from the Census, the mean density of the population of the whole District appears as 184 per acre, while the density of the population of the Golden Square Sub.District appears as 215 persons per acre, and that of the Berwick Street Sub.District as 169 persons per acre. The mean density of the population in Registration London is 52.9 persons to the acre. During the year 1890 the death.rate of Registration London has been 20.3 per 1,000; the death.rate of Greater London has been 19.4 per 1,000; the death.rate of England and Wales has been 19.2 per 1,000. It will be seen that the death.rate of London for the year 1890 was higher than its death.rate for any one of the five preceding years, and was an interruption to the almost unbroken fall in the London mortality that began in 1879. This increase is partly accounted for by the inclusion in the London mortality this year, for the first time, of the deaths of Londoners occurring in outlying institutions. Against these deaths, as affecting the District of St. James's, Westminster, are to be set the deaths of strangers who come to London for medical advice and die in the wards of London hospitals and infirmaries, and in hotels and lodging houses. A very large number of hotels and lodging houses exist in St. James's, and in St. James's these deaths have been taken as balancing those from St. James's occurring in outlying institutions, though the deaths of strangers occurring in the Union House, and in 181 the Throat Hospital, being precisely ascertainable, have been deducted from the gross mortality occurring in St. James's. For the year 1891 the deaths of persons from St. James's reported as dying in outlying Institutions have, for the first time, been shown in the periodical reports to the Vestry. The epidemic termed Influenza caused a great rise in pulmonary deaths during January and December, 1890. The net mortality in the Parish of St. James during the year 1890 was 340 deaths. Taking the population at 29,865—340 deaths gives a death.rate of 11 38 per 1,000. The deaths occuring in St. James's from Zymotic diseases during the year 1890 have been 26. Of Zymotic disease 77 cases came under notice during the year. Of these 77 cases, 11 were Diphtheria, 7 were Typhoid Fever, and 52 were Scarlet Fever; 1 was returned as "Continued Fever," there was 1 case of Croup and 5 cases of Erysipelas. Of these 77 cases, 43 were removed out of the Parish, 39 to extra.Parochial Fever or other Hospitals, 4 to their own homes; 34 of the 77 cases were not removed. During the year 1890, 27 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. In several cases bodies were removed from the presence of families living in a single room. One body was removed from the Union House, and one from the Throat Hospital. Sixteen inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 16 post.mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room which adjoins the Mortuary. 182 The following numbers of deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's during the year 1890:— First Quarter 91 Second Quarter 76 Third Quarter 91 Fourth Quarter 1ll Deaths in St. James's during the year 1890 Deduct deaths of Non.Parishioners:— Dying in the Union.House Dying in the Throat Hospital 369 27 2 29 Net mortality in St. James's for the year 1890 310 For a population of 29,865, 340 deaths would be a death. rate of 11.38 for each 1,000 persons living in the parish. The net mortality occurring in St. James's has been tinuously decreasing. These facts, for the last 10 years, are shown in the following table, but, until the result of the new. Census appear, it is not possible to predicate the changes which have taken place in the population of St. James's since 1881:— Gross Mortality. Net Mortality. Deaths per 1,000.

REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1890, MADE TO THE Vestrn of St. James's, Stostminstyr, BY JAS. EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P., Loud., F.R.M.S., P.C.S., &c., Medical Officer of Health and, Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen,— During the year 1890, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, 53 samples were examined, all which were procured for examination by the Chief Sanitary Inspector. Among the articles examined during the year 1890, were samples of "Vinegar" and samples of "Milk of Sulphur." On these samples some comment may be made. Four samples of vinegar were examined and were found to yield the following percentage of real acetic acid (C2 H4 o2). No. 50 yielded 7.95 per cent. of real acetic acid. „ 51 „ 3.45 „ „ ,, 52 ,, 2.85 „ „ „ 53 ,, 4.35 „ „ 203 It will be seen that among these samples of "vinegar" sold in St. James's, some were little more than one-third the strength of others. Thereupon the question arose, "What is vinegar?" What percentage of acetic acid should the consumer get when he buys "vinegar?" So far as I could discover, these questions had never been legally determined. Vinegar is sold as malt vinegar, or wine vinegar Malt vinegar should be made by the fermentation of malt liquor, wine vinegar by the fermentation of wine. But, as almost all the "brandy" now sold is made from potatoes instead of being made from grapes, so acetic acid is largely made by the destructive distillation of wood, and such acetic acid is indistinguishable, chemically or dietetically, from the acetic acid which is formed by fermentation in malt or wine vinegars. Such acetic acid (pyroligneous acid) is largely used in the manufacture or fortification of vinegars, and, if pure and skilfully flavoured, I am not aware that it would be in any way inferior for table use or for the making of pickles. In examining vinegars for the protection of the consumer, the other questions to be settled are the presence of poisonous substances, such as lead, and the presence of mineral acids in place of acetic acid. By the Vinegar Act (58 Geo. III., cap. 65):— "Proof vinegar is such strength of acetous acid that 100 parts by weight will neutralise 14.5 parts by weight of crystallised carbonate of soda." Proof Vinegar thus defined contains 6 per cent. of real acetic or acetous acid (C2 H4 O2). Upon the plea that vinegar made by the acetous fermentation of saccharine or alcoholic liquors would not keep, the 204 Vinegar Act allowed as much as one-thousandth part by weight of oil of vitrol, sulphuric acid (H2 S O4), to be added. The best vinegar makers do not find it necessary to use oil of vitrol, but the presence of sulphuric acid—not exceeding one-thousandth part of the weight of the vinegar—could not be treated in law as an adulteration. The presence of this amount of sulphuric acid would greatly sharpen the acidity of the vinegar, but such acidity would not count, inasmuch as what the purchaser of "vinegar " demands is "acetous acid" The presence of mineral acids other than sulphuric would be an adulteration. As to the four samples of vinegar submitted for analysis in 1890, none contained more than such traces of sulphuric acid as would be found combined with lime in ordinary London drinking water. None contained lead or other poisonous impurity. The only question therefore that arose was, What percentage of acetous acid is a purchaser entitled to when he demands "vinegar ?" Now "proof vinegar," "standard vinegar," or 6 per cent. vinegar is known as "No. 24." But other strengths, mostly by the addition of water, are manufactured and sold in the trade as No. 22, No. 20, No. 18, and No. 16. These numbers having respectively 11/12ths, 10/12ths, 9/12ths. and 8/12ths of the acetous acid contained in "proof vinegar" or "No. 24." And among inferior manufacturers the vinegars sold under these numbers will fall below the above strengths. Taking the lowest recognised number, "No. 16," that number should contain 4 per cent. of real acetous acid (C2 H4 O2). Thereupon I advised the Sanitary Committee that all vinegars not containing 4 per cent. of real acetous acid should be treated as adulterated with added water; but "hat at present the vendor of sample No. 51, containing 205 3.45 per cent. of real acetous acid should be warned by a letter from the Vestry Clerk, while a test prosecution should be instituted against the vendor of "sample No. 52," which contained only 2.85 per cent. of real acetous acid. The Sanitary Committee resolved accordingly. Notice was then given by a solicitor on behalf of the vendor (really on behalf of the wholesale houses) that the prosecution would be fought, and upon that becoming clear the magistrate adjourned the case. When the trial came on the resistance collapsed. The vendor pleaded guilty, and a fine of twenty shillings and costs was imposed. It will be observed that in deciding upon such prosecutions the real difficulty encountered by the Vestry is to settle what the purchaser is entitled to expect when he asks for a particular article which, like "vinegar," has no precise legal standard settled for it, or in which general custom has debased the standard. "Vinegar," when sold by a druggist, must be sold according to the standard fixed by the British Pharmacopoeia, and that standard requires it to contain 5.41 per cent. of real acetous acid. It would be much better, in my opinion, if the standard, or Proof Vinegar," as defined by the Vinegar Act, containing 6 per cent. of real acetous acid, and known as "No. 24 vinegar," were legalised as what a purchaser is entitled to have when he asks for "vinegar." The lower strengths do not keep so well, and they are prepared mostly by the addition of water. Of "Milk of sulphur," 13 samples were submitted for analysis. Of these 13 samples 11 were found to be pure precipitated sulphur, while No. 29 was found to contain 10.8 per cent. of anhydrous gypsum, or sulphate of lime (Ca S O4); and No. 32 contained 38.5 per cent. of the same lime salt. 206 Thereupon I reported to the Sanitary Committee that the presence of sulphate of lime in milk of sulphur was an adulterant, and I recommended prosecutions. The Sanitary Committee adopted the recommendation. In these milk of sulphur cases, again, the accuracy of the analyses was not disputed, but an obstinate fight was made upon the ground that "Milk of sulphur" was expected by the purchaser to contain sulphate of lime. The real strength of the defendant's position lay in the fact that in some previous cases the magistrates had refused to convict, or the conviction had been over-ruled by Quarter Sessions. In point of fact, those cases had been prosecuted in a perfunctory way, while the defendants had fought the question with great skill and tenacity, and I reported to the Sanitary Committee that, in my opinion chose decisions would be reversed if the matter were carried to a higher court, and that public policy required their reversal. After a long and patient hearing by Mr. Hannay at Marlborough Street, the learned magistrate adjourned the case in order to look up the subject, and upon its coming on again he saw so much difficulty in over-ruling a former decision of Quarter Sessions that he again adjourned the case sine die. This course on the part of the magistrate left the defendants mulcted by the payment of all their costs unless they applied again for a decision, and tendered evidence to rebut the presumption raised by the evidence of the Public Analyst. No further application has been made by the defendants, and that prosecution will probably prevent the future sale as "milk of sulphur" of precipitated sulphur adulterated with plaster of Paris. There is, in my opinion, no excuse in law for the sale of anything but pure precipitated sulphur when "milk of 207 sulphur" is demanded. Pereira, the greatest of our writers on Materia Medica, so long back as 1849 put this question quite clearly, and he defined "Milk of Sulphur" as meaning "Precipitated Sulphur," but, in the absence of an adulteration act, it was not practicable then to repress the adulteration. The following extract is from Pereira's Materia Medica, 1849, vol. I., page 346 :— "The precipitated sulphur of commerce is most "extensively adulterated with sulphate of lime. In its "preparation sulphuric acid has been substituted for "hydrochloric acid, by which the product contains nearly "two-thirds its weight of crystallized sulphate of lime. "The adulterated variety is paler than the pure prepara"tion, and by artificial light it has a glistening or satiny "appearance owing to the presence of the crystals of "sulphate of lime.'' In face of such a protest it would seem difficult to attempt to palliate this miserable adulteration of a medicine which is largely used among poor people, and it is obviously unfair that out of thirteen druggists, of whom eleven are conscientious enough to sell only pure sulphur, two should sell their sulphur mixed with lime sulphate. The mere fact that "milk of sulphur," if bought at one shop, is pure sulphur, while, if bought at another, it contains 10.8 per cent. of sulphate of lime, and, at another, contains 38.5 per cent. of this adulterant (equal to more than half its weight of plaster of Paris as it would be scraped off a statuette), is enough to condemn the practice as being not only fraudulent but dangerous, inasmuch as the sick person would never be sure of what he was taking. Yet an obstinate defence on the part of the trade was made to this prosecution. Reference 208 was made to an obsolete Pharmacopœa published in 1721, and in which sulphuric acid was unwittingly ordered, although in every Pharmacopœa issued since that date hydrochloric acid has been ordered for the precipitation of sulphur in order to obviate the contamination of the product with a precipitate of lime. It was also urged that sulphur thus contaminated with lime would mix more readily with water. This is quite true, and the answer is that if the "milk of sulphur" were wholly plaster of Paris it would mix still more readily with water. The answer also is that milk of sulphur is never taken in water, but always in milk or in treacle, and that with either of these vehicles it mixes perfectly. The pretence that the public require their milk of sulphur to have the satiny appearance conferred by the mixture of lime is refuted by the fact that eleven druggists out of thirteen sold pure sulphur when asked for "milk of sulphur." In none of the samples was any poisonous ingredient discovered. No money or consideration other than the stipend paid by the Yestry has been received by me in connection with these analyses.
