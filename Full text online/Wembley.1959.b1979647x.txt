Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1959. This report has been compiled in the following five chapters, three with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services. Chapter I VITAL STATISTICS, Page 6, Statistical Appendix A, Pages 7—13. ” II GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES, Pages 14—17. „ III INFECTIOUS DISEASES, Pages 18—19, Statistical Appendix B, Pages 20—25. „ IV ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE, FOOD AND WATER, HOUSING, FACTORIES, ETC., Pages 26—33, Statistical Appendix C, Pages 34—50. ” V ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND STAFF, Page 51. 5 CHAPTER I. VITAL STATISTICS 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1959 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 126,300 and whilst this is considerably below 131,384 the census figure for 1951 it probably represents the most accurate figure attainable. It is an interesting observation that the population of Wembley and Kingsbury recorded in the census of 1931 was some 65,799, an inter-census increase of 99.7%. Wembley remains the fifth largest County District in Middlesex, those greater, according to population, being Harrow, Ealing, Willesden and Hendon. 2. In 1959 there were recorded 1,593 live births, giving a crude birth rate of 12.6 per thousand estimated population. The RegistrarGeneral has provided boroughs with a comparability factor for this calculation which takes into account the relative proportion of women of child bearing age in the total community. When this factor of 1.01 is applied the standardised birth rate becomes 12.7, a more realistic figure, the origin of which, however, must be remembered when comparing it with past years. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 14.4 is below the national rate for England and Wales, yet one feels some comment is not out of place. Prematurity continues to be the main cause of neonatal death and the emergency unit maintained at the Edgware General Hospital is of advantage in cases of prematurity, probably keeping this rate to an absolute minimum. 4. The number of deaths totalled 1,219, giving a crude death rate of 9.7 per thousand. The comparability factor when applied produces a standardised death rate of 11.3, an increase on last year's figure but below the national rate. 6 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital is administered by the Mount Vernon Group, and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the West Hendon Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included:— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 2381.) Wembley Hospital, Fairview Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex. (WEMbley 3136.) Kingsbury Maternity Hospital, Honeypot Lane, Kingsbury, N.W.9. (COLindale 6309.) * Neasden Hospital, Brentfield Road, Neasden, N.W.10. (WILlesden 2251.) West Hendon Hospital, Goldsmith Avenue, Hendon, N.W.9. (COLindale 8182.) 14 Willesden Chest Clinic, Pound Lane, Willesden, N.W.10. (WILlesden 6254.) Harrow Chest Clinic, 199, Station Road, Harrow, Middlesex. (HARrow 1075.) Edgware Chest Clinic, Edgware General Hospital, Edgware Middlesex. (EDGware 3406.) The new Charing Cross Hospital will not now be built in Wembley and this change of plan must be regarded as a prejudice to the hospital services of the Borough. The provision of a new hospital at Northwick Park is, however, still under discussion between the Ministry and the Regional Hospital Board. 2 AMBULANCE SERVICE. A service of ambulances and sitting case cars is maintained by the Middlesex County Council as Loca! Health Authority at:— No. 4 Depot. (WORdsworth 7721) The accident service is obtained by dialling 999. The authority of a medical practitioner is required for service to be given, except in emergency and accident cases. 3 HEALTH SERVICES. Health Services under Part III of the National Health Service Act, 1946, are provided by the County Council and relevant details in so far as they apply to the Borough are included below:— County Medical Officer : A.

Six cases, four adults and tw" children were referred to a Health Centre for treatment more intensi than could be given in the home. The generalisation remains true that infestation is scarcely a Public Health problem in Wembley. The re ponse of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 5. MORTUARY. The new Mortuary, situated at the rear of the Town Hall, came into operation on the 27th July, 1959. Between that date and the end of December 69 bodies were admitted. The Pathologist using the premises has expressed his appreciation of the facilities now provided. An Attendant has been appointed and reciprocal arrangements have been made with Harrow to cover absences due to holidays, sickness etc. 17 CHAPTER III. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. FOOD POISONING. Despite the great amount of scientific and bacteriological investigation which has taken place in recent years, and the practical application of the conclusions reached, there is very little reduction in the incidence of Food Poisoning. The education of kitchen workers now appears to be the field where the greatest chance of improvement lies. Many of the kitchen premises where outbreaks have occurred have been almost ideal in construction and equipment, whilst the lapse has often been one of temporary relaxation in the normally high standard maintained by the staff. The total of cases notified during the year was 16, but only two of these were from outbreaks. It is certain that many sporadic cases occur which are not notified but equally probable that all major incidents are discovered and investigated. Of the five major incidents CI. Weichii was responsible for four producing 115 individual sufferers. It will be seen that many of the larger outbreaks are due to the pre-cooking of meat and its storage in gravy over the week-end or overnight, it seems immaterial whether in a refrigerator or in warm conditions, permitting the multiplication of organisms retained in the mass of food. In such cases the appearance and taste of the food may be quite unaffected and it is only several hours after its ingestion that symptoms develop. These outbreaks are preventable and it appears that our attention should be directed to visits to rooms where meals are being prepared, and the dissemination of advice to kitchen staffs encouraging them to adopt a sound code of practice and never to deviate from this. 2. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF IMMUNISATION. The Department continues to authenticate the International Certificates of Vaccination for travellers who have received inoculations from Wembley practitioners. During the year 1,031 certificates received attention in the Department. 18 3. DISINFECTION. The policy of the Committee in relation to disinfection has been rather an empirical one. The Department has for many years past disinfected on release from quarantine cases of infectious disease where contamination of the environment is likely. The more serious notifiable infectious diseases form the main examples in this group. Disinfection has been accomplished by fumigation of the room in which the patient has been nursed, removal of bedding and bedclothes for steam disinfection, along with a complete and thorough spring cleaning and airing of the sick-room. Whether this procedure results in the death of microbes or no, we feel that it does have a salutary effect in bringing home to the family their personal responsibility for cleaning and airing the environment of the patient on recovery. It is generally conceded that following the most infectious or contagious types of disease it is essential to undertake disinfection of the sick environment or, indeed, destruction of all articles which have come into close contact with the patient. Circumstances where this has been necessary are rare as the diseases involved include such conditions as Smallpox and other virus infections. On occasions disinfection is requested by the relatives of a person who has been sick with, or who has died from a complaint which scientifically is not regarded as infectious, but none the less those in contact do not feel disposed to use the premises or the articles which have been in contact with the patient until such time as they have been disinfected. There is a common phobia following a death from, for instance, Cancer, and in these cases disinfection of the sick-room is performed on repayment. Additionally, there appears to be a substantial export of used clothing by Wembley residents to relatives or friends in underprivileged countries; many of these countries insist on the parcel being accompanied by a certificate of disinfection. The work is undertaken and the certificate is provided on repayment. 19 20 STATISTICAL APPENDIX B. Cases of infectious disease notified in Wards and removals to Hospitals. Disease.

The Council, through its Housing and Estates Committee, has for many years been conscious of the need to define as far as possible those cases which could be seriously considered for rehousing on medical and health grounds. The extent to which recommendations could be received from the medical department was naturally limited, as it was impossible to rehouse all those with medical claims, even if the whole of the available tenancies were each year used for this purpose. The Committee receive from the Health Department quite readily all recommendations where an infectious case of Tuberculosis is living in unsatisfactory conditions along with susceptible children. It also receives cases from the Health Department where the occupant of premises is permanently incapable, on account of physical handicap, of reaching the street from his dwelling or of reaching his dwelling from the street, without substantial assistance. These recommendations are very willingly accepted by the Housing Committee and as little as possible delay is permitted before a suitable tenancy is offered. In 1957, the Health Department were asked to visit and assess all those old persons over the age of 65 who were eligible for rehousing in old persons' dwellings and, amongst other things, to offer points for medical incapacity and for the lack of amenity. This has necessitated a considerable amount of visiting but has resulted in those old persons most in need of rehousing on medical grounds being offered some priority in selection. The Housing Committee have accepted also, in the past, applications from overcrowded families and have recently paid particular attention to those families which have become overcrowded by the process of natural growth of the family. In 1949 there were 558 overcrowded dwellings known to the Health Department and, on account of assistance given by the Housing and Estates Committee in the rehousing of overcrowded families and other factors, this number was reduced to 148 in 1959. 26 2. HOUSING. The Housing Act of 1957 continued as the main statute, under which a considerable amount of work in this sphere was undertaken in the Department during the year. Statistical details are included in the Appendix to this chapter. Legal Proceedings. Proceedings were taken against the owners in respect of repairs required at three premises. Abatement Orders were made under Section 94 of the Public Health Act, 1936, requiring the owners to carry out the work within three months, and the Council were awarded £15 15s. Od. costs. Overcrowding. The number of cases of overcrowding known to the Health Department has shown a steady decrease as the following figures indicate. Year. Number of Cases of overcrowding on Register.

WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough which is provided by the Colne Valley Water Co. (except for a small area in the southern end of the district supplied by the Rickmans worth and Uxbridge Valley Water Co.) remained satisfactory in quality and quantity. The supply is pumped from deep wells ir. the chalk outside the Borough boundaries. All of the samples taker, from piped supplies were reported as satisfactory. No tendency to plumbo solvent action has been detected. All dwelling houses in the Borough are provided with a mains water supply. There is a number of private wells in the Borough all in connection with industrial undertakings, but in no instance is the water from these sources used for drinking. Hardness of Water. The Health Committee have been very concerned about the deleterious effects of hardness in the water supplied to a large part of the Borough and in 1949 conferences were held with the Water Company and visits paid to the Water Company's Works in Watford, to discuss the problem and to ascertain by inspection exactly to what extent the water was being treated prior to distribution in the Company's mains. The Company at that time recognised that they were unable to soften the supply as much as they would like to do, although they pleaded that they were one of the few water undertakings in the country who undertook any treatment of the supply with the intention of reducing hardness. The Company informed the Council that certain works were required in their Clay Lane Pumping Station, Watford, and that when these improvements were completed there would be a substantial reduction in the hardness of the water supplied. The accompanying Table indicates that for the first whole year, 1959 showed a substantial reduction in the degree of hardness present in the water distributed to premises in the town. 28 Average "total hardness" per month of samples (in parts per million) of water taken by the Colne Valley Water Company in Wembley.

IMPURITIES OF FOOD. There have been during the year a considerable number of cases where residents have complained to the Department that food and food products purchased have been unsatisfactory. On occasions the complaint has been that the food has become unfit for human consumption either by prolonged storage or by deficiencies in preparation. Frequently however, also, of recent date, complaints have been brought to our notice of foreign bodies contained within the substance of food stuffs and dirty containers into which the food (usually liquid) has been placed It is always difficult to decide precisely in these cases what action will be most successful and general policy questions considered by the Committee in relation to such cases have, as far as possible, been made on logical and distinct lines, but it is none the less recognised that each individual case must be judged on its merits at the time and no general decision can be laid down covering all circumstances. The Department investigate fully all complaints and from time to time it is somewhat frustrating to find that after full investigation, when the Council wish to proceed against the purveyor of food, the original complainant decides that he or she is not disposed to give evidence, in which circumstances it is impossible to proceed with the case. This work would seem to be a duplication as the Public Control Department of the County Council undertake investigations in relation to the purity of food and the sampling of food, but one feels the work within the Health Department is none the less most important. 5. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN CONNECTION WITH FOOD. Legal proceedings in connection with food were taken on five occasions during the year. One firm was fined for selling a loaf 29 of bread containing a nail. A dairy company was fined on two occasions—once for selling milk in a dirty bottle and once for selling a bottle of milk containing foreign matter (wire mesh). Another firm was fined on two occasions for selling milk in dirty bottles. 6. INDUSTRIAL EFFLUVIA. Complaints of industrial odour continue to be received and in previous reports the elimination of industrial odour has been discussed. One wonders how these agents for the elimination of smell actually operate either indoors or outdoors. There is a possibility that the deodorant material oxidises or causes some chemical change to take place in the particles (the aerosol) producing the smell, which results in a chemical compound having a different odour or having little cdour at all. This might possibly occur indoors but almost certainly is impossible in the case of an odour pervading a substantial area outside. There is a possibility that the material used to obliterate the offensive odour in fact merely operates by masking the offensive odour with one more acceptable to the human sense. One hesitates to suggest that the deodoiants can be effective by paralysing temporarily or semi-permanently the sensory nerve endings of smell in the nasopharynx. One feels this is almost an impossibility outdoors and would be extremely hazardous and fraught with considerable risk if used inside a particular room. The obviously hygienic and logical way to obliterate complaint of odour, is to avoid producing the situation where odoriferous particles become suspended in the atmosphere, either indoors or out. This involves strict cleanliness indoors and the treatment of fumes before discharge from industrial premises. 7. INSTRUMENTS. The increasing desire and need for quantitive evaluation rather than subjective impression, has led us to seek instruments which can record quite impartially the degree of disturbance actually created in areas where complaint is received. The need for these instruments has become intensified more recently and in the Department we experimented with the production of a transparency of different degrees of opacity transmitting light to the extent of 20%, 40%, 60%, corresponding to the degrees of Ringelrnann's Scale. The Ringelmann Scale is the standard selected in the Clean Air Act but it is realised that the scale is not absolute and is a very difficult one indeed to use. The experimental transparency produced in the Health Department was not sufficiently reliable for field use 30 and we did not persevere with the idea. However, a smoke-scope was purchased which adopts the same ideas and consists of a small telescope with a disc which occludes 40 per cent. of the light in part of the field leaving the rest of the field clear for a direct view of smoke issuing from the chimney under observation. This probably would not be reliable in Court but it is very useful to demonstrate to the factory owners and to the stokers the density of the smoke emitted. Noise intensity was previously assessed by the Inspector on a subjective basis and quite naturally this was invariably called into question by the complainant. We have purchased recently an apparatus which records the intensity of noise in decibels, and whilst we are not able to analyse at each pitch, none the less it is possible to come to an objective conclusion of the total disturbance. In the event of remedial works being undertaken by the offenders it is possible at a subsequent date to ascertain if there has been no change or if there has been a reduction in the total energy content of the noise. More recently still we have brought into use a light meter for the measurement of the luminosity of any particular working surface or workroom. This will be of value in influencing factory and office owner- to improve lighting conditions in their premises. There are many other instruments which we would like to use in the Department but cost, has, up to the moment, precluded any further extension. 8. REGISTRATION OF HAWKERS. Hawkers who ply their trade from mobile vehicles within the boundaries of the Borough, require to be registered with the Council under a local Act. This registration has been in force for many years and at the present moment the relevant statute is the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, Section 11. It is important to ensure that the motor vehicles and carts from which food products are sold in the Borough, are reasonably equipped and adequately maintained to avoid risk of complaint and risk of food poisoning. Established traders are excused registration as any individual who trades from shop premises is saved the necessity of registration. Shortly after the War, when the delivery of purchases had not yet become re-established, many applications were received for the sale of such commodities as greengrocery and fish, but now that more static firms are able to offer delivery, the demand for such services is 31 decreasing, and our experience is that the number of vans presented for registration is reduced and generally speaking they. are ideally suited for the purpose. The same applies to hawkers of refreshments. A few years ago many registrations were received and some difficulty was experienced in controlling the sale of refreshments at events in the town, and the sale of fried fish from mobile stalls during the evening. Social changes once again appear to have eliminated the necessity for this type of service and consequently our difficulties have been reduced. 9. "HORSE OF THE YEAR SHOW." During the latter part of the year, the Stadium authorities promoted the "Horse of the Year Show" for the first time in Wembley. This internationally famous event presented many problems to the Health Department, because of the sudden influx of some 150 “lived-in" caravans, 80 "lived-in " horse boxes, and the stabling of 580 horses. Temporary arrangements were made for the reception of waste water and chemical closet contents into the sewerage system, and daily refuse collection and disposal was organised. The removal of soiled bedding and manure from the horse boxes was undertaken daily by a contractor engaged by the "Horse of the Year" Committee, and a number of stand-pipes were erected by the Colne Valley Water Co. along Lakeside Way, to provide a water supply for the temporary occupants. The Public Health Inspectors visited daily in order to check and remedy any possible nuisances, and advise those responsible. In all, these arrangements worked reasonably well, but there was room for improvement, and at the conclusion a communication was sent to the Stadium authorities setting out our observations and requesting that adequate notice be given in future years, so as to afford time for consultation well in advance of the commencement of the event. 10. SWIMMING POOLS. The two outdoor Swimming Pools have continued to be a source of enjoyment and healthy recreation. "Breakpoint" chlorination or superchlonnation which was installed just prior to the 1951 season has made it possible to maintain a sparkling clear water, together with a .minimum risk of infection. 32 Attendances at the Pools during the year were:— Kingsbury 206,807 Vale Farm, Wembley 151,437 11. RODENT CONTROL. The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three "Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 620 premises were satisfactorily treated by the Council and 14 premises were known to have been treated privately. 12. PUBLIC CLEANSING. The Director of Public Cleansing has kindly supplied the following information:— Refuse Collection. House and Trade refuse is collected weekly, with the exception that refuse from certain blocks of flats is collected twice weekly. The amount of refuse collected during the year was 28,718 tons. The separate collection of waste paper from business premises free of charge has been maintained. The amount collected from this source during the year was 767 tons. Refuse Disposal. Refuse is disposed of by a Separation and Incineration Plant which has handled 29,878 tons. Salvage materials amounting to 3,401 tons were sold for £15,571. Street Cleansing. The system of street sweeping by the use of pedestrian controlled electric trucks, each with an operator and four street orderlies, continues to give a frequency of sweeping of at least once every seven days. Public Conveniences. The increase in use of the free washing facilities at the two staffed Conveniences in the Borough has been maintained during the year. 33 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

During the year your Medical Officers acted professionally for the Council in performing 49 clinical examinations of actual or prospective staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This helps in securing a medically sound personnel for all the activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual incidence of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficiency difficult without such a service. So far as the Inspectorate is concerned, there was again depletion for a large part of the year owing to illness. I refer with deep regret to the premature resignation of Mr. R. M. Turner, from the post of Chief Public Health Inspector, which occurred in December of this year. The Department and the Council lost, by his resignation, the services of a deeply competent and sincerely enthusiastic officer. This short note is made merely to act as a record, because Mr. Turner's departure was noted by a widely attended meeting of his colleagues and by a resolution of the Health Committee and the Council sincerely thanking him for the services which he undoubtedly gave to the Borough. Great credit is due to the remaining staff for their earnest endeavours to cope with the difficult situation in which the Department was placed. In conclusion, I would express my thanks and appreciation to all members of the Council, especially those who serve on the Health Committee, and particularly the Chairman, for the admirable way in which they have directed the policy of the Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health 51 Hendon Printing Works Limited 66. East Road.
