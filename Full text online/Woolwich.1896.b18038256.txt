Town Hall, Woolwich, 9th March, 1897. To The Chairman and Members of the Woolwich Local Board of Health. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report upon the sanitary condition of Woolwich during the year 1896. Mortality There have been 879 deaths during the year: of this Stat sties number 392 occurred in the Dockyard Registration SubDistrict, and 487 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The gross death-rate for the year, estimated upon a population of 41,338, is 20.9 per thousand. Of these deaths, 192 took place in various medical institutions (Table VII.) outside the district; in the appended statistical tallies they have, however, been allotted to their proper registration sub-districts, and calculated as ii taking place within the sanitary area of Woolwich. Nineteen deaths, occurring within the district, were of Persons not rightly belonging to Woolwich; if these be deducted from the total deaths, the correct number of deaths occurring in Woolwich during the twelve months ending the 31st December, 1896, will be obtained, viz., 860. Death Rate The correoted death-rate is, therefore, 20.4 per thousand. 2 The following table shows the corrected death rate yearly, since the appointment of a Medical Officer of Health for the district on the 29th October, 1889:— 1890 20.5 1891 21.6 1892 19.5 1893 19.7 1894 18.2 1895 17.4 1896 20.4 The death rate for 1896 is thus seen to be the highest for the last four years. This is solely due to the great prevalence of Measles in the early part of the year, and the increased mortality resulting therefrom. The general health of the community compares favourably with former years. I have appended Tables, Nos. IX. and X., which show comparatively the position taken by Woolwich in this respeot to other large towns and to the various Metropolitan Sanitary Districts. Of the total deaths 387 were of children under 5 years, and 473 of persons above that age: of the 387 children, 224 were infants under one year of age. The infantile mortality is, therefore, 174 per 1,000 births:— Total Deaths. Deaths under one year. Deaths between the ages of one and five years. 1890 838 215 141 1891 885 222 117 1892 806 198 95 1893 828 210 105 1894 755 177 113 1895 748 209 82 1896 860 224 163 In Table V. will be found a comparison of the deaths occurring in 3 the Sanitary District of Woolwich during the years 1891, 1895 and 1896, distinguishing those under 5 years of age and those over 5 years of age. Zymotic The deaths from all causes during the year included 72 Death Rate. from Measles, 9 from Scarlet Fever, 35 from Diarrhoea, 31 from Diphtheria, 21 from Whooping Cough, 2 from Typhoid Fever, 1 from Continued Fever, and 8 from Influenza; in all 179 deaths from diseases classified by the Registrar General as Specific Febrile or Zymotic. This is equivalent to a Zymotic death rate of 4.2 per thousand. The deaths from Measles, Diarrhœa, Whooping Cough and Diphtheria are in excess of those from the same causes last year, when they were respectively, 6, 24, 3 and 14; but those from Scarlet Fever, Typhoid Fever and Influenza have fallen from 11, 9 and 12 respectively. The Zymotic death rate for the past six years is as follows:— 1891 2.8 1892 2.4 1893 2.6 1894 2.6 1895 1.8 1896 4.2 Phthisis In Table I., Class IV., 124 deaths are recorded as Mortality, &c. arising from some form of tubercular disease, of which number 53 occurred in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District, and 71 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The great difference between these numbers is occasioned not by the deaths from Tabes Mesenterica, Tubercular Meningitis and Hydrocephalus, but to deaths from Phthisis, which were 37 in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District and 50 in the Arsenal. Thirty-four of the total deaths' were of children under 5 years of age, and 90 at ages from 5 and upwards. 4 The deaths registered during the past six years as arising from Tubercular causes were as follows:— 1891 139 1892 112 1893 121 1894 126 1895 119 1896 124 I have in previous reports drawn marked attention to the mortality from Tubercular diseases in the district, and indicated its grave importance ; and I now append a spot map which shows graphically the distribution of the disease throughout the district. As I have before remarked, there is no doubt that in most, if not all, of the older houses of the district, there is no provision to prevent dampness: and especially is this the case with the houses in North Woolwich; and to this defect I attribute much of the evil. The Sanitary Authority must continue to insist upon all proper means being adopted to remedy this, fraught as it obviously is with the most serious injury to health. Sex Mortality. Of the total deaths in the Arsenal Registration Sub- District, there were 264 males and 223 females; in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District 211 males and 181 females; or, in other words, of the 879 total deaths in the whole district 475 were of males and 404 of females; 174 deaths were of persons over 60 years of age. Births and Births Rate The number of births registered during the year was 1,283. Of these 18 were recorded as illegitimate. The birth rate is, therefore, 30.5 per thousand, that for the Dockyard being 27.8 per thousand, and for 'the Arsenal 32.9. For the past six years the birth rate has been as follows:— 5 1891 32.7 1892 29.9 1893 31.3 1894 30.5 1895 30.9 1896 30.5 Marriages There have been 602 marriages registered during the year; in the first quarter 118, in the second 133, in the third 146, and in the fourth 205. Inquests and Suicides. There have been 72 inquests during the year. There have been 3 Suicides as follows:—Hanging 1, Drowning 1, and Suicide on Railway 1. Mortuary. Fifty-two bodies were received into the Mortuary, of which 32 were of persons resident in the district, and 20 non-resident. Of these 316 cases, l75 were removed to Hospital, as follows:— Infectious Diseases. During the year 316 cases of infectius disease have been notified as follows:- Arsenal Sub-District. Dockya d Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 97 47 144 Diphtheria 55 44 99 Erysipelas 20 25 45 Typhoid 10 11 21 Small Pox 1 - 1 Puerperal Fever - 1 1 Typhus - - - Continued - 3 3 Membranous Croup 1 1 2 Total 184 132 316 6 Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 74 35 109 Diphtheria 28 23 51 Typhoid Fever 6 8 14 Small Pox 1 - 1 Total 109 66 175 In other words, the following cases were treated at home:— Arsenal Sub-District. Dookyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 23 12 35 Diphtheria 27 21 48 Erysipelas 20 25 45 Typhoid Fever 4 3 7 Puerperal Fever - 3 3 Continued Fever - 1 1 Membranous Croup 1 1 2 Total 75 66 141 I note with satisfaction the greatly increased tendency for cases of infectious disease to be sent to Hospital. The privilege o/* ' to the inhabitants of free admission to the Hospitals of the Mei i Asylums Board is a great boon, and one which it is somewh prising is not taken advantage of to its fullest extent; but doub s the number of admissions would have been greater this year if accommodation at the Hospitals had been available. Since the opening of the Brook Hospital at Shooter's Hill, in June, we have found it possible to obtain a greater proportion of removals to Hospital than formerly. The total amount of Infectious Disease present in Woolwich during the year has been less than in 1895, though there has been a larger amount of Diphtheria. The number of cases of Scarlet Fever, how-ever has steadily declined since 1892. The following table will show the prevalence of the principal Zymotic diseases during the past six years:— 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 Scarlet Fever 80 338 259 215 187 144 Diphtheria 8 17 24 49 67 99 Typhoid Fever 11 18 25, 14 50 21 Small Pox - 2 61 15 1 1 7 The most careful investigation has been made with the view of determining the cause of the increased prevalence of Diphtheria, but with no satisfactory result. Crops of oases occurred in the neighbourhood of three schools, viz.:—Eglinton Street and Union Street Board Schools and St. Thomas's Church School. In no single instance could any possibility of infection at school be found. The sanitary arrangements in all the houses attacked were good, but in three or four cases over-crowding was found; notices have, however, since been served and the conditions remedied. In no instance could the disease be traced to the milk supply. I append a map showing the distribution of the disease. On reference to the following returns of the Metropolitan Asylums Board we get the notifications of infectious disease, received by that Board for the corresponding six years from the whole of London:— 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 Scarlet Fever 11398 27095 36901 10655 19757 25647 Diphtheria 5907 7781 13026 18440 10772 13362 Typhoid Fever 3372 2465 3663 3360 3506 3190 Small Pox 114 423 2813 1192 979 225 Great attention has of late years been given to the increased incidence of Diphtheria in London, and many causes for the same have been assigned, but none have been adopted as affording a satisfactory solution of the problem. Last year I made the suggestion that facilities should be afforded to Medical Officers of Health for obtaining a bacteriological examination of the throat in cases of sore throat to determine whether the affection was diphtheritic or not. This would appear the more desirable from the fact of the necessity for the early treatment of such cases with anti-toxic serum with the view of obtaining the best result. One case of Small Pox was notified during the year. The patient was a steward on a P. and 0. Steamship, and had attended a passenger supposed to be suffering from Chicken Pox. He was promptly removed to Hospital, and no fresh cases arose. 8 The notification of Infectious Diseases still continues to work well and without friction. Disinfection. During the year 5,129 articles of clothing, bedding, etc., have been disinfected (Table XVI.) Sickness Returns. I append a table giving the sickness returns from various sources during the year (Table XIX.) House to House During the year the Inspectors have visited 4,482 Inspection. houses, and made 3,327 re-inspections, these inspections necessitating the issuing of 2,021 notices. The following figures shew the number of inspections made since the appointment of a Clerk, compared with the number made during the same period (June to December) in 1895:— Inspector Mackie (7 months). Inspector Woolley (7 months). 1895 1896 1895 1896 860 1616 940 1274* Common There are 38 common lodging houses in the district. Lodging Houses. The control of these houses is now under the London County Council. They are generally well conducted, and the proprietors continue to evince a desire to co-operate in every way with the Sanitary Officials. slaughter There are 7 licensed slaughter-houses in the district Houses. and the licensees generally observe all the regulations in force by the London County Council. I hope, in the interests of the trade, as well as of the public, that the time is not far distant whets these will all be done away with, and that Woolwich will have a public Abattoir under the control of its Local Authority, for in such case not only will an undesirable adjunct to the business premises be removed, but the opportunity will be given for a more regular and systematic inspection of the meat supply of the district. *Also 60 additional samples taken under the Food and Drugs Act. 9 Bakehouses. These have, during the year, been systematically visited, and compliance with the regulations enforced. There are 42 bakehouses in the district; structurally many of them are most defeotive, but legally the greatest difficulties exist for abolishing them. It is satisfactory to note that no new bakehouse from 1st January, 1896, can be allowed to be below ground, and during the year three applications have been refused for the re-opening of underground bakehouses. Rag and Bone Shops. These have been regularly visited, and have called for no special action on the part of the officials. Cow Sheds, Milk Shops, &c. There are 3 licensed cowsheds in the district; these, together with the milk shops, etc., have been subjected to constant supervision. The Market. The market has been systematically visited both by night and day. Occasionally only has it been found necessary to seize food as unfit for human consumption; the meat is frequently, however, of poor qualitv. Dust Collection. The pail system continues to work most satisfactorily. The dust is removed weekly- from every house in the district, and from some of the streets in the poorer parts of the town twice or thrice weekly. The destructor provided by the Board works very satisfactorily both by night and day. I append in Table XXVII. an interesting financial statement prepared by Mr. H. 0. Thomas, the Surveyor to the Board, relative to its use, which shows a considerable saving financially to the district. Housing of the Working Classes Act. The number of houses dealt with under this Act has necessarily not been so large as in previous years. Certificates were, however, given in reference to 3 houses, and in each case the necessary work was done without a closing order being applied for. 10 Underground Rooms. The use of underground rooms as dwelling room, has been under serious consideration so far as Woolwich is concerned. The present stringent regulations on this subject will, I think, have the effect of abolishing the use of all these places. House let in Lodgings. The Bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings, having received the approval of the Local Government Board, have been put into force. There are now 59 houses legistered under these bye-laws. (Table XXV.) The Baths continue to be used satisfactorily, no less than 133,851 males and 16,766 females having made use of them during the year, making a total of 150,617 bathers for 1896, an increase of nearly 5,000 on the figures for last year. During the season 15 Board Schools attended the Baths for instruction in swimming, 10 boys' and 5 girls' Schools, averaging 600 children per week, or a total of 10,510 school children for the year. Sanitary and other Improvdnents. The most noteworthy events which have happened during the year, and which have a beneficial influence upon the health and progress of the district, are:— 1. An underground urinal in Beresford Square is now in course of construction. 2. Plans have been prepared for the new mortuary, which will probably be erected during the ensuing year. 3. The Board have decided to pave the main road from Charlton to Plumstead with granite sets. 4. A considerable number of houses have been rebuilt in Powis Street, Hare Street, Bed Lion Street, etc., during the year. 5. A constant supply of water has been obtained by the sinking of a well at the Public Baths, and 12 new private baths have also been fixed. 11 6. The approval of the London County Council has been given to the North Woolwich Drainage Scheme. 7. The opening of The Brook Hospital at Shooters Hill for the admission of Fever Cases. 8. The authorised increase of the number of samples taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 200 per annum being now analysed instead of 100 as formerly. 9. The appointment of a Clerk in the Sanitary Department. 10. The registration of 59 houses let in lodgings under the Board's Bye-laws. 11. A new and complete system of drainage is being laid in the Royal Artillery Barracks to supersede the brick sewers which were constructed a hundred years ago. 1 have in conclusion to acknowledge my indebtedness to the Committee for their continued support and to the Sanitary Inspectors and the Clerk in the Sanitary Department for their loyal co-operation and the conscientious discharge of their respective duties.
