PURSUANT to the 115th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, we hereby certify that we have carefully examined and Audited the respective Accounts of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint James and Saint John, Clerkenwell, for the year ending Lady-day, 1878, and that we find, them to be true and correct in all particulars, and we hereby sign the same in token thereof.

To the Vestry of the Parish of Saint James and Saint John. Clerkenwell. Gentlemen,—We the undersigned Auditors of Accounts for the Parish of Saint James and Saint John, Clerkenwell, having carefully examined and completed our Audit for the year ending March 25th, 1878, have much pleasure in again expressing our satisfaction at the very excellent manner and great accuracy in which the accounts have been kept, and we present our mutual thanks to Mr. Paget and his Son for their kind and prompt attention to us during our Audit by giving us every information and explanation necessary on all matters relative to the Accounts, which rendered everything most clear and satisfactory, and through which we easily accomplished our duties. Dated this 5th day of July, 1878. We are, Gentlemen, yours very respectfully, (SIGNED) JOHN B. LEWIS, HENRY KNOTT, ROBERT CHIPPERFIELD; EDWARD AMBROSE HILL, Auditors. To the Vestry of Saint James and Saint John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen,—In presenting the Report of the Annual Audit for the year ending Lady-day, 1878, I have felt it incumbent upon me to take a course which is probably unprecedented, viz.—to abstain from signing the Report of my colleagues. But to avoid misapprehension, I may at once state, that I desire to record my utmost satisfaction with the manner in which the Accounts were presented to us, and my appreciation of the courtesy shown us by Mr. Paget, the Vestry Clerk, and Mr. R. E. Paget, and also their readiness to afford us the fullest information. Upon these matters we are unanimous, but, in the discharge of what I conceive to be my duty, I must enter my protest against the sum of £21 payment of a Testimonial to Mr. Goad, ex-Churchwarden, as illegal expenditure of the Rates, with no justification but precedent. With reference also to the amount expended in Refreshments and Dinners by the Assessment and other Committees, I am strongly of opinion that too little attention has been given to judicious expenditure, and, that a stated allowance for services rendered would be preferable to the present system, for I find on an analysis of the expenditure for Dinners (including the Auditors) that it ranges from 5/- to 13/- per head. I may frankly say in conclusion that having accepted the position of Auditor, my sole aim has been to faithfully discharge the duties appertaining thereto. I am, Gentlemen, yours respectfully, J. C. PATRICK. SUMMARY STATEMENT OF CONTRACTS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF GENERAL WORKS AND SUPPLY OF MATERIALS. Date. Name of Contractor. Nature of Work to be performed and Materials supplied. Period.

COX, Surveyor. Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, October 15th, 1878. 17 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 187 7. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, The number of deaths arising from all causes in Clerkenwell, during the year 1877, was 1,385. The annual average of the last ten years was 1,456, so that the deaths were 71 below the average. The deaths in 1876 having been 1,342, those in 1877 were 43 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— deaths. births. 1868 1,644 2,478 1869 1,512 2,410 1870 1,473 2,415 1871 1,417 2,274 1872 1,323 2,353 1873 1,513 2,664 1874 1,417 2,565 1875 1,539 2,505 1876 1,342 2,559 1877 1,385 2,522 The births were 48 more than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 452 759 307 Amwell 352 660 308 Pentonville 268 488 220 Goswell 313 615 302 18 In each year a number of the deaths of the parishioners takes place in general and special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums, situated in other parishes. The estimated number of these for 1877 is 99. The number of births having been 2,522, and of deaths 1,385, the excess, or the natural excess of population, is 1,137. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1877 was 284; being an increase of 74 in regard to that of the preceding year. The numbers and causes of the deaths taking place from these principal zymotic diseases during the last 10 years are exhibited in the subjoined table.— SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLET FEVER. HOOPING COUGH. Typhus. DIARRHœA. TOTAL. 1868 4 58 106 69 112 45 394 1869 0 28 116 81 74 44 343 1870 6 63 122 19 70 40 320 1871 60 23 33 62 68 33 279 1872 15 35 20 105 76 23 274 1873 0 48 13 49 29 95 234 1874 2 63 71 38 31 55 260 1875 2 36 76 82 24 58 278 1876 2 48 34 41 12 73 210 1877 15 73 82 36 25 53 284 19 The average number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ton years was 287, so that the number for 1877 is 3 below the average. The number of deaths arising from all diseases in infants under 1 year of age was 399; 13 more than in the precedingyear. 210 deaths occurred at and above 60; 18 less than in tinlast year. 113 iuquest-deaths were registered in the year, being the same number as in the preceding year. 73 deaths occurred in the Workhouse: 47 of males, 26 of females. The numbers last year were 93, 53, and 40 respectively. 15 deaths took place in the House of Correction; 4 in the House of Detention. 49 deaths arose from violence; 11 more than in the previous year. Hence the mortality of the year has been below the average, but not so much so as in the preceding year. The mortality amounted to 21 per 1,000. If the persons dying in Hospitals, &c., be added, the mortality would amount to 22 per 1,000. In 20 large English towns the mortality per 1,000 in 1877 was:—London, 21.9; Brighton, 18.7; Portsmouth, 17.4; Norwich, 21; Plymouth, 21.7; Bristol, 21.8; Wolverhampton, 24.2; Birmingham, 24.2; Leicester, 21.5; Nottingham, 22.9; Liverpool, 26.5; Manchester, 27.4; Salford, 25.1; Oldham, 24.2; Bradford, 21.9; Leeds, 22.3; Sheffield, 21.9; Hull, 21.7; Sunderland, 22.6; Newcastle-on-Tyne, 22.4. The mortality in all London was 21.9; that of the West districts, 19.1; of the North districts, 21.8; of the Central districts, 24.1; of the East districts, 24.4; and of the South districts, 21.3. 20 In the estimation of the mortality of the year everything necessarily depends upon the correct determination of the population. When the last Census was taken, in 1871, it was found that a diminution of the population in the parish had occurred to the extent of 301; but since that time, especially during the last few years, there has been so much pulling down and rebuilding, that the exact determination of the population becomes difficult. Considering, however, that the number of births has not materially altered, I think we may fairly assume that the number of inhabitants has not to any considerable extent varied. The density of persons to the acre also greatly influences the mortality of a parish, the Central districts (of which Clerkenwell is one) being at a disadvantage in this respect. In the West districts there are 52 persons to the acre; in the North, 56; in the Central, 150; in the East, 107; and in the South, 21. But these numbers are varying considerably year by year. On examining the table of deaths from zymotic (i.e., contagious and infectious) diseases, it is seen that the deaths from Small Pox occurring in the parish had increased; those from Measles also; those from Scarlet Fever also; those from Hooping Cough declined; those from Typhus increased; while those from Diarrhoea diminished. Hence, altogether, the deaths from these diseases, although below the average of the last 10 years, were more numerous than in the preceding year. The epidemic of Small Pox, which began in the autumn of 1866, continued during the year to which this Report refers. 105 cases are known to have existed in the parish, 39 in the two lower, or southern wards, and 66 in the three upper, or northern wards. But as there is no law to compel the communication of the occurrence of cases to the Vestry, no doubt there have been other cafes, mostly in private practice, which have not been 21 reported. Many of these cases—about 77—were removed to the Asylums Hospital by the Union medical officers. I need not repeat what has been so often stated in regard to the importance of vaccination and re-vaccination. The law enforces infantile vaccination, but as the families of the poorer class so frequently change their residences a number of infants escape the supervision of the vaccination officers by removing out of their districts, and so remain unvaccinated. Re-vaccination is comparatively very little attended to, yet its preventive efficacy may be truly said to be absolute. This may be well illustrated by reference to a report of Dr. Collie, of the Metropolitan Asylum District Board, wherein it is stated that during five months that the Small Pox was treated, 100 persons were engaged in attendance upon the sick; all these persons, with two exceptions, were re-vaccinated, and they all, with the exceptions referred to, although exposed to the infection in its most concentrated form, escaped the disease. The exceptions referred to were a kitchenmaid and a stoker. But the appointment of these persons had not been reported to the medical superintendent, and, as a consequence, they were not re-vaccinated, and both contracted Small Pox. The same result has occurred in the experience of later years on a much larger scale. No age is exempt from Small Pox, where proper protection has not been obtained, for one person died of it at 80. The cases occurring in this parish were almost invariably single, and scattered. It will be noticed that the number of cases occurring in the upper, or least crowded wards, was nearly double that in the lower, or most densely populated wards; and I cannot avoid attributing this to the proximity of the former wards to that portion of Islington Parish in which the disease prevailed to an enormous extent. The number of cases of Small Pox occurring in Clerkenwell was very nearly the same as that in the Holborn district— rather less. I have no returns of the St. Luke's parish, but if the above suggestion is correct, 22 the cases will be found much less numerous in that parish. In all London the deaths were 2,544; a large number, but much less than that in 1871, when the deaths amounted to 7,876. The deaths from Scarlet Fever were also in excess in the year. This is a most troublesome disease to contend with, for many of the cases are so extremely slight that the patients are well enough, and allowed to mix freely with other children, and so spread the disease, and the next affected may suffer severely and succumb to the malady. Overcrowding, and the occupation of single rooms by families, are also potent causes of the diffusion of this disease, and these evils certainly exist to a considerable extent in this as in other parishes; although, when discovered, the former is always remedied. Very frequently two or three children in a family may be affected with the mild form of this disease, remaining at home, without medical attendance, the other members of the family going to school, and so carrying the infection in their clothes, until the disease becomes extensively diffused. Four of the cases included under Scarlet Fever were registered as arising from Diphtheria. Of the 25 deaths from Fever, 1 was registered as arising from Typhus, 21 from Typhoid or Enteric Fever, and 3 from common continued Fever. The same remarks apply to Measles and Hooping Cough, in regard to the spread of which no care whatever is taken. Yet the mortality from these diseases is very great. Thus, in 1877, when there were 2,544 deaths from Small Pox in the metropolis, there were 2,317 from Measles, and 1,780 from Hooping Cough. And in 1873, when there were only 115 deaths from Small Pox, there were 2,195 from Measles, and 2,689 from Hooping Cough —in all, 4,884 ! Small Pox epidemics break out at intervals, as it seems probable to me, when a certain proportion of unvaccinated persons is attained, and when another proportion of persons has reached 23 the age at which the preventive efficacy of primary vaccination has ceased, and re-vaccination has not been performed. Then the disease, which is always present, and readily diffused by the great intermingling of persons, finds, so to speak, a ready soil in which to flourish. When the epidemic is over, the most susceptible of the unprotected persons have suffered, many have died, and there is no soil for a few years in which the germs of the disease can be developed. Age also exerts considerable influence upon the epidemic occurrence, both of the Small Pox and other infectious diseases, which attack especially children and young persons, the Small Pox, however, including many adult persons among its victims. When an epidemic has occurred, and affected those susceptible, a few years must elapse before there is a sufficient number of subjects of suitable age to allow of the general and extensive spread of the disease required to form the epidemic. Slaughter-houses.—These were, as usual, inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself during the year. They were 20, kept by the same number of butchers. Last year the numbers were the same. They were mostly clean and in good order. Cow-houses.—These were also inspected during the year. They were 26, kept by the same number of cowkeepers, the number of cows being 277. In 1876 the numbers were 27, 27, and 352. The condition of the cow-houses is very variable, some being well-constructed, and in excellent order, while a few are very closely confined, low, and really unsuitable for the purpose. In consequence of a general complaint, emanating from the Metropolitan Board of Works, that the cattle disease was much fostered and propagated by the bad arrangement of the cowhouses in' the metropolis, the Vestry directed me to make a "Special Report" on their condition. This was done, and the Report printed and circulated among the Vestry; and it was determined to oppose the licenses of some of them at the 24 ber Sessions. The dimensions of the cow-houses were also taken in relation to the number of cows, so that some rule might be laid down and acted upon in regard to a certain cubic space per cow. The defects of the faulty cow-houses consisted mainly in their being too closely imbedded among inhabited houses, there being no yards, and the dung-pits being within the cowhouses, thereby heating and rendering foul the air within, and even tending to contaminate the milk. The justices suspended the licenses of these, and some others, until certain improvements were effected; but they declined to suspend the licenses of the worst, or to lay down a rule as to cubic space, inasmuch as the premises were incapable of enlargement, and the businesses had been carried on in them for many years, and no positive and direct injury had been shown to arise from their use. Bakehouses.—The bakehouses were also inspected. They were 62, kept by 60 bakers. Last year the numbers were 60 and 57. Some of these are excellently constructed, situated above ground (as all ought to be), and in good order; while others, as I have so often pointed out, are below ground, illsituated. low. close, without proper light and ventilation, and ought to be shut up, with due regard to the health of the workmen. But as this cannot be done, we are compelled to rest satisfied with enforcing the terms of the Act. Mortuary.—A notable event in the year was the completion of the Mortuary. This building, which has been erected at considerable expense, contains a Coroner's Court, a waitingroom, two rooms for the reception of the dead—one for infectious, the other for non-infectious cases—a post-mortem room, with the necessary offices; the whole being well constructed, very ornamental, the fittings being of the most modern and approved kind. Appended to it is the disinfecting oven. In an adjoining house lives the mortuary-keeper, to whom great 25 credit is due for the well-managed and clean condition in which the premises are kept. Disinfectants are abundantly supplied to arrest the decomposition of the corpses during the time they are kept there, and to render the inspection by the juries of those kept under the Coroner's orders, which is essential, as little painful and disagreeable as possible. The Mortuary was opened with some ceremony on April 24th; and notice was sent to all the medical men of the parish that it was at their disposal to send corpses when there was not proper room for them in the dwellings, and to apply to the Vestry in cases where it might be required to put the law into force for their removal where this was opposed. Since the opening of the Mortuary, to the end of the year, 200 bodies were removed there: G6 of these were bodies related to inquest cases; 50 came from the Workhouse ; and 84 others were removed there from want of proper space for retention at the houses of the deceased. 25 post-mortems were made during the above period. Hence the Mortuary has already been of immense service, especially to the poorer portion of the population of this denselycrowded parish; for the number of removals has been nearly one-sixth of the total number of deaths taking place in the parish during the year. It is to be hoped that, as the Mortuary becomes better known and appreciated, this number will be still larger. I think the Vestry and the parishioners have great reason to be proud of their Mortuary, which is certainly second to none in the metropolis. Artizans' Dwellings Improvement Act. — In the spring of the year one " area" condemned under this Act, in my "Official Representation" made in 1875, was taken in hand by the Metropolitan Board of Works, viz., that relating to Pear 26 Tree Court, and a Scheme prepared, which was confirmed by the Secretary of State, and subsequently received the sanction of Parliament. No active proceedings have yet been taken in regard to the demolition of the houses, and their replacement by new ones. Several of our worst courts and alleys, most of which were included in my "Representation," have been pulled down within the last few years, viz., Caroline Court, Goswell Road; Lamb Court and Lamb Square, Bitt Alley, Fryingpan Alley, Rose Alley, Broad Court (for the most part), Eagle Place, Albert Place, and Ledbury Place, under the New Streets Act, and to make room for the new "Compton Buildings," also for the Board Schools and other new buildings. Altogether about 700 or 800 poor persons have been displaced by those "improvements." At the same time, the new Farringdon Road Buildings have been constructed, containing about 1,200 inhabitants, and the Compton Buildings, containing about 1,700; so that the accommodation provided by the new buildings would exceed that destroyed by the removal. But there can be no question that the inhabitants of the courts, &c., have not entered the new buildings, but have taken refuge in some of the remaining courts, such as Bishop's Com-t, &c.; but a large number have, I believe, gone to Holborn and St. Luke's. And it must be remembered that for some years past houses which used to be occupied by a single family are now let out in tenements, a family frequently occupying one or two rooms only. Undoubtedly this breaking up of the old haunts and slums in which many of these people lived, and the distribution of the latter among a better class, will ultimately be a boon to them and their rising families; for the Vestry, and the Sanitary Committee especially, will well remember the endless trouble, and the very numerous inspections of those courts, especially those in Turnmill Street: where no closet could havo a pan, closet-fittings, traps, and metal-pipes of all kinds were immediately stolen and sold; 27 an open drain was all that would stand; the water-butt lids, and even the butts themselves, as well as the boards of palings and hoardings, were used as firewood; dogs, fowls, and donkeys all formed part of the inhabitants; no chimneys were ever swept, so that the rooms were quite black, and the occupants were smoked, and acquired such peculiar complexions, that I always thought they were really "smoked" as any haddock. The vegetables were stored on each side of the drain, along which the slops and excrement flowed, there being no back yards; the fruits being often stored under the beds. Of course, the cholera played havoc in these courts; but they are gone, the inspections are over, and I am sure the Sanitary Committee will rejoice that their unfruitful labours have come to an end in this quarter. During the year, especially in the summer, the courts and alleys, the gullies, urinals, &c., were frequently disinfected with carbolic acid-water and powder, the carbolic carts being sent round the parish for this purpose; and the acid was largely given away, in cases where infectious diseases occurred, to those who could not afford to purchase it. Complaints having been made early in the year that great nuisance arose from the offensive emanations evolved from "sweep-burning," and foul "haud-watars," a bill was distributed among all the workers in the precious metals, aud those concerned in these matters, directing their attention to the necessity of avoiding such evils, aud the methods of best preventing them. At every house where infectious disease is known to occur, handbills are left, containing instructions as to the use of disinfectants, and the best methods of preventing the diffusion of the disease. Nuisances Removed.—The removal of nuisances during the year has consisted in the disinfection and cleansing of rooms and houses in which infectious diseases have occurred; the 28 removal of accumulations of dung, of dust, of pigs, and of smoke nuisances; the prevention of overcrowding, and the illegal occupation of underground dwellings; the inspection and seizure of fish, rabbits, plucks, and meat unfit for human food; the inspection and removal of nuisances connected with the drains, watersupply, •water-closets, dust-bins, water-butts, trade effluvia, friedfish shops, &c. These matters receive daily attention. The disinfection of houses and rooms has necessarily required great increase of labour since the prevalence of the Small-pox. Almost invariably the nuisances have been removed upon the simple serving of the notices; so that legal proceedings have been required in one instance only. The sanitary works in the Surveyor's Department must not b forgotten. The Meteorology of the year was as follows :— 1877. Temperature, Average. Difference from average of 106 years. Dew-point. Humidity (Saturation = 100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 62 years.

Spring Quarter 51.9 —0.4 43.3 73 29.71 5.3 —0.5 (April, May, June) Summer Quarter 58.5 — 1.2 50.4 75 29.78 6.4 —1.0 (July. Aug., Sept.) Autumn Quarter 45.0 + 1.5 40.1 84 29.74 6.9 —0.2 (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 29 Hence the mean temperature of the whole year was slightly below the average; that of the winter and autumn quarters being above, and that of the spring and summer quarters being below the average.

At a Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 18tli December, 1873. "The Clerk called attention to the fact that since "the Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor Kate, which "duty had reverted to the Guardians or Governors of "the Poor under the Local Act, and which Board had "been revived for the purpose in November, 1871, "there was no Poor Eate Account published, except "the remainder of those in collection by the Vestry "previous to that time, and suggested whether it would "not be desirable, by an agreement between both "Boards, to publish the Poor Eate Account of the "Guardians or Governors as an appendix to the Annual "Eeports of the Vestry, in which case there would be "one and a half years' Poor Eate Account to be ap"pended to the Eeport about to be issued for the year "ended Lady-day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by "Mr. Dore, and— "Resolved that such suggestion be approved and "adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes). ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk.
