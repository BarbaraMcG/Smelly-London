Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen,—I present herewith the thirty-seventh Annual Report on the health of the East Barnet Valley Urban Sanitary District—namely, for the year 1910. The report is arranged similarly to those of previous years, and is intended for the information of your Council, and also embodies as far as possible the particulars required by the Local Government Board and the County Council, to whom copies of the report are forwarded according to statute. Physical Features and General Character of District.—The urban sanitary district of East Barnet Valley is within the administrative county of Hertford, being situate on the extreme southern portion of the county. Geographically, however, the district is almost wholly surrounded by the county of Middlesex, the exception being the north-western portion of the boundary, which adjoins the urban sanitary district of Barnet (Herts). The remaining districts adjoining the Council's area are all urban sanitary districts, situate within the county of 4 Middlesex, viz.On the north, Enfield; on the south and south-east, Southgate; on the south-west, Friern Barnet. The District Council was formed in April 1894, to succeed the old Local Board. The district comprises the parishes of East Barnet, Barnet Vale, and Monken Hadley, the total area being 2,636 acres. As its name implies it lies on the sides of a valley extending from Hadley in the north to Brunswick Park in the south. The principal portion of the district is divided by the main line of the Great Northern Railway from Kings Cross to the north, while it is also bounded on the east and west respectively by the main roads leading from London northwards through Southgate and Barnet. The general character of the District is residential; the area on the west of the railway has been conveniently planned, and consists principally of good class detached and semi-detached villa residences, the altitude varying from 200 to 400 feet above ordnance datum. The district forms a portion of a much wider area, noted for the healthfulness of its climate, and popularly known in and around the metropolis as the " Northern Heights." On the east of the railway are situate the older portions of the district, including the village of East 5 Barnet, and Brunswick Park at the southern extremity, most of which is developed for a much smaller class of property, and is consequently more densely populated. Industries and Occupations.—The industries carried on within the District are not extensive. Factories and workshops however exist for the manufacture or production, among other things, of ink; blacking; ties; piano keyboards; gas and water; boots; joinery; printing; photographic material, &c., &c. The occupations of large numbers of the workers take them outside the District, such as railwaymen clerks, police, and mechanics of various trades. The conditions of employment within the District are generally of a satisfactory character, and no circumstances exist which are prejudicial to the public health. Housing Accommodation.—The houses at present existing in the District are only sufficient for the population by a large number being utilised in the working class districts to accommodate two families, and in many instances houses are sublet to more than two families. It is regretable that under present conditions the rent of a small and suitable house is more than the average artisan, with a family, can legitimately afford, hence many are compelled to rent a portion of a house, originally built to accommodate one family only, resulting in a considerably increased density of population per acre in certain parts, together 6 with the discomfort and danger to health arising from the overcrowding of individual houses. An attempt to provide separate dwellings on the flat system was made in one part of the District a few years ago, but has not met with any success. The meagre and cramped amount of yard space attached to the buildings, together with the absence of proper amenity and convenience has militated against the popularity of the dwellings, which have in consequence developed into a very undesirable class of property. Any further provision of dwellings of this class should be rigorously opposed. The provision however of a number of small, conveniently arranged houses, with a sufficient amount of garden attached, which could be let at a rental not exceeding 6s 6d or 7s per week, would probably find ready tenants, and would greatly assist in reducing the number of houses occupied by more than one family. Population.—I estimate the population to be 13,240—an increase of about 280. This estimate is based on the number of occupied houses multiplied by 5.3, the average number of persons per house at the census of 1901. Birth Rate.—During the year 1910 there were registered 272 births. The birth rate was 20.5 per 1,000. Of the 272 births 9 were illegitimate. Death Rate.—The number of deaths that were 7 registered as having actually occurred in the District was 83, giving a death rate of 6.3 per 1,000. But 13 deaths of residents occurred in certain public institutions, viz., the Barnet Infirmary, Victoria Cottage Hospital, and the County Asylum, which must be debited to the District, raising the total number of deaths to 96, and giving a corrected death-rate of 7.25 per 1,000. This is, I believe, the lowest death-rate that has ever been recorded in the district. Infant Mortality.—Ratio of deaths under one year of age per 1,000 births registered.—Under this heading 12 deaths were registered, the death rate being 44.1 per 1,000. Nearly half those deaths were due to premature birth and congenital defects. No deaths were caused by epidemic diarrhoea—a disease prevalent in hot weather. No doubt because the summer of 1910 was like that of 1909—a decidedly cool one. Measles.—Only one death was due to this disease. A number of cases occurred amongst the children attending the Highstone Infant School towards the end of the year. The Managers desired to close the School, and with the approval of the School Medical Officer this was done for a period of three weeks, from 5th December. With this exception the district was remarkably free from measles. Scarlet Fever.—This disease showed a further 8 diminution in the number of cases notified—only 17 notifications were sent in. In 1908, 41 cases were notified. In 1909, 28. In 1910, 17. Only one death occurred, and that was due to cerebral complications. Diphtheria.—17 cases of this disease were notified—as against 24 in the previous year, only one proved fatal. The arrangements by which a speedy report on any case can be obtained from the Clinical Research Association, and the plan of keeping a supply of antitoxin at the Council offices are much appreciated by the medical practitioners in the neighbourhood. Tuberculosis.—11 deaths were due to various forms of tuberculosis. Of this number 7 were caused by Phthisis Pulmonalis, commonly known as consumption. Very little is done in this District to eradicate this disease. There is no system in force of either compulsory or voluntary notification, except in the case of those patients under the care of the Poor Law Medical Officers. Only one such case was notified. In these cases the patients are visited by myself and the Sanitary Inspector, and are instructed how best to prevent the spread of infection to others. From time 9 to time the homes are disinfected as far as possible. I suggest that the buildings that formed the old Isolation Hospital be made use of by the Joint Isolation Hospital Committee, as a sanatorium for the treatment of early cases of consumption. Milk supply.—The conditions governing the milk supply of the district are unchanged, and so far as can be at present ascertained it may be inferred that the supply is reasonably free from disease producing germs. It should be borne in mind, however, that only a very small proportion of the milk consumed in the district is produced within the district, under conditions over which the Sanitary authority, through their officers, can exercise control. The bulk of the milk supply is imported from outside areas, and is produced under conditions of which the Sanitary Authority have no official cognisance, and in regard to which they have no powers, either as regards inspection or supervision. Under these circumstances it is impossible to pronounce definitely on the purity of the supply. There are five dairy farms within the Council's area, comprising in all about 120 cows, from which an average quantity of 183 gallons per day is being distributed. This is probably not more than one-sixth the quantity consumed in the district. The Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops have been 16 periodically inspected during the year, and notices issued by the Sanitary Inspector where necessary. The structural conditions on the whole are satisfactory, but in some instances the cleanliness of the sheds leaves much to be desired. This point, together with conditions of storage by retailers, continues to receive attention. With a view to promoting more cleanly conditions in the production, storage and distribution of milk in the district, the Council have recently, acting on my advice, procured a sufficient quantity of circulars prepared by the Joint Committee on Milk of the National Health Society and the National League for Physical Education and Improvement, and containing brief instructions, in classified form, for ensuring the supply of clean milk. Three separate circulars have been obtained, and are now about to be distributed to (a) housewives and consumers, (b) distributors and retailers, (c) farmers and other milk producers. It is hoped the educational effect of these circulars will justify the slight cost. The question of the milk supply is one which is rapidly being recognised as of national importance, due in considerable measure to the presence in our midst of an insidious infectious disease—tuberculosis—which, by a general consensus of medical and scientific opinion, is largely spread by the medium of milk, and which is 11 accompanied by the appalling death roll of 60,000 per annum. It has recently been estimated that nearly 60 per cent of the milch cows of our country are suffering more or less with tuberculosis. I am of opinion that the time has now arrived when, in the interests of the public health, all cows supplying milk for public consumption should be compulsorily subjected to the " Tuberculin " test, and only the animals satisfactorily passing the test should be retained; also that Sanitary Authorities should be in a position to demand from all purveyors of milk within the district the source of the milk they supply. So far as can be ascertained no effort is at present made by the cowkeepers of the District to determine whether tuberculosis in any form exists among the herds, and until this is done, voluntarily or compulsorily, the freedom of the milk supply from infection is necessarily a question of uncertainty. Disinfection.—Rooms are disinfected by spraying with a solution of formalin. Bedding, wearing apparel, &c., are disinfected by steam at the Isolation Hospital. The disinfector—a Washington Lyons—is unfortunately rather small, a so-called 3 ft. 6 in. size, but the cage that actually holds the articles to be disinfected is only 2ft. 4 in. in width, consequently large and bulky articles, like large mattresses, and feather 12 beds must be tightly covered up and compressed to get them inside, and this must militate against thorough disinfection, at least unless much extra time is allowed. A suitable vehicle has lately been procured by the Joint Isolation Hospital Committee for conveying articles to be disinfected, from houses to the Hospital, and back again. Isolation Hospital.—This hospital remains in just the same state as described in my last Report. No alterations and no additions have been made, though the need of an observation ward and a discharge block is generally admitted. Twenty-five cases of scarlet fever and cases of diptheria were sent in from the district during the year. Water Supply.—The water supply is derived from deep wells, and is of great purity, though a little hard. The arrangements for constant water supply for the areas of the district at a higher elevation than 275 feet above Ordnance Datum Level, which was the limit of the original order of the Local Government Board, have been satisfactorily settled. The Council withdrew its Memorial to the Local Government Board upon the Barnet District Gas and Water Company undertaking to supply the Hadley 13 portion of the district above Tudor Road by pumping from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., and subsequently by pressure from the Arkley reservoir to 5 o'clock, except on Sundays, when the pumping is to be from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. The other places to be continued as at present throughout the district. This arrangement meets all reasonable demands, and no complaints of deficiency in domestic supply in the higher parts of the district are now heard. Sewage Disposal.—Water-carriage : Numerous schemes for a reconstruction and remodelling of the sewage disposal works having at various times been considered by the Council, it was finally decided to carry out certain works suggested by Mr. Stephens, one of the Members of the Council. These works consisted of opening out and improving the old detritus tanks at the Main High Level Sewer outfall, and constructing a drain to carry off the intercepted matters to a point low down on the Farm, to repair and bring into use the large settling tank which had for many years been disused, and to abolish the eight contact beds and substitute for them four circular percolating filters, with revolving sprinklers. Two of the sprinklers are completed and in use, and the other two are rapidly approaching completion. 14 The sprinklers are each 71ft. in diameter, and the average depth is, No. 1 6ft. 3 in., No. 2 5ft. 11 in., No. 3 5ft. 6 in., and No. 4 4ft. 8 in.; Nos. 1 and 2 are not yet finished. Nos. 3 and 4 are completed, and the analyses of the effluents from them have invariably given good results. It would be very useful and desirable if gauging apparatus were fixed on each of the supply pipes, so that the quantity of liquid and rate of flow could be accurately ascertained, and the exact capabilities of the filters thus found. At present there is no check upon the amount of liquid which is put upon the filters, and no means of knowing whether they are working at their proper capacity. SCHOOLS.—-The Schools in this district have been visited many times during the year—necessarily so— in connection with the medical inspection of children. The County Council schools and most of the Church schools are kept in excellent condition, but the Monken Hadley and Highstone infants schools hardly come up to modern requirements, and are difficult to keep clean. No doubt the School Managers do the best they can under the circumstances, but the buildings are not well adapted for Schools. All Schools ought to be disinfected at least twice i5 a year, during the vacations, and I hope the Council will prevail upon the Managers to carry out the practice. Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909.— The Medical Officer and the Sanitary Inspector were instructed to draw up a joint report concerning the inspection of the district, and to present it to a SubCommittee appointed to consider such report. This has been done. But as the report had not up to the time of writing been before the Council, nothing has yet been done, up to the end of the year. Since then Mr. Abbott, the Sanitary Inspector, has been appointed to do the work. Street Paving.—A new departure in the matter of paving the footpaths of the public highways in the District was commenced this year, artificial granite slab paving being used instead of tar paving. The new material makes a bright looking even path, and is generally appreciated by the residents of the District. The tar paving in many places is quite worn out, and owing to settlements of the ground and other causes, frequently holds large pools of water in wet weather, and large cracks and fissures are formed by the action of tree roots beneath the surface. The slab paving has been laid in part of Lyonsdown Road, the Crescent, Barnet Hill, Station Road, East Barnet Road at New Barnet Triangle, Lancaster Road, 16 Margaret Road, and Albert Road. A considerable extension of this kind of pavement is very desirable. Tarring Roads.—The main road (Great North Road) at Hadley, and East Barnet Road, have been surface coated with tar again this year, with most satisfactory results, both in the relief from dust raised by fast motor traffic, and in the preservation of the road surface. The objection to tar are the dull appearance of the roads during summer, and the large quantity of pasty black mud which is formed in winter. Akonia.—In order to preserve the appearance of the roads in residential parts of the District, an experiment was tried on Station Road and Park Road, by using Akonia for dust prevention. The result was highly satisfactory, the dust being effectually held down, and the appearance of the roads being similar to the effect of a very gentle watering. As the District depends largely upon its appearance for the attraction of good class residents, an extension of the use of Akonia would seem to be desirable. The Road Board.—Application was made to the Road Board for a grant in aid of tarring the Great 17 North Road at Hadley and Pricklers Hill, and the East Barnet Road, and Brookhill Road. Application was also made for a grant for treating Station Road, Barnet Hill, and the steep portion of East Barnet Road, with Akonia. The County Surveyor has, however, stated that he cannot support the application for Akonia. The result of the application to the Road Board is not yet known. Making up Private Streets.—Plans and estimates were prepared, and notices served to make up the following streets :— Park View Crescent. Spencer Road. Northumberland Road (part). Edward Grove. Old Fold Lane (part). Margaret Road (part). Local inquiries were held by the Local Government Board, and loans amounting to £2,526 were sanctioned in respect of all the streets except Margaret Road, which the Board did not consider sufficiently built upon to justify being made up. On being approached by the Council, many of 18 the owners in Margaret Road executed temporary works, which have effected a great improvement in the condition of the road. The making up of Old Fold Lane has been executed by contract, and tenders have been obtained for making up the remainder of the roads. Hadley Green Roads.—An inquiry was held by the Herts County Council as to the District Council's liability to repair certain roads on Hadley Green, and an order was subsequently made requiring the District Council to repair the following roads, viz. : The Long Road running from the Great North Road at a point near the south end of the Green, in a north-easterly direction towards Hadley Church. The road at the extreme north end of the Green, from the Great North Road, going in a westerly direction to the entrance to Old Fold Lane, and the road from Old Fold Lane going south along the west side of the Green, as far as gate by the footpath leading to the New Road. The Council has had all these roads repaired and put in order. Street Lighting.—New lamps have been erected in Northumberland Road, Alverstone Avenue, and two in Oakhurst Avenue. The Council have appointed an inspector to test 19 the quality and illuminating power of the gas, with satisfactory' results. Improvements.—Railway Arch, New Barnet. The much needed improvement of widening at the New Barnet Railway Arch was well considered and approved by the Council, and an application was made to the County Council, asking them to take steps to effect an improvement, and remove the present dangerous condition of the road. The County Council replied that they had no funds at their disposal for the purpose. Surface Water Sewers.—New surface water sewers have been constructed in Albert Road and Taylor's Lane, where none previously existed. Drainage.—The Trustees of the Children's Home Hospital, in course of erection in Kitt's End Road) outside the Council's district, agreed upon terms with the Council to allow them to connect the drains of the Hospital with the Council's sewer. Pine Cottage, Hadley.—The reconstruction of the old sewer receiving the drainage of this house and Hadley Brewery, was completed. The rain water was taken by separate drains to the surface water sewers, from 29 houses which formerly discharged into the foul water sewers. 20 Sewer ventilating shafts, 25ft. high, were erected in Willenhall Avenue and Oakhurst Avenue, and a rectangular pipe was, with the owner's consent, erected against the flank of a house in Brunswick Crescent. Allotments.—Twenty acres of land at Cat Hill were, with the consent of the Local Government Board, acquired for Allotments, for which there appeared to be considerable demand. Applications have been received for the renting of about one half of this land. Allotments at Farm.—About 2½ acres of land situate on the high portion of the Irrigation Farm, and not available for sewage irrigation, have been let as allotments to residents in the neighbourhood of Brunswick Park. Road Sweepings.—Application was made to the Local Government Board, and after local inquiry sanction was given by them to the use of about 2½ acres of land in the middle of the Allotment Ground, Cat Hill, for the purpose of a tip for road sweepings. House Refuse.—This is collected weekly. A daily collection is made from certain shops in the centre of the district. The Manager of the Boys Farm Home, where for some considerable period formerly the house refuse was tipped, having intimated that he could not dispose of 21 any more on his farm, arrangements were made to dispose of it upon the Council's Irrigation Farm, the tins and old iron being sold to a purchaser, who collects them on the refuse heap. Fire Brigade.—The members of this Brigade are retained, and comprise 18 officers and men, 4 of whom are resident at Brunswick Park, in the extreme south of the district. There are alarm posts at important points in the district, and during the year cards indicating the nearest alarm posts were delivered at every house. The rates made and the rateable value of the District since 1894 are as under : — YEAR.

Matters of this description have not hitherto appeared in my Report, but it seems desirable that all items of importance and interest should be permanently recorded, and thus become useful for reference in the future. I also append the Report of Mr. Abbott, the Sanitary Inspector, and desire to express my indebtedness for his able and ready assistance in all affairs relating to the health of the District. 23 Return of Vaccinations and Statutory Declarations of Objection to Vaccination in the East Barnet Valley Urban District, received by the Vaccination Officer during the year ended 31st December 1910 : Number of cases.

During the year several important meetings have been held in connection with the above, at which the Council have been represented. The most important of these was probably the International Conference on Town Planning, convened by the Royal Institute of British Architects, in Otober last, of which the official report has not yet been issued. So far as the town planning of all areas within a radius of 15 miles of the City is concerned an effort is at present being made to secure that all the development carried out in accordance with the Act shall be of a comprehensive nature, and part of a larger scheme dealing with the development of the whole of Greater London, in order to secure adequate protection of the many interests involved, and to avoid the lack of unity, and failure to obtain convenient continuity of planning for the whole area, which would undoubtedly result if every separate authority plans its own area, without regard to a scheme for the whole. As to what extent this desirable end will be attained, rests with the local authorities themselves. A body has been formed, known as the Greater London Advisory Town Planning Council, and up to the present forty-six local authorities have joined the Council. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ARTHUR J. ABBOTT, P.A.S.I., etc. Building Surveyor. 34 SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT FOR 1910. Me. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting herewith the Second Annual Report on the work of my department, being for the year 1910. It will be noted, however, that this is the first report dealing with a full year's work for which I have been personally responsible. During the year works have been carried out affecting eightyfour separate dwelling houses, in addition to trade and other premises, and in many cases the works have been of an extensive nature, affecting practically the whole of the sanitary circumstances of the houses dealt with, both exterior in the shape of drains, yard paving, W.C. accommodation, and removal of refuse; and interior in the form of stripping, cleansing, repairing and renovating the dwellings. The bulk of the work executed is of a permanent nature, and in carrying out same I have endeavoured to maintain a high standard as regards workmanship and materials, believing it to be in the best interests of owners of property that the work should be executed thoroughly and completely, and I desire to express my thanks to the many owners who during the year have co-operated with the Sanitary Authority in eradicating many insanitary conditions, at considerable cost to themselves, but with great advantage to the occupiers. I am pleased to again report that the year's work has been accomplished without friction, and ia no case has it been necessary to resort to legal proceedings. The mode of procedure adopted in dealing with nuisances is to issue a formal intimation of the existence of certain specified defects, and this intimation is invariably accompanied by a personal letter advising as to best 35 method of remedying same. This practice is found to be very successful. The number of statutory notices issued during the year has been eight. In many instances works have been carried out in consequence of a verbal or written communication without the service of any form of notice. Summary of Statistics. At the request of the County Medical Officer of Health, the statistics concerning the work of the Sanitary Department for the past year have been arranged, as far as possible, in accordance with a form drawn up by him in order to promote uniformity in the reports from the various Sanitary Authorities in the County of Hertford. The form, however, was received too late to permit of detailed classification under all headings, but the desired information has been given wherever possible, and the form will be found appended to this report. Public Health Act 1875. The major portion of the work of my department is carried out under the authority of this statute, and the bye-laws drawn up in accordance with its provisions. In recent years it has been considerably augmented, and its already extensive powers greatly increased by the Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1907, now in force in this district. This, together with the powers possessed under the Acts designed to deal with infectious disease, the control of factories and workshops, and the sale of food and drugs, constitute the principal factors controlling the administration of public health policy in this district. Remedial Works Executed. The following list of the principal remedial works actually completed during the year, will emphasise the value to the 36 community of the possession of the powers referred to, when exercised for the common good:- Nature of works executed. No. Houses made fit for habitation 3 ,, Dampness remedied 4 ,, Cleansed and renovated 17 „ Overcrowding abated 4 Yards provided with impervious paving 34 „ Dust bins provided 18 „ Insanitary ash pits removed 3 Accumulations of manure, and animals improperly kept, removed 21 Rain water pipes improperly acting as ventilating shafts, disconnected from drains 34 Drains, chokages cleared 24 ,, defective, repaired or portions reconstructed 13 ,, condemned, and new drainage systems laid complete 34 „ trapped 24 ,, inlet and outlet ventilating shafts fixed 65 „ new manholes constructed 44 ,, new gullies fixed 78 W.C.s condemned, and new built 4 „ new pans fixed 36 ,, repaired, lighted, ventilated, or cisterns provided 25 Various: Cesspools emptied 2 Cesspools abolished 2 Stables paved, drained, and manure pit constructed 5 Urinals reconstructed 2 In commenting upon the work of the past year I have 37 arranged my remarks under headings indicating the principal branches of the work, and have endeavoured to avoid unnecessary detail. It will, however, be understood that much of the work of my department—interviews, correspondence, supervision, &c.— does not lend itself to tabulation or report, although taking up a considerable amount of time. Drainage. Over 2,500 feet of new glazed socket pipe drains, of various sizes, have been laid during the year, replacing a similar amount of defective and obsolete drains. This work has been accompanied by the construction of forty-four manholes, while twenty-four intercepting traps and seventy-eight new gully traps have been fixed, and over sixty ventilating shafts erected. The importance of this work is considerable, inasmuch as a large proportion of the drains condemned were found passing under the dwelling houses, and in many cases the evils arising from leaky drains within the dwellings were intensified by the absence of intercepting traps, thus affording sewer gas direct access to houses. Several of the houses dealt with, including Vernon Terrace, contained two families, so that the number of persons affected by the improvements is considerable. It was found necessary to take up and entirely relay the drains to about thirty-four dwelling houses, and in order to preserve a convenient record of this work, I append the following list of dwellings, &c., redrained during the year, viz.:— *No3. 1, 2 and 3 Albert Terrace, Albert Eoad. ,, 1 and 2 Zephyr Villas, Approach Eoad. * „ 1 and 2 Norfolk Villas, Bulwer Road. * "Pelham" and "Elmhurst," Bulwer Road. *Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 Harriett Cottages, Edward Road. *1 and 2 Preston Cottages, East Barnet Road. Fern Cottage „ „ 38 Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 Grantham Terrace, East Barnet Road. „ 1 Lancaster Road., * „ 1, 2, 3, and 4 Lonsdale Cottages, Leicester Road. *" The Limes " ,, " The Ferns," Lyonsdown Road. *Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 Yernon Terrace, Margaret Road. *Stable, &c., Plantagenet Road. "Woodbank," Woodville Road. Reconstruction of drains has also been carried out to several stables, and trade premises, and partial reconstruction to other dwelling houses. The premises marked with an asterisk in above list have also been provided with separate storm water drains, laid at the expense of the Council, in continuation of the policy of relieving the soil sewers of storm water whenever an opportunity is offered by taking up existing drains, now carrying soil and storm water combined. The cost of carrying out this separation during the past year has been £88, and the storm water from twenty-nine houses has been excluded from soil sewers. Special attention has been paid to the supervision of these works of drainage, during construction, as upon the thoroughness and quality of workmanship and materials depend the ultimate value of the works put in hand as the result of the inspection of the district. 519 re-inspections of premises have been made during the year, mostly for the purpose of superintending execution of works. Cleansing of Dwelling Houses. During the year three houses have been notified to owners as unfit for human habitation, but in no case has it been necessary to ask for closing orders, as the whole 39 of my requirements have been complied with and the houses thoroughly cleansed and renovated. Notices have also been issued, in reference to the insanitary internal condition of seventeen houses (excluding houses cleansed and renovated after infectious disease), several occupied by more than one family, and the necessary works carried out. I attach considerable importance to this branch of the work, as the execution of costly works to secure perfect external sanitation is of little benefit if the internal conditions are injurious to health. It is a common experience to find the walls of old dwelling houses in the poorer class districts plastered with large numbers of inferior wall papers, held together with putrid layers of decomposing paste and accumulated filth, imparting to the rooms, often ill-ventilated and occupied by many persons, a very objectionable smell. In carrying out cleansing works I have found no less than thirteen separate papers on the walls of a room, and the change in the atmosphere after removal and cleansing has been remarkable. The Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909 confers on the Sanitary Authority power to exercise control over the state of repair of houses let to the working classes, which will assist in dealing with injurious conditions of the nature referred to. Factory and Workshops Act 1901. As indicated in my last report the registers of factories and workshops which must be kept by the Sanitary Authority in accordance with the provisions of the above Act were greatly in need of revision, only four factories and twenty-five workshops being recorded. I have now ascertained the number of these premises actually in existence to be : Factories 15 ; Workshops 56; and a new register has accordingly been prepared. Inspections of these premises have been made throughout the year, and notices issued for:—cleansing and lime washing where 40 necessary; abatement of nuisance by animals bring improperly kept where food was being prepared; also for defective sanitary accommodation and absence of proper W.C. accommodation. In every case the notice has been complied with. Two communications have been received from H.M. Inspector of Factories. The premises referred to have been inspected, the defects remedied and a report of the action taken forwarded to the Factory Inspector in accordance with the provisions of the Act. An anonymous complaint alleging very injurious conditions of employment was investigated and found to be without substantial foundation. Outworkers. The act requires all firms within the district distributing work to employees to be done in their own homes to forward half yearly to the Sanitary Authority lists of the names and addresses of all such outworkers. No lists have been received from firms within the district, but four lists have been sent in by outside authorities giving the addresses of persons resident in this district receiving outwork from firms in the localities notifying same. These houses are inspected to ensure cleanly conditions, and to prevent the spread of infectious disease by the removal of goods from infected houses. Bakehouses. Nine bakehouses now exist within the district, one additional bakehouse having been erected during the year. Three of this number are underground premises. Undesirable and unsatisfactory structural conditions exist on one or two of these premises, but improvement is impracticable apart from entirely discontinuing the use of the premises. The cleanliness of the bakehouses, however, is satisfactory, and but few notices have been necessary. All the premises have been inspected by your Medical Officer and Inspector. 41 Sale of Foods and Drugs Act. The special duties of inspection and procuring samples of articles of food are in this district undertaken by the County Council of Hertford, who employ an Inspector for this work. I have obtained from the Inspector the following particulars of samples taken within the Council's area during 1910, viz.:— Milk 7 Rice 4 Butter 2 Cheese 1 All the samples were returned as being " genuine." Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops. During the year I have compiled a new register of these premises, the number now in existence within the district being as follows :— Dairies and Cowsheds 7 Milkshops 10 These are in addition to various retailers delivering daily in the district from premises situate outside. Thirty-six visits of inspection have been made to these premises, and notices have been given both in reference to Cowsheds and Milkshops for the execution of necessary improvements. The question of revising the bye-laws controlling these premises is now before the Council. The majority of the premises in the district are kept with due regard to the importance of scrupulous cleanliness in all matters relating to milk supply. The possession of ample powers is however necessary to deal with possible defaulters, and the milk industry being one which constantly passes into the hands of fresh proprietors, who are often without experience, calls for constant watchfulness to ensure efficient 42 supervision of the conditions under which milk is produced and distributed. I am therefore giving this matter special attention. Slaughter-Houses. Pour slaughter-houses exist within the district; one of these, however, has now been disused for some time, although still attached to butcher's premises. One slaughter-house is quite modern, and its condition satisfactory. The other two are of a very old type and suffer the usual disadvantages of poor arrangement and convenience. The present owners, however, are most careful in securing proper use and cleanliness of the premises, which go far to mitigate the disadvantages of inconvenient premises. Improvements have been carried out during the year in accordance with my requirements, and the need for further alterations has been communicated to two owners aud is receiving their consideration. Numerous visits have been paid to these premises during the year. Offensive Trades. No action has been necessary under this heading. Bye-laws are in force in the district dealing with the whole of the offensive trades enumerated in section 112 of the Public Health Act 1875, in addition to certain other trades, none of which are, however, at present established in the district. A communication from the Local Government Board calling attention to the powers given by section 51 of the Public Health Acts (Amendment Act) 1907, of declaring trades, other than those enumerated in section 112 of the 1875 Act, to be Offensive Trades, has been considered, but no action has been deemed necessary. Pried fish shops and rag and bone stores exist in the district, but no nuisance is at present created and therefore no need for special bye-laws has arisen. 43 Disinfection. The practice of the Council to immediately disinfect the rooms in which cases of dangerous infectious disease have occurred, has been adhered to throughout the year, the work being carried out under my personal supervision. Disinfection has been carried out after the following notified cases:— Scarlet Fever 17 Diphtheria 17 Tuberculosis 1 The disinfection is done immediately a patient is removed to Hospital, or in the case of those isolated at home, on receipt of a certificate from the medical attendant that the patient has passed the period of infection. This is followed by a notice to the owner requiring walls to be stripped and paper burnt, and walls, ceiling, floor and woodwork to be again washed with carbolic acid. This completes a thorough disinfection of the room, and the method has proved to be very satisfactory. In addition to the foregoing, several private houses have been disinfected at the request of residents after non-notifiable diseases, including tuberculosis and cancer. This work is done at the expense of the Council, in accordance with their resolution to disinfect free of charge, after all cases of infectious disease, when so requested. Four elementary schools have also been disinfected by the Council during the year, at the expense of the Managers. It is to be regretted that all the schools of the district have not had the advantage of disinfection during the vacation, the cost being comparatively little, while the purifying effect is considerable. The provision of a suitable vehicle by the Joint Isolation Hospital Committee, for conveying infected clothing, &c., to the Steam Disinfector, has met a need felt for some time, and in 44 reference to which several representations have been made by the Council. Prevention of Infectious Disease. In investigating the sanitary condition of bouses in which cases of infectious disease have occurred, I have many times discovered grave sanitary defects, and, the disease being directly traceable to no other source, it can be reasonably inferred, particularly in reference to Diphtheria, that a direct connection exists between the defective sanitary arrangements and the infection. This has been noticeable in the cases of children stricken with Diphtheria, who have been ascertained to have a weakness for playing with sanitary fittings, which were subsequently found to be defective. This being so, the extensive sanitary works carried out during the year, and at present proceeding, should be of permanent benefit in checking the spread of disease known to be carried in sewer and drain air. Sanitary Legislation, 1910. The principal item needing attention under this heading is The Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations 1910, issued by the Local Government Board under the Housing and Town Planning Act 1909. The regulations have been reported on in detail jointly by your Medical Officer and Inspector, and after being investigated by a sub-committee, have received the careful consideration of the Council, with the result that the immediate inspection of the first portion of the Council's district has been authorised, and is being put in hand forthwith. The comprehensive nature of the investigations to be made under these regulations cannot fail to make the records of the inspections of great value, as in course of time they will constitute the sanitary 45 history of each separate dwelling, the possession of which will be a considerable benefit in future sanitary administration, in addition to which the remedial works which will in many cases follow inspection will undoubtedly have a very beneficial effect on the conditions under which large numbers are now living. Sanitary Congress, 1910. I desire to express my thanks to the Council for affording me the opportunity of representing the District at the Congress of the Royal Sanitary Institute held at Brighton in September last. The Congress is organised in the interests of public health, and is attended by delegates from all parts of the kingdom. In addition to the discussions on subjects of importance in public health administration, an exhibition of sanitary appliances is held, constituting the finest collection of apparatus, including the latest inventions in sanitary science, to be seen at one place. The educational value of the Congress is very great, and the experience gained therefrom is incorporated into the routine work of the year to the advantage of the District. I appreciate being permitted to continue attending the Congress, the advantages of which I have now obtained for several years past. In conclusion, I desire to acknowledge the consideration and support I have received from the Council in carrying out the duties of my office, and to assure the Council of my continued efforts to promote the sanitary welfare of the District. I beg to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ARTHUR J. ABBOTT, P.A.S.I., Associate Royal Sanitary Institute, Member Institute Sanitary Engineers. 46 Summary of Sanitary work executed in 1910.
