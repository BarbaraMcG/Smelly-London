With regard to this outlying portion of the Parish, the following extract from Cromwell's History of Clerkenwell will be of interest, especially to those unacquainted with its history:— 22 "There is a small detached portion of the Parish, situate at Muswell, or Muswell Hill, about five miles and a half from London, and on the northwestern confines of Hornsey. This little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of London, about the year 1112; and having become famous through a legendary tale of a ' great cure performed upon a King of Scots, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell,'a Chapel was erected on the spot, 'sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell.' Here was placed an image of ' Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.' This Chapel (which of course was an appendage to the Nunnery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth; and when Norden wrote, an Alderman Boe had 'a proper house occupying the site.' " "The Wells, from which this tract and the hill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed besides from the field wherein they are situated by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, cheir waters differ in quality; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea River.' "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes place septennially; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line (as is signified by the usual initial affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assert their long established boundary." . This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 154 houses and pieces of land in assessment. 23 Election of Vestrymen and Auditors. —At the Meeting of the Vestry of the 14th April, 1898, the seat of Mr. N. H. Strickland, who had resigned on the ground of illhealth, was declared vacant. The annual Election of Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts took place on Tuesday, May 17th, 1898, when the following members were returned:— WARD No. 1 (PENTONVILLE). [Number of Electors, 2085.

[No Nomination]. The Expenses of the Election amounted to £97 18s. 6d. There being no nomination for an Auditor of Accounts for Ward 5, the Vestry requested the County Council to take the necessary steps to fill the vacancy, and suggested Mr. George Tripp, of 17, Amwell Street, as a suitable person to fill the vacancy; to which the Council replied that they had received the nomination of Mr. F. Wyard, of 75, Pentonville Road, and asked for the views of Vestry in the matter. The Yestry replied that 25 having regard to the fact that Mr. Tripp's illness was the cause of his not being nominated, and that he has had three years' experience as an Auditor, they adhered to their nomination. The Council then informed the Vestry that unless one of the candidates is withdrawn it may be necessary for them to order a fresh election, upon which the Council were informed that the Audit had been held, when they took no further action in the matter. Decease of Member.—The Vestry regret to record the death during the year of the Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., Vicar of St. James's, Clerkenwell, on the 28th April. The Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., had been connected with the Parish for 30 years, viz., for seven years as Curate under the late Dr. Robert Maguire, and for twentythree years as Vicar, having been elected in 1875 by a large majority, in open polling extending over three days. The resolution of the Vestry upon the announcement of his death was as follows:—That this Vestry desires to place on record its deep regret at the sudden death of the Rev. J. H. Rose, M.A., Vicar of Clerkenwell; its high appreciation of the faithful services rendered by him in many ways during the past thirty years, and begs respectfully to offer to Mrs. Rose and family its sincere and heartfelt sympathy in the great bereavement that has fallen upon them. Vote of Condolence.—The Vestry received with deep regret the intelligence of the decease of the Rt. Hon. W. E. Gladstone, which took place on the 19th May, and respectfully tendered to Mrs. Gladstone and her family its deep sympathy in the loss they have sustained by the death of Mr. Gladstone, whose high character, ripe scholarship, and distinguished and prolonged service to the State mark him as one of the greatest men of this century. Meetings.—Under the Byelaws of the Vestry, Standing Committees are appointed at the first Meeting of the Vestry after the Annual Elections, and Special Committees are appointed from time to time to deal with special questions, and it is at the Meetings of these Committees that a very large quantity of the detail work of the V estry is carried out. The following statement shows the number of Meetings held by the Vestry and the various Committees during the year, and will also show the parishioners that the administration of their local affairs is no light task, but is one which entails considerable labour on those who come forward to take part in the municipal work of the Parish :— Vestry 41 Special Committee of whole Board 1 Works Committee 54 Wharf Committee 10 Open Spaces Committee 4 Electric Lighting Committee 3 Works SubCommittee '2 Public Health Committee 25 Drainage Committee 6 Valuation Committee 15 Finance Committee 14 Law and Parliamentary Committee 3 Town Hall Committee 24 Petty Sessions 8 Aylesbury Place Area Committee 10 Various Special Committees 4 Deputations 2 226 27 Rates.—During the year the Rates made by the Vestry were as follows:— For the Halfyear to Michaelmas, 1898. A Poor Rate of 1s. 8d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £38,260 A Sewer Rate of 1d. „ „ „ 1,660 A General Rate 1s. 1d. „ „ „ 21,580 2s. 10d. 56,500 For the Half year to Ladyday, 1899. A Poor Rate of 1s. 8d. including a Library Rate of 1d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £33,800 A Lighting Rate 2d. „ „ „ 3,380 A Sewer Rate of 1d. „ „ „ 1,690 A General Rate Is. Id. „ „ „ 21,970 3s. 0d. 60,840 The Rates made in April, for the halfyear to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £424,701, and those made in October, for the half year to Ladyday, upon a rateable value of £430,436. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £34,524 in the first, and £32,911 in the second halfyear, total £67,435. The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £3,441 19s. 2d. and £3,550 11s. 10d. in the first and second halfyears respectively. The amounts above stated as being required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union included the Precepts of the London County Council, whose rate is now collected in the Poor rate, whereas the requirements of the Metropolitan Board of Works were raised by a separate rate called the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Council's precepts 28 in respect of the Parish of Clerkenwell amounted to £23,936 4s. 2d., divided into portions of £11,968 2s. 1d. in the first, and £11,968 2s. 1d. in the second halfyear. Under the Local Government Act constituting the Council, it receives from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue the produce of local taxation licenses, including licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, for game, dogs, guns, auctioneers, tobacco, carriages, hawkers, pawnbrokers, armorial bearings, &c., &c., together with twofifths of the probate duty paid within the County of London. From these hitherto imperial funds the Council pays certain public grants formerly paid from the Imperial Exchequer for Teachers in Poor Law Schools, Public Vaccinators, Registrars of Births and Deaths, Pauper Lunatics, Poor Law Medical Officers, and the Metropolitan Police. The balance of the Exchequer Contribution Account remaining after payment of these grants is carried to the General County Account, and from this Account the Council have to pay to the Guardians of every Poor Law Union wholly in London a sum equal to 4d. per head per day, for every indoor pauper maintained in that Union. The share of the Parish of Clerkenwell of the later amount for the year ending Ladyday, 1898, is £7,886, the amount being based on the average number of indoor paupers so maintained during the five financial years ending on the 25th March, 1888. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £8,549 9s. 9d., collected as part of the Poor Rate. The Library Commissioners precept at 1d. in the £ amounted to £1,675, and the cost of Registration of Voters, Collection of the Poor Rate, and other matters under the control of the Overseers and the Guardians or Governors of the Poor amounted to 29 £1,430, which added to the sums abovementioned, made the Poor Rate precepts as sent by that Board to the Yestry £66,987, to meet which the Poor Rate of 67,140 was levied. The precept of the School Board for the year 1898, amounted to the sum of £20,983 11s. 10d., which is collected as part of the General Rate It will thus be seen that of the £117,340 raised during the year, the sum of £86,765 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry; or in other words, of the total rates of 5s. 10d. in the pound for the year, 4s. 3¾d. was for other bodies, and 1s. 6½d. for the local administration, paving, lighting, dusting, slopping, &c. An average of 1,119 summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates in each quarter of the year. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons summoned are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand" for payment, preferring to pay the small fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money as a matter of convenience, as long as possible. That this is so is patent from the fact that only five per cent. of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. An average of 22 committal warrants per quarter were granted in respect of nonpayment of rates, the majority of the cases being those of persons who set the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied; and it may be taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large majority of these cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. 30 An average of 9 cases per quarter were excused by the Justices on account of poverty. Four Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out during the year dealing with 162 assessments, and increasing the rateable value by £11,545.

(1) Services of the County Council 15.38 (2) Services of the Local Authorities paid out of the County Fund. (i.) Payment to the Guardians of the Poor of charges formerly paid for out of Imperial Funds. This is a relief of local poor rates - 3.78 (ii.)

Payment to the Common Council of the City of London for maintenance of pauper lunatics Net amount required for the year 19.16 Receipt from the Exchequer Contribution (license and probate duties and beer and spirit duties) 3.65 Balances brought forward 1.51 5.16 Amount of rata levied 14.00 A penny rate over the whole county produced to the Council in 1898-99 a sum of about £152,400. Metropolitan Board Precepts.—A list of the Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, to the coming into force of the Local Government Act, 1888, in March, 1889, will be found in previous reports. 32 Garden Rates—At the request of the Committees of Inhabitants the vestrv raised a rate of 6d. in the pound for the maintenance and management of the enclosed garden of Holford Square, and a rate of 5d. in the pound for Lloyd Square, to be assessed on the occupiers of the houses in the Square. London (Equalization of Rates) Act.—The principle of the Act is that a rate of 6d. in the pound per annum forms the Equalization Fund; the parishes contributing according to their rateable value, and receiving according to their population; parishes of a high rateable value and a small population having therefore to contribute to the fund, while those of a low rateable value and a large population receive a grant from it. The net amount received from the fund by the Parish of Clorkenwell for the year ending 31st March, 1899, was £3,349 17s. 1d. Collection of the Rates.—Of the Rates made in the Parish of Clerkenwell, a percentage of about 94 is actually collected, 6 per cent. being irrecoverable from allowances to owners who compound, empty houses, runs, and excusals on the ground of poverty. It follows therefore that when the Parish is called upon to satisfy the precept of some central body, such as the County Council or the School Board, which is stated to be at the rate of say Is. in the pound, an actual rate of nearly 13d. must be made to produce the amount required. Rates Raised in 1898-9.—The Vestry have been furnished with a return by the London County Council, showing the amount in the pound of all rates raised in the County of London for the year 83 ending 31st March, 1899, distinguishing the rates raised for county and for parish purposes, and of rates raised in the principal boroughs and parishes in tne immediate neighbourhood of London. The return shows the central rates at 4s. 2.09d. in the pound, and the total rates of the various parishes ranged from 4s. 11d. in St. James, Westminster, to 8s. 7d. in Bow, the average being 6s. 0.32d.; Clerkenwell with rates amounting to 5s. l0d. in the pound, standing very favourably on the list, 53 parishes having rates higher, and only 21 having rates lower. Parliamentary Representation.—The Parish of Clerkenwell forms the Central Division of the Parliamentary Borough of Finsbury, and is represented in Parliament by the Hon. W. F. B. MasseyMain waring.

Bound over in £5 to be of good behaviour. Sale of Food and Drugs Act.—The Vestry again draw attention to the fact that thev have made arrangements for the analysis of private purchasers' 45 samples of food and drugs, and have decided that any resident of the Parish (traders excepted) shall be allowed, upon payment of '2s. 6d., to bring to the Vestry any article of food or drugs purchased or delivered in the Parish, for the purpose of being tested by the public Analyst. Should the sample submitted prove to be adulterated, the report will be handed over to the Inspector ot the district, with the name and address of the seller, for the purpose of his taking samples in conformity with the Act, and if in that case the sample be found to be adulterated, the 2s. Gd. deposited by the person bringing the sample will be returned to him. The rule has been printed on the back of the ratepapers, but up to the present time little advantage has been taken of the arrangement by the parishioners. Death of Mr. R. E. Paget.—The Vestry have to record with very deep regret the death of their Vestry Clerk, Mr. R. E. Paget, which occurred on the 6th October. Mr. Paget had been in the servicc of the Vestry for 27 years, and succeeded his father in the office of Vestry Clerk in 1892. A special informal meeting of the members of the Vestry was called, and after many and eloquent testimonies as to the splendid services rendered by Mr. Paget, of his unfailing kindness and courtesy to all, and to the sterling integrity of his character, the following resolution was passed: — " That the members of the Vestry of Clerkenwell hereby record their deep sorrow at the great loss they and the Parish have sustained in the death of their esteemed Vestry Clerk, Mr. R. E. Paget; their very high appreciation of hit work and worth, and their desire to offer to Mrs. Paget and family their sincere sympathy with them in the sad bereavement that has overtaken them." Mr. Paget was accorded a public funeral, when a large number of Vestrymen, officials, vestry clerks, 46 and parishioners paid their last respect to his memory. Election of Vicar. -The Vestry received a report from the Churchwardens of St. James, Clerkenwell, who were appointed Returning Officers at a public meeting of the ratepayers held at the Town Hall on May 25th, stating that the various resolutions then passed were duly carried out and a poll taken by ballot on June 21st from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the result that 3,737 ratepayers voted and the Rev. Cuthbert Joseph Parker, M.A., was elected by 2,698 votes, and was introduced to the Vestry on the 22nd September. The expenses of the election, amounting to £69 7s. 2d., were paid out of the General Rate. Widening of St. John Street.—Re-building of Horse and Groom P.H. —In February, 1898, the Vestry in view of the widening of St. John Street called the attention of the County Council to the re building of the "Horse and Groom" P.H. in the narrow part of St. John Street, and urged them to do all in their power to prevent rebuilding or to obtain the setting back of the line of frontage. A deputation was also appointed to wait upon the Council. The Improvements Committee of the Council informed the Vestry that the suggested improvement was desirable, but that the Council possessed no statutory powers for the compulsory acquisition of the land needed for widening the thoroughfare, but that the Vestry could however, arrange for the setting back of the public house under the powers conferred by the Act 57 George III., Chapter 29 (Michael Angelo 'Taylor's Act), and also stated that if the V estry exercised those powers the Committee would 47 recommend the Council to indemnify the Vestry against all cost; to which proposal the Vestry acceded and passed the following resolution: — That for the improvement of St. John Street, and for the public advantage, the Vestry do hereby resolve to widen such street on the west side thereof between Albemarle Street and Aylesbury Street, and that so much of the hereditament No. 137, St. John Street, and known as "The Horse and Groom" P.H., as lies between the roadway and the red line on the plan marked "A," dated the 20th day of September, 1897, and signed for the purposes of identification by the Vestry Clerk (including cellars and areas does and is hereby, pursuant to the Act 57, Geo. III., c. 29, adjudged to project into, obstruct, or prevent the widening, extending, continuing, or opening of St. John Street aforesaid and that the possession or occupation or purchase thereof will be necessary. The Vestry also appointed the Council's valuer and solicitor to act on their behalf. The Council itself, however, refused to indemnify the Vestry against costs, and the notices to treat were therefore accordingly withdrawn St. John Street Widening.—A deputation, appointed by the Vestry have again waited upon the Improvements Committee of the London County Council and stated the Vestry's arguments that this should be undertaken by the Council as a Metropolitan improvement; when the Committee promised that the representations should be duly considered. Price of Gas. The Vestry convened a Conference of delegates from Vestries and District Boards north of the Thames, and within the area of supply of the Gas Light and Coke Company, to consider the best means of resisting the further exorbitant charges of the company, such conference was held 48 On the 28th March, 1898, when the following resolutions were passed:— 1. That in the opinion of this Conference of Delegates from Vestries and District Boards within the area of supply of the Gas Light and Coke Company, the time has arrived when a Board of Trade enquiry should be held into the past and present management and working of the Gas Light and Coke Company, their existing statutory rights and the past results, financial and general, of the statutory sliding scale of price and dividend, with a view to putting an end to the existing anomaly whereby gas consumers on the north side of the Thames have to pay 3s. per 1,000 feet as against 2s. 3d. per 1,000 feet charged on the south side. 2. That as the conversion and consolidation of the Company's stocks and the making of certain of such new stocks into Trustees' stocks under the Bill now before Parliament would enhance the Stock Exchange value of the Company's undertaking by a very large sum, the Conference is of opinion that Parliament should refuse to pass the Bill unless the Company make some substantial concession to the consumers in the form of a reduction in the price of gas. 3. That the London County Council be asked to make every effort to oppose the Bill unless such concession is made. 4. That, in the opinion of the Conference, it is desirable that public meetings of gas consumers be called in each of the Parishes affected to support the local authorities in the action they are taking, and also that they should request their representatives in Parliament, and on the London County Council, to use their utmost effort to assist the object for which the Conference has been called. 5. That a copy of the foregoing resolutions be sent to the President of the Board of Trade, to all the Vestries and District Boards north of the Thames, and to all the Metropolitan Members of Parliament, and that they be requested to support same. The Vestry also received a letter from the Holborn District Board, forwarding resolutions passed at a meeting of the Joint Committees of 49 well, St. Luke's and Holborn District Board, upon the subject of the Gas Companies' charges, and asking the Vestry to share the expense of placing a strong case before the Committee of Enquiry of the House of Commons, and to appoint a delegate; whereupon the Vestry agreed to contribute to the necessary expenses, and appointed Mr. Tripp as its delegate. Some doubt, however, was raised as to whether the Metropolitan Local Authorities are legally entitled to expend money raised by rates in promoting an enquiry into the gas company's charges, the opinion of Counsel was therefore taken by the Holborn Board of Works. The case and opinion is as follows: — Case. For the Joint Opinion of Counsel and Opinion of Alexander Macmorran, Esq., Q.C., and H. Courthope Munroe, Esq. The Local Authorities of the Metropolis outside the City of London were incorporated by "The Metropolis .Managemen Act, 1855" (18 and 19 Vic., Cap. 120), and they have various powers conferred on them by that Statute and the Acts amending the same. One of their powers and duties is that of lighting the streets and places within their respective districts by the erection and maintenance of a sufficient number of lamps, for which purpose they are empowered to make and levy a lighting rate, and are constituted the Lighting Authorities, with powers to enter into any necessary contracts for supplying gas or other illuminant in such lamps as they may see fit. These powers with reference to lighting are contained in Section 90 of the first above-mentioned Act, and in consequence thereof the Lighting Authorities are very large consumers of gas for street lighting. The expenses incurred by the Local Authorities in carrying out their duties under the Statute are provided for under Section 158, which set forth how the sums of money required by them are to be raised. The accounts of the Local Authorities are audited by auditors appointed under Sections 11 and 12, and in accordance with the 50 provisions of Sections 192, 194 and 195, the last-named Section giving the auditors powers of surcharging. In pursuance of the letter dated 28th December, 1898, addressed by the Secretary of the Local Joint Committee to the various Local Authorities, and copy of which is found with Counsel's papers, a meeting of that Committee was held on January 18th instant, at which delegates from certain Local Authorities attended in conference with a view of deciding on a course of action to be taken on the enquiry before the Select Committee. The case with the opinion of Mr. H. Courthope Munroe was read, when the question was at once raised by one of the delegates as to whether the Local Authorities of the Metropolis have power to spend money in furthering the objects of this enquiry, and in obtaining the evidence of witnesses to be placed before the Parliamentary Committee. The expenditure is likely to be somewhat large, and before the delegates would bind either themselves or the Authorities they represent to any expenditure, they decided to obtain the opinion of counsel on the point at an early date. It may at once be said that the Metropolis Management Acts nowhere expressly empower the Local Authorities to spend money in promoting enquiries of this kind nor do they empower them to incur a like expenditure in opposing Bills in Parliament. The Local Authorities, however, have always considered they are entitled by implication to oppose any Bill in Parliment which are regarded as detrimental to the interests of their Districts, or which they desired to have amended, and they have constantly exercised this implied power. Further, it should be remembered that the Standing Orders of the House require that before Tramway Bills or Electric Lighting Bills are considered that they should be approved by the Local Authorities concerned, and the Gas Acts of earlier days set out in Michael and Will's Book refer to the Local Authorities, including the Metropolitan Board of Works, now the London County Council, as the Local Authorities for gas purposes. Section 2 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1897, 60 and 61 Vic., Cap. 56, empowers Local Authorities to aid any water consumer in his action against Water Company, and this may have misled some people into thinking that the Local Authorities could not proceed against a Water Company before that Act was passed, but it is evident this Section is only required to enable them, although they may have no grievance themselves, to 51 assist individuals who may feel aggrieved without being charged with the crime of maintenance. In dealing with the gas question we may regard the Local Authorities simply as very large consumers of gas (as, in fact, they are for public lighting), who have a grievance against the Gas Companies, and, in that capacity, they have asked for the enquiry, and, at the same time, the inhabitants generally are benefiting by the ventilation of their grievance. Counsel will please advise the Committee, having regard to these facts, whether the Local Authorities of the Metropolis, as gas consumers, are justified in spending money raised by rates in the manner indicated by, if necessary, appearing before the Select Committee by Council, and obtaining and paying for the attendance of witnesses before that Committee. Holborn Town Hall, 20th January, 1899. N.B.—The case above referred to contained a history of how the Parliamentary Enquiry originated, and the opinion advised as to the evidence to be given. Opinion. We have perused the accompanying papers, and, in our opinion, the facts therein stated are not sufficient to justify the Local Authorities of the Metropolis as gas consumers, or otherwise, in spending money raised by rates for the purpose of defraying the expenses of appearing before any Select Committee of Parliament that may be appointed to deal with the Metropolitan Gas Companies' charges. The Local Authorities of the Metropolis are statutory bodies having only the powers and duties expressly given to them by statute, and it is only in the case of their rights, privileges and duties being attacked and imperilled that they have powers to expend money in their defence out of the rates—See "Bright v. North." 2 Ph. 216, and "AttorneyGeneral v. Mayor of Brecon," L. R. 10. C. D. 225. The Local Authorities of the Metropolis (other than the London County Council) have no power to promote Bills in Parliament, and it is from the principles above stated that they derive their frequently exercised right to oppose, at the expense of the rates, Bills introduced into Parliament affecting their rights, privileges and duties. A case much in point to the question upon which our opinion is sought, is that of the "Attorney-General v. Mayor of Swansea," L. R. 98, 1 Ch. 602. The Corporation were there restrained from applying their funds to the cost of opposition before Parliament of a Bill promoted by a gas company which 52 affected the price of gas in the borough. North, J., held that the fact that the Corporation, who were large consumers of gas for the purpose of public lighting and other purposes, might as such gas consumers have to pay more for their gas if the Bill passed unopposed, did not make the Bill an attack on their privileges, rights and duties, and that, therefore, they could not spend their funds in opposing it. The fact that the object for which it is desired to incur expense is one for the public benefit of the inhabitants of the Metropolis, affords no sufficient warrant for so doing—See "Reg. v. Mayor of Sheffield," L. R. 6, Q. B. 652. It was in consequence of this last mentioned decision that the Borough Funds Act, 1872, was passed, which entitles the public authorities therein specified to prosecute or defend legal proceedings necessary for the promotion or protection of the inhabitants of their district at the expense of the rates; but this Act does not extend to the Metropolis (see Section 11), and there is no similar statutory provision, giving the Local Authorities of the Metropolis a like power. The cases of the "AttorneyGeneral v. The Vestry of Bermondsey," L. R. 33, Ch. D. 60, and the "Attorney-General v. The Vestry of Camberwell," 71 L. T. N. S. 478, are decisions also bearing upon the question under consideration, and are adverse to the legality of the proposed expenditure. In these circumstances, as above stated, we are unable to advise the Metropolitan Local Authorities that they may lawfully expend out of the rates the moneys necessary in connection with this inquiry. ALEX. MACMORRAN. H. COURTHOPE MUNROE. February 9th, 1899. Supplemental Opinion on Case submitted 20th January, 1899. Since writing our opinions in this case our attention has been directed to the provisions of Sec. 92 of "The Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855," which was not present to our minds at the time, and also to the opinion of the present Mr. Justice Channell when at the Bar. We entertain some doubt as to whether the words "public concerns" in that Section are wide enough to include the matter in question, but having regard to the opinion expressed by Sir A. M. Channell, which is entitled to the greatest respect and which was given, we understand, with reference to a very similar matter, it must be admitted that there is considerable colour for the claim made on behalf of the Local Authorities, and that it is arguable that they are entitled to deflay the necessary expenses out of the rates. The case referred 58 to, in our opinion, of "The Attorney-General v. The Mayor of Swansea" L. R. /98 1 Ch. 602, in which the facts were somewhat similar to the present, was a decision upon the general law applicable to corporate bodies and with reference to a country borough, but this can have no bearing on the construction of SecLion 92 of the Act of 1855. Apart from Section 92 we are still of opinion that the view taken by us is the correct one. ALEX. MACMORRAN. H. COURTHOPE MUNROE. 22nd January, 1899. Triangular Plot of Land, Rosebery Avenue.— In March, 1898, the Vestry again renewed its offer of £100 for the triangular plot of land in Rosebery Avenue by Exmouth Street. The Council replied regretting their inability to accept the Vestry's offer of £100 for the purchase of lot 35 for the purpose of an underground convenience, whereupon the Vestry offered the Council £350 for the land, and asked, in the event of their non-acceptance of same, whether they would be prepared to let same on a long lease, and, if so, upon what terms, and after further negu tiations the Council eventually agreed to accept the Vestry's offer of £100 on condition that the Vestry should pave it, plant trees thereon, and maintain it as an air space, and the deed of conveyance was duh executed and the purchase completed. The Vestry gave permission during their pleasure to the Pluto Hot Water Syndicate to fix up on the plot one of their Pluto lamps similar to the one working in Leicester Square, which, in addition to providing cold water free, supplies, at a cost of ½d., a cup of tea, coffee, or cocoa, or a quart of boiling water, on condition that they put Welsbach incandescent lights in the lamp of from 100 to 150 candle power. The plot was opened on the 7th February, by A. Mill ward, Esq., J.P., Chairman of the Vestry. 54 Sale of Land in Rosebery Avenue—The attention of the Vestry was called to a paragraph in the report of the Corporate Property Committee on the London County Council, which states that Mr. Chambers has purchased the plots Nos. 33, 34, ana part of 36, Rosebery Avenue, from the Council for the sum of £1,950, when they expressed their regret that the Council should have sold the freehold of the lots in question, and also requested the Council to state the reasons which led them to depart from the assurance previously given, in its letter of the 22nd February, 1898, that "the Council has endeavoured, so far as it legally can, to provide for the removal of the buildings on the sites at the end of 20 years, and for the erection of more substantial buildings according to plans to be approved by the Council, at a cost of not less than 15s. per foot super." The Corporate Property Committee replied that they were unable to find that the passage alluded to contains any "assurance " whatever. Brave conduct of Gunner Hall, R.A., and James Wright.—The Vestry have much pleasure in placing on record its appreciation of the heroic conduct of the soldier William Hall, in rescuing at the risk of his own life five persons from imminent death, in a house in Clerkenwell Close; and of a lad named James Wright, who by ascending the stairs amidst dense poisonous fumes, throwing open a window, and calling for help, so materially assisted in saving life. They also forwarded particulars of the brave deed to the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for War, and respectfully suggested that after due enquiry, they might be able to represent to Her Majesty that the conduct of Gunner William Hall 55 and James Wright is deserving of recognition, either by the bestowal of the Albert Medal or in some other way. The Secretary of State replied regretting his inability to recommend the Queen to award the Albert Medal as suggested by the Vestry. A Committee was also formed to receive subscriptions from the Vestrymen and their friends for a presentation to commemorate the occasion. As a result Gunner Hall was presented with the Vestry's resolution engrossed upon vellum together with a purse of £12, and the lad James Wright received a similar vellum together with a purse of £4. Gunner Hall was also presented with a silver match box by Mr. Daldorph and James Wright with a silver medal by Mr. Walton. Telephone Service.—The Vestry appointed delegates to a Conference held at the Guildhall on the 1st March, 1898, representing the London County Council, the Corporation of London, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, upon the subject of the National Telephone Company's Bills in Parliament, when the following resolutions were passed:— 1. That in the opinion of this Conference the powers sought by the National Telephone Company would, if granted and exercised, seriously prejudice the rights and powers of the several Local Authorities, and would be inimical to the interests of the State. 2. That in the opinion of this Conference, representing the London County Council, the Corporation of London, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, the Bills being promoted by the National Telephone Company in Parliament should be most strenuously opposed. 3. That the Authorities represented at this Conference be requested forthwith to petition against the said Bills and to ask their representatives in Parliament to 56 pose the Bills on second reading, and to take every possible measure to prevent the same from becoming law. 4. That, in the event of the Bills being promoted by the National Telephone Company passing the second reading, the Corporation be asked to arrange another Conference, with a view to decide as to the best means of continuing the opposition to the said Bills. To which resolutions the Vestry have agreed. The Vestry also appointed delegates to a Conference between representatives of the Council and of London Local Authorities held at the County Hall on June 14th, upon the subject of the London Telephone Service, when the following resolutions were passed:— 1. That in the opinion of this Conference the present Telephone Service of the London area, as supplied by the National Telephone Company, is both inefficient and inadequate; that the charges, as compared to those made by the same company in the provinces, are much too high, and that these disadvantages to London are largely due to the abandonment by the Post Office of that principal of competition which was expressly adopted prior to 1892 for the protection of telephone users. 2. That this Conference views with alarm the action of the Post Office in using, for the benefit of the National Telephone Company, its special powers as to the breaking up of streets, as instanced in the recent case of the Commissioners of Sewers and the Post Office; and urges the Select Committee on Telephones, which is now sitting at the House of Commons, to preserve intact that control over the streets which has hitherto been vested in the Municipal Authorities. 3. I hat, in the event of the Post Office not undertaking the Telephone Service, it is desirable that the local and central authorities of the London Telephone District should at once combine to secure for the county an efficient and cheap Municipal Telephone Service. The Vestry also expressed its entire concurrence with, and satisfaction at, the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on telephones, 57 and respectfully urged upon Her Majesty's Government, in the interests of the commercial community, the desirability of giving early effect to its recommendations. The Vestry have, in view of the probability of the telephones being taken over by the Postal Authorities in the near future, refused permission to the National Telephone Company to open trenches in a short section of St. John Street and Clerkenwell Road. Electric Lighting.—The Vestry have received a letter from the County of London, etc., Electric Lighting Company, calling attention to their charges for motive power in the district, which are 6d. for the first hour's daily use and 2d. beyond one hour's daily consumption of the maximum demand; also stating that they are prepared to supply current for public lighting at 3d. per unit, or to supply lamps and current at £30 per lamp per annum, and also giving notice that from 1st July, 1898, their rates will not exceed 7d. for 1½ hours of average daily use, and 3d. in excess of that consumption. The Vestry have refused its assent to the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company for a Provisional Order for the lighting of the Parish. The Vestry also decided to co-operate with the Vestry of St. Marylebone in petitioning Parliament to confirm the Provisional Orders granted to the Vestries of Bermondsey and St. Marylebone by the Board of Trade for the supply of electricity in their respective districts; and requested the Hon. W. F. B. Massey-Mainwaring, M.P., to support the Bill. Generating Stations for the Supply of Electricity in Bulk.—The Vestry appointed delegates 58 to a Conference between representatives of the London County Council and the London Local Authorities on the above subject, when the following resolutions were passed:— 1. That this Conference regards it as essential to the interests of London as a whole that the present purchase clause of the Electric Lighting Acts, which applies to defined areas, should also be made to apply to such companies as propose to supply electric energy in bulk to the whole of London without regard to area. 2. That while preserving intact the rights of the local authorities with regard to electric lighting and energy, in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that the London County Council should be in a position to undertake, if it so determine, and if so requested by the Local Authority, the supply of electrical energy in bulk for the convenience of any districts desiring to be so supplied, provided that the Council does not become competitive with the Local Authority. 3. That in the opinion of this Conference power should be retained to the Local Authority to object to overhead wires for traction purposes, and to have a provisional veto against the granting of an order to any private company. 4. That, with reference to Question 1—Answer (b), of the report of the Joint Select Committee, this Conference is of opinion that all existing undertakings should share in the advantages suggested by these clauses. 5. That as regards Question 3 in the report of the Joint Select Committee, the Conference is of opinion that it should be left to the Local Authority to decide the route. 6. That the Chairman of the Highways Committee of the London County Council be empowered to present to Parliament the resolutions arrived at by the Conference with reference to the supply of electricity in bulk. I he Vestry agreed with such resolutions as helping Local Authorities in any scheme for the supply of electricity within their area. 59 The Vestry also decided to oppose the following clauses in the report of the Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament upon the subject:— "The Committee are of opinion that while it may be advisable to maintain the veto of Local Authorities as to the erection of overhead wires, given by Section 14 of the Act of 1882, in respect of other electric wires, it is not advisable that in the case of overhead wires for traction purposes the Local Authority, other than the London County Council and County Boroughs, should have an absolute veto. While due weight should be given by the Board of Trade to the representations of local authorities, the Committee think that in the case of wires for purposes of traction, it would be sufficient to give a locus standi to such Local Authorities. "The Committee consider that the provisions of the Electric Lighting Act, 1888, which require the consent of the Local Authority as a condition precedent to the granting of a Provisional Order, should be amended. In their opinion, the Local Authority should be entitled to be heard before the Board of Trade, but should not have, so to speak, a provisional veto only to be dispensed with in special cases by the Board of Trade." Library Rate.—The Vestry have ascertained the opinion of the Local Government Board and their solicitors, Messrs. Boulton, Sons and Sandeman upon the question of the unexpended balance of the Library Rate, who both advise that it should be carried forward to the Library Account for the next ensuing financial year. The Vestry also opposed a suggestion of the Battersea Vestry that the Library Rate should be increased. Lighting of Claremont Mews.—As the lamps in these mews were frequently getting broken and the Mews being private property the Vestry gave the New River Company three months notice that they would remove their lamps. After considerable 60 respondence and a memorial having been received from the inhabitants thereon, the company (who do not admit any liability) offered without prejudice, to renew the lamps, which were very old and decayed, and to place a refuge round the centre lamppost for its protection, if the Vestry will undertake to maintain same, to which proposal the Vestry assented. Bolton Court.—The Vestry have received a communication from Messrs. Few and Co., the solicitors of the Marquis Northampton, stating that the Marquis is willing to do all in his power to assist the Vestry in securing the demolition of Bolton Court. Proposal to abolish Private Slaughter Houses. —A deputation of master butchers headed by Mr. F. Redman, attended the Vestry to protest against the proposal before the London County Council to abolish private slaughter houses and to establish public slaughter houses in London under their control. The Vestry opposed the proposal and invited the other Vestries and District Boards of London to co-operate with them, to which the Vestry received 24 replies, 15 being against the establishment of public abbattoirs, four in favour, and five took no action. Milk Warranties.—The attention of the Vestry was called to the dismissal of a summons against a farmer for giving a false warranty to a retailer in regard to milk purchased by him, a summons against whom had previously been dismissed on production of such warranty, and that as the case illustrates the very defective state of the law in regard to warrant ies, as the retailer who gets a warranty is protected, 61 whilst the farmer giving the warranty cannot be reached; they directed that a report of the case be forwarded to the Local Government Board, calling attention to the urgent need of amendment of the law, and to the other local authorities of the Metropolis asking them to take similar action, when 21 Vestries and District Boards agreed to co-operate with the Vestry and six took no action in the matter. Byelaws under Public Health (London) Act.— The attention of the Vestry has been frequently, drawn to the fact that new buildings in this parish have been erected to plans approved by the District Surveyor or the County Council, and after the building is up, application is made to modify the bye-laws relating to water-closets, soil pipes, etc., because it is difficult if not impossible to comply with them. These details being the province of the Vestry, do not seem to receive the consideration of the Council, yet the Vestry are not furnished with the plans; and cannot therefore see that the requirements of the bye-laws are being provided for. The necessity is therefore shown for the Local Authorities to be furnished with copies of the plans of new buildings, they therefore called the attention of the Council to the matter, and communicated with the other sanitary authorities of the Metropolis inviting their support, when 19 Vestries and District Boards supported the action of the Vestry and four took no action in the matter. The County Council replied stating that the Building Act Committee had come to the following conclusions upon the points raised, viz.: — 1. That the suggestion that all district surveyors should devote the whole of their time to the duties of district surveying, could not be carried out without obtaining 62 parliamentary power: the Committee would, however, point out that the principle advocated is being gradually adopted by the Council as fresh appointments are made, 13 district surveyors having already been appointed who give their whole time to the duties of their office. 2. That the question of paying district surveyors by salary having been considered by the Council on two occasions, the Committee are not at present prepared to alter the existing system of payment by fees until they have had further experience of its working. 3. That although the proposal that an office should be provided for the district surveyor at the local vestry hall has much to recommend it, the Committee do not see their way to recommend the Council to take any steps in the direction indicated, as unfortunately the districts do not coincide with the local government areas, and parliamentary power might be required before the suggestion could be carried out. 4. That a notice should be printed and posted up in the office of each district surveyor, explaining that the authority of the district surveyor does not extend to drains, water-closets, or other sanitary matters which in accordance with the Metropolis Management Acts, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are under the control of the Local Authorities. (This notice will be provided and issued by the Council to the district surveyors in due course.) The Vestry regret that the Council has not been able to meet the wishes of the Local Authorities in the matter, and directed that a letter be sent to the Local Government Board asking that the suggestion in clauses 1, 2 and 3 be incorporated in the Bill in the new London Government Bill, and that the districts of District Surveyors be made to coincide as far as possible with the Local Government areas Need for Greater Police Protection.-The Vestry have again drawn the attention of the Home Secretary, the Chief Commissioner of Police, and Superintendent Hammond of the "G" Division to the increasing lawlessness and cases of robbery and 63 violence in Clerkenwell, and also strongly urged the Vestry's oft-repeated plea for additional police protection of the inhabitants and property of Clerkenwell. They also directed that a communication be sent to the Home Secretary expressing the opinion of the Vestry that the leniency shown towards offenders when brought before the magistrates at the Clerkenwell Police Court is very largely the reason for the alarming state of things now existing in the parish. They also had their attention called to the impending removal of the Police Station in Old Street for the widening of the street, when they directed that a communication be sent to the Commissioner of Police and to the Home Secretary, asking that another station may be provided in the same locality. Fire Escape at King's Cross.—The Vestry have urged the London County Council to establish a fire escape and a fireman's box in the vicinity of King's Cross, and that such escape in charge of a fireman be maintained during the day as well as at night. The Council, however, could not see their way to do so, but have since informed the Vestry that a horsed fire escape will be kept at the Farringdon Road Station and that the fire escapes in St. John Street Road and Guildford Street will be withdrawn. Inter-communication in London by Underground Electric Railways.—The Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, upon the subject of Intercommunication in London by Underground Electric Railways, stating that they have made representations to the London County Council, requesting them to oppose the railway schemes referred to 64 upon the general principle that any further underground railways of this character for London should be based upon a considered and formulated plan of inter-communication throughout the county generally, to be defined by Parliament itself, and not left to the companies to take what routes they please, without reference to the present and prospective needs of the constantly increasing population of the , Metropolis and its surrounding suburbs, with which opinion the Vestry concurred. Workmen's Wages.-The Vestry have had before them a letter from the Masons, Paviors, Rammermen and Labourers, asking for an increase of wages, and after very carefully considering the whole question, have decided that the Masons, Paviors, Rammer men and Labourers be engaged by the hour, at the the ordinary Trade Union rate of wages, on and after May 1st, 1899, and that a practical road foreman be engaged at 50s. per week. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890— 9, 10, and 11, Claremont Mews.—The Vestry have received a representation from their Medical Officer of Health certifying that the houses No. 9, 10, and 11, Claremont Mews were in a state so dangerous to health as to be unfit for human habitation; they therefore directed that notices under the provisions of section 32 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, be served upon the owners of the houses specified in the above representation to make the houses fit for habitation, and that in default of compliance with such notice, proceedings be taken at the Police Court for prohibiting the use of the premises for human habitation. Small Open Spaces.—The Vestry appointed Mr. Robson , J.P., as a delegate to a conference of 65 sentatives of the local authorities, convened by the Parks and Open Spaces Committee at the County Hall, Spring Gardens, on the subject of the mainten ance of Small Open Spaces, such Conference was held on the 25th June, when the following resolution was passed:— That the maintenance and control of all open spaces under 10 acres be undertaken by the sanitary authority for the district. That the London County Council grant annually to the sanitary authority the amount of the cost of such maintenance and control, such sum to be equal to the amount of the average expenditure per annum for the preceding three years upon the maintenance and control of such open spaces; and such annual grant to be subject to a certificate of the Council's officials, that the expense has been incurred and the work properly carried out. The Vestry agreed with the resolution passed by the Conference, and urged the Council to approve same, and carry it into effect. The Vestry also thanked Mr. Robson, J.P., for his attendance at the Conference. Trade Obstructions on Highways.—At a Conference of Vestries and District Boards, held at the Guildhall, on the 8th December, to consider the question of costermongers' stalls and trade obstructions on highways, the following resolutions were passed:— That in the opinion of this Conference the various Acts of Parliament having reference to Trade Obstructions on Highways in the Metropolis, should be amended and consolidated under one Act. That in the opinion of this Conference the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis should be the Authority to decide under what conditions Costermongers and others causing obstructions shall be allowed to stand in any street within their respective districts. The Vestry agreed to support a memorial to the Home Secretary in favour of these resolutions. 66 Fines and Costs at the Police Court.—The attention of the Vestry was called to the insignificance of the fines and costs inflicted by the magistrates at the Police Court upon owners of houses neglecting to carry out the orders of the Vestry, it often happening that cases are simply adjourned for defendants either to commence or to complete the work ordered, and then only a nominal fine is inflicted, and in some cases they are only ordered to pay the bare cost of the summons, no allowance being made for the loss of time of the various officials engaged in the case, they therefore sent a few typical cases of insufficient fines to the Home Secretary and asked him to take steps to ensure penalties by the magistrates that would have a deterrent effect upon those who ignored the notices issued by the inspee tors. Band Performances by County Council.-The Vestry asked the County Council to arrange for band performances to be given within the Parish of Clerkenwell, and suggested that Spa Green would be a suitable place for the purpose, but the Council, in view of the heavy traffic in Rosebery Avenue next the open spaces referred to, and the noise occasioned by same, were not prepared to allow band perform ances in the places suggested, and therefore asked the Vestry to indicate some more suitable place, to which the objections referred to would not apply As, however, Spa Green is the only suitable place for the purpose the matter was dropped. Charges for Road Watering.—The Vestry had before them a copy of the judgment delivered by Mr. Hopkins, one of the magistrates at the Lambeth Police Court, on an application made by the 67 beth Vestry for his decision on the amount to be paid for water supplied for road watering purposes, which was that the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company were only entitled to payment by the Vestry at the rate of 6d. per 1,000 gallons instead of 8½d. as hitherto paid. The Vestry accordingly communicated with the New River Company upon the subject, who thereupon reduced their charges to 6d. per 1,000 gallons, thereby effecting a saving of £56 12s. per annum to the parish. Workmen's Compensation Act, 1897.—The Vestry have considered the question of the desirability of the London Local Authorities forming a mutual assurance fund from which claims under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1897, could be met, but they have decided to await the working of the Act before pledging themselves to any scheme. Collier Place.—The Vestry have received a letter from Messrs. Stanley, Evans and Co., solicitors, 20, Theobald's Road, stating that some clients of theirs desired to pull down the whole of the existing houses in Collier Place and to build model dwellings, thus closing the courtyard altogether and giving a frontage only in Collier Street. The Vestry resolved to offer no opposition to the closing of Collier Place, provided the applicants bear all the expenses at the Quarter Sessions. Cheap Trains Bill.—The Vestry had before them a letter from the National Association for the extension of workmen's trains, forwarding copy of Cheap Trains Bill, introduced by Mr. Sam Woods, M.P., and asking the Vestry to support same, and to oppose any measure to confer new powers upon any 68 Railway Company running through the Parish, unless proper provision is made for workmen's trains, to which views the Vestry agreed. London Water Supply.—The Vestry had before them a letter from the Vestry of Battersea, asking the Vestry's opinion whether the water supply of London should be vested in a public authority, and if so, what authority, to which the Vestry replied (1) That they are in favour of the water supply being vested in a public authority; and (2) That such authority should be under Government. The Vestry also had before them the draft of a Bill prepared by Mr. H. S. Samuel, M.P., by which it is provided that the Metropolitan Water Companies shall within three months after the passing of the Act (unless the Local Government Board shall by provisional order extend the time) make such junction or junctions of their mains as may seem to the Local Government Board to be necessary for the effective supply of water by any one or more of the said companies to any one or more of the said companies, but the Vestry took no action in the matter. London Overhead Wires Act, 1891.—The Vestry has appointed the Surveyor Inspector of Overhead Wires, to take any action under the powers granted to it by the London Overhead Wires Act, 1891, and to enforce the bye-laws made under the Act by the Council. Indication of Fire Alarms.-The Vestry had before them a letter from the County Council, on the subject of the Vestry indicating the positions of lire-alarms by means of painting the lamp-posts in the near vicinity a bright red colour, and inserting 69 in the top of the lamps nearest thereto, a strip of red glass with the words "Fire Alarm" in white letters, and it appearing that only eight lamp-posts and lamps would be affected thereby, the Vestry have adopted the suggestion of the County Council, for which the Council have thanked them. New Warehouse, Clerkenwell Close.—The Vestry have considered an application for consent by the County Council to the erection of a warehouse building at the South-west corner of Clerkenwell Close, and it appearing that the building is already erected, and that it greatly impedes light and air to the entrance of Warden's Court, the Vestry strongly oppose such application, and ask the County Council to preserve intact the entrance to Warden's Court, and also directed the Medical Officer of Health to report as to whether the building is contrary to any sanitary laws, as a building impeding light and air to the inhabitants of the Court referred to, such report to go with the Vestry's protest, and that the two representatives of Clerkenwell be informed of the action the Vestry have taken, asking them to do what lies in their power to assist the Vestry in the matter. As a result of the Vestry's opposition the Council refused its consent to the retention of the building, and instructed its solicitor to take the necessary proceedings to enforce compliance with the law. Bye-Laws for regulation of Lamps, Signs, etc., overhanging Public Way.—The Vestry have considered a draft, prepared by the County Council, of proposed bye-laws under Section 164 of the London Building Act, 1894, for the regulation of lamps, signs, and other structures overhanging the public way, not being within the City, and as it is proposed 70 to prevent trade lamps being lower than a clear 10 feet from the footway, and that such a height would in a large number of cases prevent the lighting of shop windows, they suggested to the Council that such height be altered to eight feet. London Government Bill.—The Vestry, in view of the great changes as proposed in the London Government Bill, appointed a Special Committee of 13 members of the Board to watch the interests of Clerkenwell, and to report to the Board from time to time. Upon the recommendation of the Committee the Vestry called a Conference, consisting of the Special Committee, the Chairman and Clerk of each of the following Boards, viz:—St. Luke's Vestry, and Holborn and St. Giles District Boards of Works, together with their Committee, to consider the position of the districts under the London Government Bill. A report of the Conference will appear in next year's annual report. Site of Old Vestry Hall.—The Vestry record with satisfaction the completion of the annex to the Town Hall on the site of the old Vestry Hall. The Vestry, owing to a dispute between Mr. B. E. Nightingale and the Plasterer's Union, and the consequent delay in completion, did the plastering work themselves without the intervention of a contractor with satisfactory results. The building is now let in conjunction with the other halls in the main building. A kitchen has also been fitted up for letting, at a cost of £130. Drainage of Clerkenwell detached.—The Vestry also record with pleasure the completion of the drainage works at Muswell Hill, a full report will be 71 found in the Surveyor's report, page 130. The Vestry also desire to record its entire satisfaction with the way in which the Surveyor has carried out the whole of the work from the drawing of the first plan to its successful completion. The Vestry have also entered into an agreement with the Wood Green District Council for taking part of the surface water drainage at the sum of Is. per house per annum, the Vestry being recouped by the London and Middlesex Freehold Land Society. Muswell— The Vestry have again made application to the London Financial Association that this old well, which is situate in this Parish, might be transferred to the Vestry to be preserved as an historical relic, but no reply has been received. Approved by the Vestry, Sept. 14th, 1899, G. RAY BROWN, Vestry Clerk pro. tem.

Collection and disposal of House Refuse.— This year, being the first complete year in which the system of a weekly house to house collection of dust, &c., was carried out, we are able to show the cost, and efficiency of the system. During the year 120 applications were received for the removal of dust, 104 of which were received during the first 24 weeks, the number during the last 28 weeks being only 16, and for 20 separate weeks not a single application was sent in. The number during the previous year was 1,847. Each house was visited once a week; the Model Dwellings and public dust bins were emptied twice a week. 10,332 loads of dust and trade refuse were removed. 97 Upon the dust arriving at the Wharf, it is sorted and screened; the ashes and breeze, and other saleable articles extracted, being sold. During the year the Committee entered into a contract with Mr. H. Chambers, of Faversham, for the purchase of the ashes and breeze at an increased price, the amount received for same being £1,491 14s. 4d., or £368 6s. Od. in excess of the previous year's receipts. The receipts for sundry articles sold amounted to £140 2s. 7d. The broken crockery ware, clinkers, &c., were sent away as hardcore in 14 barges at a cost of £64 8s. Od. The remainder of the refuse, consisting principally of rubbish, was burnt in the furnace. The increase in the sale of the ashes and breeze has enabled the system to be carried out practically without any increase in the expenditure. As the amount of rubbish received is greatly on the increase it was necessary to keep the furnace burning day and night, including Sunday, (and also to occasionally hire barges, and send it away in the rough), to prevent accumulation on the Wharf. The furnace became in such a dangerous condition that the Vestry decided to erect a "Destructor" that would be capable of not only burning the refuse previously burnt in the furnace, but the soft core and vegetable refuse at present barged away. A contract was entered into with Messrs. Joseph Baker & Sons, of Willesden Junction, in November last. During the building ot the Destructor the rubbish was sent away with the street sweepings and hardcore in "lighters," instead of separately as before. The number of "lighters'' hired was 48, and the cost £460 3s. 6d. 98 The following statement shows the cost incurred for the above:— £ s. d.

Street Cleansing and Disposal of Refuse.—The cleansing of the Parish was carried on by night and day gangs the main roads being swept at night by two machine brooms, and two gangs of seven sweepers each, including ganger. The remainder of the streets and courts were swept daring the day by one machine broom, and two gangs of eight sweepers each, including ganger, on alternate days. The market streets and a number of adjoining streets were also swept on Sundays. 99 The number of loads of sweepings received were 7,025, an increase of 910 loads on the previous year, or over 17 loads per week. The cost of Collecting and Disposing of the Dust and Trade Refuse from March 26th, 1898, to March 25th, 1899, inclusive, was as follow:— ] £ s. d.

Two horses, "Brooks" and "Millward," which had been in the Vestry's service for a number of years, were sold at Rymill's Repository 23rd September, and realised 6 and 8½ guineas respectively. On the 5th October two horses were bought of Mr. Seymour for £182, and on the 26th October one more was purchased from Mr. Quilter for £75.

The following additions and alterations to the public lamps in the Parish have been made during the year. The contract with Mr. Clark for maintaining the incandescent installation in Pentonville Road was renewed for 1 year.

The Street Watering was done by the Vestry's own vans. Extra horses and men were hired on 113 days, the average number being 8.21. 5,697,000 gallons of water were used. The total cost was as follows:— Horse Hire, including driver 463 1 0 Wages of own Carmen 15 12 6 Keep of Horses 6 13 3 Repairs to Water Vans 83 11 6 Repairs to Standposts 49 2 8 Cost of Water, including Rent of Meters 237 9 5 £855 10 4 The length of the streets to be watered is approximately 20 miles; the cost per mile thus being £42 15s. 6d.; the cost of distributing the 5,697,000 gallons was Is. 8£d. per 1,000 gallons. 123 In consequence of complaints having been received calling attention to the dusty state of the streets on Sundays, 6 water-vans were ordered to be out on Sundays, from 6 to 10 am., when necessary. TREES. The total number of trees in the public streets is 230, planted as follows:— St. John Street Road 18 Pentonville Road 9 Penton Street 23 Clerkenwell Green 25 Clerkenwell Close 2 Upper Chadwell Street 4 Rosebery Avenue, between Farringdon Road and Holborn boundary 43 Rosebery Avenue, between Farringdon Road and St. John Street Road 106 Total 230 Six additional trees were planted: 2 on the triangular plot of ground in Rosebery Avenue by Exmouth Street, 1 in Rosebery Avenue, by Fire Station, and 3 on Clerkenwell Green. 124 The whole of the trees are now maintained by the Vestry. Only 2 trees required replacing with new. CLEANSING OF STREETS. The sweeping of the streets was carried out as follows Two gangs each consisting of 6 men with ganger, and two machine brooms were employed to sweep each main road in the Parish every night, and the remainder of the streets were swept not less than three times a week, and a considerable number every day, by 2 gangs of sweepers consisting of 8 men each including ganger, and one machine broom. The whole of the day sweepers were also employed on Sunday morning generally clearing up the streets; the market streets were also cleared at mid-day. Temporary Sweeping Gang.—A temporary gang of sweepers was employed as required, the wages of which was £139 13s. 6d. The number of loads of street sweepings removed was 7,025 being an increase of 910 loads or an average increase of 17 loads per week. The average number of horses employed was 11-27 per day? including those with the brooms. 125 The approximate cost was as follows:— £ s. d. Slopmen's wages 924 18 0 Scavengers' ,, 2,022 5 7 „ (teinpy. gang) 139 13 6 Keep of Horses 352 12 6 Cost of barging slop away 874 9 0 Loading barges 235 15 2 Brooms for sweeping machines 57 16 0 Scavengers' brooms 64 11 0 Repairs to sweeping machines 2 6 0 Hire of horses and vans 153 11 3 £4,828 1 0 DESTRUCTOR AT WHARE. The furnace at Wharf having become absolutely useless the question as to whether it was desirable to rebuild same, or to have a destructor built, that would not only burn the paper, but the whole of the soft core, was very carefully considered by the Works Committee. Destructors were inspected at Bradford and Leyton, and it was decided to advertise for tenders for a two-cell destructor capable of burning the whole of the paper and soft core sifted from the dust taken to the Wharf. The following tenders were submitted:— Messrs. Beaman and Deas, £1,097 not including roof. 126 Messrs. J. Baker & Sons, £1,089 including roof. The Horsefall Syndicate, Ltd., £1640 6s. 8d., including roof. and the tender of Messrs. Joseph Baker & Sons was accepted. Considerable difficulty was experienced in constructing the destructor, the depth required below the surface of ground was 12 feet, but owing to the treacherous nature of the ground, it was found necessary to carry the foundations 8 feet lower, the destructor is therefore built on 8 feet of solid Portland cement concrete. The destructor was not completed at the date this report ends. STREET IMPROVE MENTS. Rosoman Street by Garnault Place.—Upon the completion of the Town Hall extension I called the attention of the Town Hall Committee to the desirability of throwing the ground previously enclosed by iron railings, at the corner of Rosoman Street and Garnault Place, into the public way, so that the carriageway could be widened at that point. The Committee accepted such suggestion and requested the Works Committee to have same carried out, which was accordingly done. Widening White Lion Street — The "White Lion " P.H., High Street, at the corner of White 127 Lion Street, having been rebuilt and the line of frontage in White Lion Street set back considerably, the Vestry, upon the application of Captain Penton, reformed and repaved the eastern end of this street. UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCES. Application was made by the British Sanitary Works, Ltd., for permission to construct underground conveniences at the expense of the Company, the Vestry to supply light and water, the Company to maintain same, and at the expiration of 30 years to hand same over to the Vestry free of all costs or charges. After considerable negotiations between the Works Committee and the Company the Vestry agreed to give the Company three sites, viz., at the junction of Pentonville Road and King's Cross Road ; Rosebery Avenue, opposite Fire Station, and Clerkenwell Green, opposite Sessions House. The three conveniences were commenced but neither opened at the date this report concludes. TRIANGULAR PLOT, ROSEBERY AVENUE BY EXMOUTH STREET. The Works Committee after a very considerable amount of negotiation prevailed upon the London County Council to sell to the Vestry this piece of 128 ground for £100, upon the understanding that the Vestry would pave same and maintain it as an open space. The Committee endeavor to get a fountain placed in the centre of the ground, by the Metropolitan Drinking fountain and Cattle Trough Association, but the Association stated that they had no available funds. Application was made by the Pinto Automatic Lamp Syndicate, for permission to fix one of their automatic tea, coffee, (fee., lamps, and undertaking to have a free tap for cold water—and the Vestry granted such permission. CLEEKENWELL GREEN 1MPEOVEMENT. The carriageway paving of Clerkenwell Green being in a defective condition, the Works Committee were of opinion that considerable improvement in the appearance of same would be affected, and the cost of repairs lessened, if two portions in the centre were formed with 2 large refuges, East and West of Clerkenwell Close. Plans were prepared, and the Vestry decided upon the recommendation of the Committee to plant the Eastern refuge with trees, and that the drinking fountain be fixed one end and the cattle trough the other. On the Western refuge the underground convenience previously mentioned is in course of construction. 129 ROSEBERY AVENUE, BY FIRE STATION. The question of reforming the footways and carriageway in Rosebery Avenue by Fire Station has repeatedly been before the Works Committee, and when the arrangement was arrived at with the British Sanitary Works, Limited, to construct an underground convenience at this point it was decided to continue the footway of Farringdon Road to a point opposite the line of footway on the South side of Exmouth Street, and return the Kerb in Rosebery Avenue to the North side of entrance to Fire Station, thus forming practically a refuge with the underground convenience in the centre; to clear away the small refuge between the two entrances to Fire Station, thus giving a perfectly clear run-out for the Fire engines, and to pave a foot-way from the West side of entrance to Coldbatli Square, and to plant extra trees on same. MUSWELL HILL. Plans were approved of a proposed new road to be called Curzon Road irom Muswell Road to Alexandra Park Road. COLNEY HATCH LANE. Upon the application of the owner of the ground at the corner of Colney Hatch Lane and Barnard 130 Hill, the Vestry agreed to fix kerb and pave channel between Barnard Hill and Birkbeck Road upon the condition that the line of frontage was set back at the owner's expense. NEW SEWTERS, MUSWELL HILL. The construction of the new sewers in Clerkenwell detached which was in progress at the date of last report has been completed. The sewers vary in depth from 4 ft. 6 in. to 38 ft. 6 in. and in several cases the sewers fall the reverse way to the surface of the road. The whole of the sewage is discharged into the Friern Barnet sewer at the north-east boundary of the Parish. John Hay ward, the sewer foreman, had charge of the work during the whole time the same was in progress, and the Vestry on completion increased his wages to £2 per week and also granted him the sum of £15 in appreciation of the care and diligence in supervising, what, in many cases owing to the nature of the sub-soil, was very difficult and arduous work. The total cost of the new sewers, reconstruction of surface water sewers, and laying in frontages to the houses, ventilating columns, penstock and fittings, &c., was £6,044 2s. l0d. A portion of surface water sewer in Alexandra Park Road and Muswell Avenue was also laid by the Vestry's own men at a cost of £132 6s. 11d. 131 The whole of the works were carried out without the slightest accident and it was only necessary to make two slight alterations to the original plans. The sewers have worked in a most satisfactory manner since the completion of the works. Flushing Sewers, Muswell Hill.— The Vestry decided to have six hydrants fixed at convenient points for flushing the sewers at above. SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE. Negotiations have been proceeding between this Vestry and the Wood Green District Council for a considerable time with reference to the surface water of tbat portion of the Parish which has a natural drainage towards Wood Green District, and it was eventually agreed that this Vestry should pay to the Wood Green District Council the sum of one shilling per house per annum, upon all houses that are connected with any surface water sewer that is connected with the surface water sewers belonging to the Wood Green District Council, subject to the London and Middlesex Freehold Land Society paying to the Vestry the sum of £150. 132 OPENING OF SQUARES. It was decided to open the Squares at 8 o'clock in the morning, instead of 9, during the months of June, July, August, September and October. From 1st November to the 1st March, the Squares were closed on Sundays. The question of the various public gardens maintained by the Vestry received great attention from the Works Committee. A Sub-Committee was appointed and many alterations and improvements were made. I have now adverted generally to the principal works in my department, upon which I have been engaged during the past year, and the appended schedule will show the cost of such works. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, P. GORRINGE KILLICK, Surveyor. 133 Abstract of principal paving and other works executed during the year 1898-99, and the cost thereof.

To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my third Annual Report— upon the sanitary condition of the district of Clerkenwell. I have followed the course adopted last year, and as the population enumerated in 1891 and again in 1896 shewed a loss of only 14, I have looked upon ours as a stationary population, and taken as a basis for all my birth and death-rate calculations the numbers actually found in the enumeration of 1896, namely, 66,202. The births registered in the district during 1898 were 2,072, a number slightly less than that recorded for 1897, which was 2,092. The general birth-rates throughout the country are similarly slightly less than those of the previous year. Our birth-rate works out at 31.2 per 1000, for 1897 it was 31.6 per 1000. The number of intra-parochial deaths occurring in Clerkenwell from all causes in 1898 was 933. Last year it was 966, and the annual average for the past ten years is 1,036, so that the deaths are respectively 33 less than last year and 103 less than the average. 142 The annual average number of births for the past 10 years is 2163, the births and deaths being distributed throughout the parish as follows district. deaths. births. St. James 216 487 Amwell 499 1,037 Goswell 218 548 933 2,072 Table of Births and Deaths for the past 10 years. years. deaths. births. 1889 1,033 2,277 1890 1,184 2,204 1891 1,171 2,222 1892 1,125 2,175 1893 1,183 2,106 1894 807 2,180 1895 1,038 2,083 1896 923 2,223 1897 966 2,092 1898 933 2,072 These 933 intra-parochial deaths with a population of 66,202 give a death-rate of 14 per 1,000. Last year it was 14.5. While it gives me pleasure to report a gradual fall in the intra-parochial death-rate, as frequently pointed, out from our peculiar circumstances, it is of no real value for purposes of comparison with other districts, or assistance in forming correct conclusions as to our sanitary condition. Besides the 933 deaths occurring in the district, 493 Clerkenwell residents died in various hospitals and institutions outside the district, and these being added give a total number of 1,426 deaths, yielding a total death-rate of 21.5 per 1,000. This, our true death-rate, though considerably higher than the rate for Registration London, which is only 18.3 per 1,000, compares not unfavourably with that of our immediate neighbours in 143 Central London, Holborn having a rate of 24.9, and St. Luke's 25.7, Islington with its large population, living under much less crowded conditions, has the highly favourable rate of only 16.6, a death-rate which we cannot hope to equal, though a slight improvement upon last year 13 to be noted when our death-rate was 21.9 per 1,000. The following is a list of the outlying Public Institutions and other places where residents of the Clerkenwell district died during the year :— North Western Fever Hospital 25 Western Fever Hospital l Eastern Fever Hospital 12 London Fever Hospital 1 St. Mary's Hospital 1 Guy's Hospital 2 Middlesex Hospital 2 King's College Hospital 1 Great Northern Central Hospital 1 University College Hospital 8 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 60 Royal Free Hospital 33 Brompton Consumption Hospital 5 Royal Chest Hospital 7 Cancer Hospital, Fulham 2 French Hospital 3 London Hospital 1 Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street 17 Shoreditcb Infirmary 1 Mildmay Cottage Hospital 1 Central London Sick Asylum 1 Leavesden Asylum 3 Charing Cross Hospital 3 Banstead Asylum 2 City of London Lying.in Hospital 3 St. Pelagia Creche 1 144 Ilford Asylum 2 St. Luke's House, Osnaburg Street 1 Islington Infirmary 1 Central London Throat and Ear Hospital 1 Cave Hill Asylum 1 Darenth Asylum 1 Heart Disease Hospital 1 London Temperance Hospital 1 Bethlehem Hospital 1 Colney Hatch Asylum 8 Holborn Infirmary 142 Holborn Workhouse, City Road 96 Mitcham Workhouse 13 Hanwell Asylum 3 Caterham Asylum 10 St. Peter's House 1 St. Pancras Infirmary 1 338, Mare Street, Hackney 1 Thames, Wapping l Police Station, Dalston Lane 1 Wyman's, Fetter Lane 1 2, Hemingford Road, Islington 1 Amhurst Road, Hackney 1 19, Holmes Road, Kentish Town 1 Wormwood Scrubbs Prison 1 Freidenheim 1 Ethridge Street 1 Thames, Rotherhithe 1 Regents Canal 1 The deaths occurring in the Parish from the seven principal zymotic diseases, viz., smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, typhoid fever and diarrhoea were 217, a number considerably higher than the average for the past 10 years, which is 176. To these must be added 67 deaths which occurred in the various hospitals outside the district, making a total of 284, giving 145 a death-rate of 4.28 per thousand. This number is somewhat higher than that which we are debited with by the RegistrarGeneral, which is only 8.76 per thousand, the difference being caused by the inclusion of deaths from gastro-enteritis under the head of diarrhoea; these, though registered under a different name, are undoubtedly identical diseases with a probable bacterial origin. The number and causes of death from zymotic diseases occurring in Clerkenwell during the last ten years are exhibited in the following table:— SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLETFEVEK. DIPHTHERIA.

The presence in the population of a large number of individuals unprotected by vaccination, will, I am afraid, lead to a rise in the smallpox mortality. Measles, including both intra-parochial and extra-parochial leaths were 61, giving a measles death-rate of 0.92 per thousand as against 0.68 per thousand for London as a whole. The presence of measles epidemics seem to be a normal condition of the district, at any rate, for the past three years, we appear never to have been free from the disease. During 1898 we had an epidemic at one time in the North, and again in the South and Central districts. Perhaps, with a large juvenile population, this is not to be wondered at, but the cost to infant life is extremely great, and probably calls for greater efforts to deal with the disease. Scarlet fever caused no deaths in the district, but 13 occurred amongst the patients treated in external hospitals. This gives a death rate of 0.19 per thousand, that for London as a whole being only 0.13 per thousand. As has been noticed in recent years the mortality continues very low. Diphtheria caused during the year 10 deaths in the district, and 26 deaths also occurred among the cases removed for treatment, making a total of 36, and giving a death-rate of 0.54 per thousand. It is gratifying to be able to report a decided improvement upon the mortality of last year, which was 0.7 per thousand, Clerkenwell holding the unenviable position of having, with the exception of Woolwich, the highest diphtheria deathrate amongst the London Districts. Its position is now altered from 2nd to 9th of the highest districts. Much good has resulted from the energetic measures taken last year. Recognizing that Clerkenwell was peculiar in having a large number of houses which, originally built for one family, were now inhabited by several, and as a consequence are ill-adapted for home nursing of diphtheria, a special effort was made to have cases removed for treatment, and the number of cases treated at home in unsuitable 147 houses is considerably diminished. The action of the Vestry in providing for a bacteriological examination leading to more rapid and reliable diagnosis has been of great advantage to Medical Practitioners in cases of doubtful diphtheria. The following are the death rates from diphtheria for the past ten years :— 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 .36 .28 .42 .42 1.15 .51 .51 .62 .7 54 Diarrhoea, including cases of gastro-enteritis, caused 134 deaths, equal to a death-rate of 2.02 per 1,000, This extremely high death-rate from diarrhoea after the efforts which have been made during the past year to diminish the mortality is somewhat disappointing. The improvement in the removal of house refuse and prevention of soil pollution in the neighbourhood of houses is certainly important work, and must be steadily continued. It must not be forgotton that last year was exceptionally unfavourable, as a dry, hot summer is invariably associated with a high diarrhoea mortality, and the rise has been general throughout the country. The effect of unsound food in causing intestintal disease is well known, and during the year a most important action for the protection of infant life has been carried out. We had noticed upon the inspection of the premises of a large wholesale condensed milk merchant an accumulation of returned blown tins, showing that decomposition of the contents had taken place. The labels of these tins were removed and a statement was made that they were sold for pig-feeding only. It seemed to us that no special effort was made to prevent them being, and it was probable that in some cases they would be, placed upon the market. We therefore obtained the names and addresses of the buyers, and communication was made to the Medical Officer of Health of each particular district asking that a watch might be kept upon these goods. In the course of time some condensed milk was discovered in our own district which had been sold by a man named Fells, given as a purchaser of this unsound 148 food. In company with Inspector Bartlett I visited the premises situated in Limehouse and induced the Authorities to visit and seize the articles in question. A very large number of tins of unsound food of various sorts were seized and destroyed, and a prosecution instituted. In the case of condensed milk sold in our own district a prosecution resulted in a sentence of six months hard labour, the Magistrate commenting strongly on the case, and we had the satisfaction of practically putting an end (at least for the time being) to a dangerous and most objectionable trade. Enteric fever caused two deaths in the district, and five deaths occurred among the cases removed for treatment, giving a total of seven deaths and a death-rate of .11 per 1,000. For London as a whole the death-rate is .12 per 1,000. Whooping cough has caused 34 deaths, all occurring in the district, giving a death-rate of .51 per 1,000, the rate for London as a whole being .48. One-hundred-and-forty nine deaths were due to phthisis, giving a death-rate of 2.25 per thousand. Athough in common with all the central districts of London our phthisis death-rate is high, the rate for London as a whole being only 1.72 per thousand, Clerkenwell compares favourably with other districts having a population living under similar conditions. The phthisis death-rate for St. Luke's is 2.74 per thousand, Holborn 3.17, Strand 3.32, and St. Giles 3.34. The fact that phthisis is an infectious disease, due to the growth in the human body of the bacillus tuberculosis, has been fully demonstrated and well known for several years past. It has not however been generally appreciated or popularly known. An effort has been made on the part of several well-known physicians to disseminate the information, and the movement has become general and widespread. By the action of public bodies and philanthropic individuals, Sanitoria for the open air treatment of phthisis are being established in increasing numbers, 149 and an effort is being made to impress upon the public that though in an advanced stage the disease may be hopeless, yet early treatment is distinctly hopeful and encouraging. Phthisis is a disease of adult life. The victim often beirg the head of the family, the misery and suffering involved is intensified by the bread-winner being laid aside, and I would ask the Board to assist the movement by providing facilities for bacteriological examinations in a similar way to what we already do in the case of diphtheria and typhoid fever. The treatment of phthisis as an infectious disease involving isolation and disinfection is perhaps at present inadvisable. Public opinion must be interested in the subject before such steps can be successful, but nothing but good can result from a knowledge of the danger incurred and preventive measures which may be taken. We might well arrange for the disinfection of clothing and houses in cases of phthisis where such is desired by parishioners. An impetus will be given by the movement to increased attention being paid to air space and the overcrowding of dwellings. The deaths of infants, under one year, occurring in the parish were 357 against 342 for the previous year. One-hundred-and-fifty inquests were held in the year and during the previous year there were 151. Cowhouses.— The number of cowhouses and slaughterhouses in the district, now extremely few, were duly inspected on two occasions and found in a generally satisfactory condition. Bakehouses.- The bakehouses were inspected at intervals during the year, an effort being made to establish a higher standard of cleanliness. It was necessary to take legal proceedings, and a conviction was obtained in six cases—two in each Inspector's district. For the future this higher standard will be insisted upon. Disinfecting Apparatus.— Disinfection by steam has been steadily continued during the year. The steam disinfector of Goddard, Massey & Warner, has given general satisfaction. 150 borne complaints were made of stains on linen, etc., and a number of experiments were made, but it was found that sheets and all light coloured articles stained with orange juice, milk etc., not noticeable before being treated with steam, became markedly apparent after disinfection. We had some little trouble in meeting claims, but it was pointed out that such staining was unavoidable and that compensation could only be allowed in cases of careless and unnecessary damage. Houses Let in Lodgings.— Satisfactory progress has been made with the work of placing suitable houses on the register. At the beginning of the year 1899 the number was 187. Appointment of Sanitary Inspector.— The appointment of a Sanitary Inspector, whose duty it would be to attend to registered houses, factories and workshops, was under discussion. The necessity for such an appointment was generally admitted, but reasonable objection was taken to such a step while matters were in an unsettled condition, amalgamation with other districts being generally anticipated. Insanitary Areas. — A commencement was made with the work of dealing with insanitary areas in the district, and an official representation with respect to Jerusalem Court, Bishop's Court, Aylesbury Place, a part of St. John Street, Albemarle Street, Aylesbury Street, and Jerusalem Passage, was made to the London County Council, under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. The representation was considered by the Council who forwarded a reply that though agreeing with the representation it was not of sufficient Metropolitan importance to justify action being taken under Part I. of the Act, but recommending that a scheme under Part II. should be instituted. The matter was then referred to the Home Secretary for Arbitration, who appointed Mr. H. D. Steward, Arbitrator. The Yestry then wrote for a delay of three months to enable them to prepare their case. In the meantime, recognizing the difficulties 151 in the way of re-housing, the Council had passed a resolution that in future all cases involving re-housing should be undertaken by them. Upon this, a communication was forwarded to the Council stating that the Vestry presumed the Arbitration would be unnecessary and would therefore be abandoned. After negotiations and considerable delay intimation was received that the insanitary area was, or at least the chief parts of it were, accepted by the Council and would be dealt with by them.

VESTRY OF THE Parish of St. James and John, CLERKENWELL SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875. REPORTS OF Mr. J. K. COLWELL, F.I.C., F.C.S., Public Analyst, AND INSPECTORS. 1898-9. 164 Analyst's Report. Clerkenwell Town Hall, Rosebery Avenue, E.C., 20th June, 1899. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, during the year ending the 31st March, 1899. The total number of samples of food and drugs examined during the period was 299, a slightly smaller number than in the preceding year. The totals for the previous eight years are as follows:— Year. No. of Samples Examined. 1890-91 144 1891-92 149 1892-93 184 1893-94 185 1894-95 177 1895-96 228 1896-97 311 1897-98 304 Of these 299 samples, 296 were submitted for analysis by the Vestry's Inspectors, Messrs. Bartlett (96), Elisor (100), and Green (100), and 3 by private purchasers. 165 In the following table will be found a statement of the articles examined during each quarter of the year:— Name of Article. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Qarter. 4th Quarter.

The figures for the preceding eight years, are as follows:— Year. Percentage of Adulterated Samples. 1800-91 29.8 1891-92 22.1 1892-93 17.9 1893-94 23.7 1894-95 16.4 1895-96 23.2 1896-97 22.1 1897-98 13.8 MILK. A large number of samples of milk have again been submitted for examination. Of the 108 samples analysed 33 (32.03 per cent.) were found to be adulterated. Ten of the samples classed as "not adulterated" were of very poor quality. In view of these facts the milk supply of the parish cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The nature and amount of adulteration in each case were as follows:— No. of Sample Nature and Amount of Adulteration. FIRST QUARTER (ending 30th June, 1898.) C 3 26 At least 10.0 per cent, of fat removed. C 3 2 „ 11.3 „ „ C 3 6 „ 12.0 „ „ 20 „ 16.0 „ „ 23 At least 8.0 per cent, of water added. 17 „ 13.1 „ „ 167 No.of Sample Nature and Amount of Adulteration.

The amount of fat removed varied from 8.0 to 32.6 per cent., and the quantity of water added from 3.4 to 29.4 per cent., while in three cases both fat had been removed and water added. 168 Ten samples of milk were taken on a Sunday in December— two were found to be adulterated by the addition of water. BUTTER. Seven (12.06 per cent.) of the samples of butter were found to contain foreign fat (fat other than the fat of butter), as follows:- No. of Sample Nature and Amount of Adulteration. C 3 18 At least 80.0 per cent, of foreign fat. C 2 30 „ 80.0 „ „ 51 „ 80 0 „ „ 64 „ 80.0 „ „ 81 „ 70.0 „ „ Private Purchaser (9) „ 80.0 „ „ Private Purchaser (66) „ 70.0 „ „ Two of the samples were submitted by a private purchaser, and were both adulterated. WHISKY. Three of the 29 samples of whisky were unduly diluted with water, so as to bring them slightly in excess of the limit allowed by the Act of Parliament, 25 degrees finder proof. C 2 18 26.07 degrees under proof. C 2 70 26.04 „ „ 65 26.06 „ „ MUSTARD. One sample ot mustard (No. 53) had been mixed with at least 15 per cent, of starch and farinaceous substances, and was certified accordingly. 169 DEMERARA SUGAR. Of the 5 samples submitted, two were undoubtedly not samples of demerara sugar, and were found to consist of white crystals, colored to represent demerara sugar with an organic dye. SPIRIT OF NITROUS ETHER. In the one sample of this article taken the principal ingredient was found to be deficient in quantity to the extent of at least 49.7 per cent. ICE CREAM. The samples of ice cream examined afforded marked evidence that the great improvement which has taken place during the last year or two in the preparation and preservation of these delicacies in this district has been fully maintained. COCOA, COFFEE, &c. The remaining samples were certified to be "not adulterated." THE NEW SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS BILL. Before another annual report is issued another Act of Parliament will probably have been added to the list of those dealing with the purity of Food whether the beneficial results anticipated will be realised, remains to be seen.

Gentlemen, This Report, which we have the pleasure to present to the Vestry, covers the period from January ist, 1898, to March, 31st, 1899, and represents nine months working under the late Board of Library Commissioners, and six months under the Library Committee of the Vestry. The chief event has been the transfer of the powers of the Commissioners to the Vestry, which took place on September 29th, 1898, under an order of the Local Government Board. Stock.—The additions during the fifteen months numbered 1382 volumes, of which 317 were placed in the Reference, and 1065 in the Lending department, making the totals 5246 and 13,010, respectively. Their classification is as follows:— Science and Art 3076 Social Science and Theology 1561 History, Travel, Biography 4052 Language and Literature 468 Poetry and Drama 747 Prose Fiction and Juvenile 6057 Miscellaneous 2295 Total Stock 18.256 315 volumes were purchased to replace worn-out copies, and 32 books found in infected houses by the Medical Officer of Health were destroyed. Book Issues and Readers.—The total number of volumes issued was 150,124, of which 19,932 were for Reference; 128,334 for home reading, and 1,858 were issued on Sundays. These were classified as follows:— Science and Art 14057 Social Science and Theology 3637 History, Travel, Biography 13596 Language and Literature I531 Poetry and Drama. 1397 Prose Fiction and Juvenile 105185 Miscellaneous 10721 Total issues 150,124 6 This forms a daily average, excluding Sunday and Juvenile issues of 382, as against 428 in 1897. Of Adult Borrowers (from 16 years of age and upward), there are now 3,214, representing every class of the community. Of these, 359 also hold Student's Tickets, by which an extra non-fictional work can be withdrawn for home-reading. Juvenile Room.—In April, 1898, the late Commissioners adapted the basement of the Library as a Reading Room for Boys and Girls and transferred to it the whole of the Juvenile books from the Lending Department. The age limit at which children could use the Library was reduced from twelve toeight years of age, and the result was a very large addition to the number of juveniles using the Department. Tickets to the number of 2093, entitling the holders to use the Juvenile Reading Room were issued, and there are also 982 tickets in use, which enable books to be withdrawn from the Library for homereading. Over 200 appropriate books are placed 011 open shelves for the free use of the children and, in addition, a selection of suitable magazines is provided. During the period from April 12th, 1S98, to March 31st, 1899, 13,918 volumes have been issued for home reading, besides which, it is estimated that 43,000 visits have been made for the purpose of reading books and magazines on the premises. The overcrowding, which occurred when the Department was first opened, gradually diminished as the novelty wore off, and now the room is chiefly used by the more studious boys and girls. The Committee desire to express their gratification at the success of the experiment. Sundays.—The Reading Room alone is open on Sundays from 3 to 9 p.m., and the total attendance during the fifteen months was 8,300, a daily average of 129; while the number of books issued was 1,858; a daily average of 29, as against an average of 161 and 40 respectively, in 1897. Reading Rooms.—The News-room maintained its great popularity during the period under review, and it is estimated that 547,690 visits were made, a daily average of 1,430. The attendance in this department and the limited space available for the display of newspapers and periodicals, make the necessity of securing increased accommodation somewhat 7 urgent. We are afraid, however, that it is not possible to provide more room in the present building. The question of providing library accommodation, both at Muswell Hill and Pentonville, has been considered by the Committee, but was adjourned in view of the changes likely to occur under the provisions of the London Government Bill. The Reference Reading Room also continues to be well-used and appreciated, the total visits being estimated at 176,180 for the fifteen months, a daily average of 460. The number of lady readers has increased. Worn Out Books and Out of Date Magazines.—It was decided to offer these to the Guardians of the Holborn Union for the use of the inmates of the various institutions, an offer which that Board gladly accepted We trust that they may be of service in solacing the declining days of the poor people in those places. Lighting.—The Committee have given consideration to the unsatisfactory lighting of some parts of the Library, and hope to be able soon to introduce great improvements in every department. Obituary.—The Library sustained a severe loss in the sudden and widely lamented death of the Rev. John H. Rose, M.A., Vicar of Clerkenwell, and Chairman of the Library Commissioners from 1888 to 1897, which took place in April, i8q8. He was early identified with the movement which resulted in the adoption of the Public Libraries Acts by Clerkenwell in 1887, and remained a warm and consistent friend and supporter of the Public Library till the day of his death. He took a keen interest in the work and progress of the Library from the beginning, and supported every proposal for its improvement. The Committee have also to express their regret for the loss of Mr. George Wright, whose sudden death in March last was greatly felt by his colleagues. He had only been a member of the Committee since September, 1898. Miscellaneous.—The favour and esteem in which the Library is held is not confined to Clerkenwell. The system of open access to the shelves, which enables the borrower 8 to make his own selection direct from the shelves, in the same manner in which a private person may go to his own bookcase, has made our Library famous throughout the world. Letters, inquiring as to the working of this arrangement, arrive from all quarters. Gratifying tributes of this kind have been received from Melbourne, Denmark, Germany, South Africa, and the United States. Similar enquiries have been received from many English public libraries, while deputations and librarians from Country and foreign libraries constantly call to study the working ol the system. In view of the confusing statements which have recently appeared in the press, the Committee take this opportunity of explaining that the open access system, as worked at Clerkenwell, is thoroughly safe-guarded against misplacements or disorder, that the losses are trilling, and that there is only a resemblance in name between the Clerkenwell system and that of some other libraries, which have been reported as failures, or as having suffered heavy losses. The third section of the catalogue, Class-guide to the Books on Science, Fine, Recreative, and Useful Arts, was published early in 1898, and the Quarterly Guide for Readers has been issued regularly every quarter as before.
