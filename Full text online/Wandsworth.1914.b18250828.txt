the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1914. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlehen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1914. Population. The population of the Borough to the middle of 1914 has been estimated by the Registrar-General to be 338,998, but in mv opinion this estimate is too high, as judging by the increase in the number of rated hereditaments the rate of increase during the present decennium is not so great as in the previous one. During the decennium 1901-1911 the increase in the number of rated hereditaments was 23,243, or an average of 2,324 per annum. From the returns furnished by the Rating Department the increase in the number of rated hereditaments in the year 1914 was only 521 and 917 in 1913, so that the increase in population will be considerably less than in the previous decennium. Table I. shows the Census population in 1911 in each Ward, the number of rated hereditaments and the number of persons per rated hereditament in 1911, the rated hereditaments in 1914, and the population estimated from the same. To this has been added the natural increase, i.e., the difference between the number of births and the number of deaths in 1911-12, 1912-13, and 1913-14. 2 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Whole Borough 92,376 311,360 95,133 326,945 98,046 332,147 3 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The corrected population in Table II. is used to calculate all the rates in this Report. The total population of the Institutions in the Borough was in 1911, 7,855, but as a large proportion of the inmates of the Tooting Home and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital belong to the Borough, a deduction of 3,202 from the uncorrected population gives the corrected population, viz.:â€”326,945, compared with 321,340 in the previous year. Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 2nd January, 1915, 6,684 births, 3,444 of males and 3,240 of females, were registered, compared with 6,838 in 1913, 6,756 in 1912, and 6,699 in 1911. The total number of births registered in this Borough was 6,590, but 149 births occurred in Institutions outside the Borough of persons belonging to the Borough, and 55 births in Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging to the Borough, making a corrected total of 6,684. Of the 149 births which were registered outside the Borough, 61 occurred in Clapham Maternity, 30 in the General Lying-in Hospital, 15 in Queen Charlotte's Hospital, 19 in St. Thomas's Hospital, two in City of London Lying-in Hospital, two in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, one in Middlesex Hospital, one in the Bolingbroke Hospital, six in Poor Law Infirmaries, 11 in private nursing homes, and one in other place. In Table III. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each sub-district, and for the whole Borough. 4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The rate for the whole Borough is the lowest yet recorded, being .43 under the rate for the previous year, and 3 86 under the decennial average. Compared with 1913 the rate in the several sub-districts show a decrease in all with the exception of Streatham, where there has been an increase of .55 per 1,000. Compared with the decennial average there has been a decrease in all the sub-districts, and this is exceptionally large in Tooting where the reduction has been from 33.80 to 25.57 per 1,000. The birth-rate for the whole of London was 24.3 per 1,000, compared with 24.8 in 1913, and 26.33 the decennial average; while for England and Wales the rate was 23.8 per 1,000, compared with 23.9 in 1913, and 25.87 the decennial average. 119 births occurred in the Workhouse, and of these three belonged to Clapham, nine to Putney, 16 to Streatham, nine to Tooting, 27 to Wandsworth, 47 to Battersea, and eight to other places. Of these 119 births, 79 were illegitimate, two belonging to Clapham, six to Putney, 12 to Streatham, seven to Tooting, 17 to Wandsworth, 28 to Battersea, and seven to other places. In the Borough, excluding the Workhouse, 209 illegitimate births occurred, 26 in Clapham, 14 in Putney, 102 in Streatham, 29 in Tooting, and 38 in Wandsworth. 61 of the illegitimate births in Streatham occurred at a private home in the sub-district. Of the births registered outside the Borough 35, 25 of males and 10 of females, were illegitimate. The total number of illegitimate births was 288, 39 of which belonged to Clapham, 23 to Putney, 123 to Streatham, 44 to Tooting, and 59 to Wandsworth, compared with 283 in 1913, 223 in 1912, and 180 in 1911. 6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The percentage of illegitimate births to total births was 4.30 compared with 4.13 in 1913, 3.30 in 1912 and 2.68 in 1911, and 4.30 for England and Wales for 1912. The following Table shows the percentage of illegitimate births to total births for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year, and for the three previous years Sub-district. 1911 1912 1913 1914 Clapham 2.6o 3.71 3.17 3.23 Putney 3.32 3.27 5 .47 4.91 Streatham 2.15 2.59 4.55 6.39 Tooting 3.20 34.0 4.14 4.57 Wandsworth 2.81 3.7 4.04 2.77 Whole Borough 268 33Â° 413 43Â° Notification of Births Act.

The increase in the percentage of births notified to those registered was due to the fact that parents were written to when a birth was registered informing them that the birth ought to have been notified. In the sub-districts these percentages were: In Clapham 97.1 and 2.9, compared with 76.0 and 24.0 in 1913; in Putney 95.8 and 4.2 compared with 70.9 and 29.1; in Streathan 90.2 and 9.8, compared with 56.2 and 43.8; in Tooting 95.5 and 4.5 compared with 56.7 and 43.2; and in Wandsworth 97.7 and 2.3. compared with 86.5 and 13.5. An increase has taken place in all the subdistricts. The proportion of still-births to total births notified was 19 per cent., compared with 2.3 per cent, in 1913, and 2.5 per cent., the mean for the whole of London for the year 1913. The work carried out by the female Sanitary Inspectors in connection with the Notification of Births Act is given later on in this Report when dealing with Infantile Mortality. Deaths. During the 52 weeks ending the 2nd January, 1915, 3,332 deaths, 1,590 of males and 1,742 of females were registered, compared with 3,344 in 1913, 3,118 in 1912, and 3,456 in 1911. Compared with 1913 there has been a decrease of 12 deaths, and of 359 compared with the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The uncorrected death-rate for the Borough was 10.02 per 1,000, compared with 10.04 in 1913, 9.78 in 1912 and 1102 in 1911. The average uncorrected rate for the decennium 1904-1913 was 11.22 or 1.20 above the rate for the year 1914. 9 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the sub-districts these rates were as follows :â€”8.75 in Clapham, 9.26 in Putney, 8.29 in Streatham, 21.24 in Tooting, and 8.36 in Wandsworth. The reason for the high rate in Tooting is that in that subdistrict there are a number of Public Institutions, as the Tooting Bee Asylum and the Tooting Home, where persons from other parts of London are received and among whom the mortality is very great. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in Out-lying Institutions and other places of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in Public Institutions and other places in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domiciles were in other parts of London. The deaths occurring in other parts of England and Wales axe also included, as these are now received from the Registrar General. The total number of deaths for the 52 weeks, corrected for both internal and external Institutions and other places was 3,664, compared with 3,588 in 1913, 3,291 in 1912, 3,776 in 1911, and 3,884, the decennial average corrected for increase of population. During the year 854 deaths occurred in Public Institutions and 164 in other places in the Borough. Of the total of 1,018 deaths, 824 were of persons not belonging and 194 of persons belonging to the Borough. Table VII. shows the total number of Institution deaths arranged according to sub-districts and Institutions in which they occurred, Table VIII. the deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough, and Table IX. the deaths of persons belonging thereto arranged according to causes of death, sex and age, and Institution in which the death occurred. 10 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of deaths in out-lying Institutions was 1,155, 621 of males and 534 of females, compared with 1,066 in 1913, 940 in 1912, and 989 in 1911. 600 of these deaths occurred in Workhouses and Workhouse Infirmaries, compared with 500 in 1913; 425 in General and Special Hospitals, compared with 425 in 1913; 113 in Public Lunatic or Imbecile Asylums, compared with 105 in 1913; and 17 in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, compared with 36 in 1913. The hospitals, asylums, etc., in which these deaths occurred are shown in detail on Table LXXXVII., on page 164. The corrected number of deaths, after adding the deaths of persons belonging to the Borough, and subtracting those of persons dying in the Borough and not belonging thereto, was 3,664, 1,794 of males, and 1,870 of females, an increase of 76 compared with 1913, but a decrease of 242 compared with the corrected decennial average. The corrected death-rate for the year was 11 -20 compared with 10.95 in 1913, 10.48 in 1912, 12.25 in 1911 and 11.96 the rate for the 10 years 1904-1913. Table XI. shows the total number of deaths and the deathrates for each sub-district and for the whole Borough, corrected and uncorrected for deaths in Public Institutions. The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 14.4 per 1,000, compared with 14.2 in 1913, 13.96 in 1912, 15.8 in 1911, and 15.04 the decennial average.

The death-rate in England and Wales in 1914 was 137 per 1,000, compared with 13.7 in 1913, 13.3 in 1912, 14.6 in 1911 ; in the 97 Great Towns 15.0 compared with 14.3 in 19x3, 13.8 in 1912, and 16.4 in 1911 ; and in the 145 Smaller Towns 13.1 compared with 12.8, 12.4 and 14.4. If a comparison is to be made with other places it is necessary to again correct the corrected rate, viz. 11.20, for age and sex distribution. This is done by multiplying the rate by a factor obtained by dividing the standard death-rate in England and Wales at the Census of 1911, with the standard death-rate for the Borough at the same period. This factor has been ascertained to be 1-0045 which gives a rate for this Borough for the year 1914 of 11.24 Per 1,000, compared with 10.99 in 1913, 11.03 in 1912,and 12.92 in 1911. The following Table shows the factor for correction, the crude death-rate, the corrected death-rate, and the comparative mortality figure for London and for the 29 Boroughs, including the City of London, for the year 1914. The figures are extracted from the quarterly returns of the Registrar-General for the year, and are completely corrected as between individual Metropolitan Boroughs. The rate in Wandsworth is also corrected for the whole of England and Wales. The Table is, this year, therefore, only approximately correct, but gives a fairly exact estimate of the rates for the year. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 19 TABLE XII. AREA.

In the separate sub-districts of the Borough the corrected death-rate was 10.74 in Putney, 10.95 in Tooting, 11.22 in Clapham, 11.27 in Wandsworth, and 11.35 in Streatham. The rates in all the sub-districts were higher than in 1913, with the exception of Wandsworth which was lower, and was due to causes which will be commented on in another part of this Report. Table XIII. shows the death-rate in the Borough, in the five sub-districts, and in England and Wales for the year, as well as the rates for the previous 10 years, compared with the decennial average. During the previous decennium the lowest mortality in the Borough and in London was in 1910, while it was lowest in England and Wales in the year 1912. The rate in 1914, although higher than in 1910, 1912 and 1913 is in all the sub-districts, with the exception of Streatham, considerably lower than the average of the previous 10 years. Compared with London and with England and Wales the Borough rate is considerably lower. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 21 TABLE XIII. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth.

The first Chart shows the death-rate in the Borough for each fortnight, compared with the quinquennial average 1909-1913. The Chart shows that on 13 fortnights the rate was above that for the previous quinquennium. During the rest of the year the fortnightly rate was under the quinquennial rate. The highest rate, viz.:â€”14.4, occurred during the fortnight ending the 17th January and this was due to the great number of deaths from Respiratory diseases ; and the lowest rate during the fortnight ending the 18th July, when it was 7.1 per 1,000. The next Chart shows the Annual Death-rate per 1,000 during each week of the year for the whole of London and for each fortnight for the Borough of Wandsworth. During the year the rate in each fortnight in this Borough was under the rate for the whole of London. The highest rate in London was in the week ending the 2nd January, 1915, and the lowest in the fourth week of July. Table XIV. shows the vital statistics of the whole Borough for the year and for the previous 10 years, as well as the average for the 10 years. This Table shows clearly the variations in the births and deaths, the birth and death-rates, and the infantile mortality for the decennium, compared with the year 1914. Compared with the decennial average there has been a considerable decrease in the birth-rate, and a decrease in the deathrate, while the infantile mortality also shows a most satisfactory decrease, although this latter is not so low as it was in 1910 and 1912. It will also be seen that there has been an increase of 323 deaths of residents outside the Borough, compared with the 10 years' average. The corrected death-rate, although somewhat higher than it was in 1910 1912 and 1913, is still under the 10 years' average.

Compared with 1913 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, Cancer and diseases of the Circulatory organs and Urinary system, and these increases are the cause of the death-rate for the year having been higher than in 1913. From Pulmonary Tuberculosis there has been a slight decrease, and this is also the case as regards Old Age and Premature Birth. The deaths from Suicide have decreased from 33 in 1913 to 22 in 1914, but the deaths from accident have increased from 80 in 1913 to 86 in 1914. The four Tables which follow are inserted by request of the Local Government Board. Table I. is arranged to show the gross births and deaths in the district, and the births and deaths belonging to it with the corresponding rates. The rates in column 7 are calculated on the gross population and the rates in 5 and 13 on the nett population, i.e., the population obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number of inmates not belonging to the district in Public Institutions. The population given in column two of this Table is the population after the above correction has been made. Table II. shows the number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the separate sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed to hospital from the whole Borough. 26 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Table III. is the general mortality Table for the whole Borough showing the number of deaths at all ages, and at certain ages, arranged as to cause of death. It also shows the number of deaths in Public Institutions and other places in the district, both of residents and non-residents. Table IV. shows in detail the deaths of infants under one year of age from certain diseases, arranged in weekly age periods, the first four weeks, from one to three months, and for three monthly periods up to one year.

The following Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths at six age periods for each sub-district and for the whole Borough. TABLE XX. Sub-Districts.

There was a considerable diversity in these rates in the different sub-districts. In Putney the rate under one year was only 13.10 while in Tooting it was 26.70 ; while over 65 years of age Tooting had a rate of 19.91 and Streatham of 39.77. At one and under five years the rate was lowest in Putney and highest in Tooting, from five and under 15 years lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, at 15 and under 25 years lowest in Putney and highest in Tooting, at 25 and under 65 years lowest in Tooting and highest in Clapham, and at 65 years and upwards lowest in Tooting and highest in Streatham. 32 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. These differences are due to the differences in the age constitution of the population in the separate sub-districts, as well as the difference in social conditions. The increase in the percentage of deaths under one year and from one and under five years was due to the increase in the number of deaths from Measles, Diarrhcea and Enteritis. Infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants under one year was 589, compared with 605 in 1913, 516 in 1912, and 823 in 1911, and is 216 under the decennial average corrected for increase of population. Of these, 92 occurred in Clapham, 41 in Putney, 167 in Streatham, 110 in Tooting, and 179 in Wandsworth. The infantile mortality or deaths under one year to 1,000 births, was 88 compared with 88 in 1913, 76 in 1912, and 122 in 1911. This rate was 76 in Clapham, compared with 96 the decennial average ; 87 in Putney, compared with 85 ; 86 in Streatham, compared with 85 ; 114 in Tooting, compared with 123 ; and 84 in Wandsworth, compared with 108. In the whole Borough the rate was the same as that for 1913, but 13 under the decennial average. In all the sub-districts, there has been a decrease in this rate compared with the decennial average, this decrease having been greatest in Clapham and Wandsworth. In Tooting the rate was higher than in any of the other sub-districts, but was nine under the decennial average. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 33 The following Table shows the number of deaths, the percentage to total deaths, the rate per 1,000 births for the year and for the three previous years for each sub-district and for the whole Borough.

The total number of births was 6,684 of which 6,396 were legitimate and 288 illegitimate, and of deaths 589, of which 514 were legitimate and 75 illegitimate. From the notifiable infective diseases three deaths occurred during the year, one from Scarlet Fever in Wandsworth, and two from Erysipelas, one in Clapham and one in Wandsworth, 35 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From Measles there were seven deaths, a considerable decrease compared with the previous year. From Whooping Cough there were 24 deaths, from DiarrhÅ“al diseases 136, from Premature Birth 115, from other diseases of infancy 128, from Tuberculous diseases 10, from diseases of the Respiratory Organs 88, from Convulsions 21, from Syphilis nine, from Suffocation (overlying) five, and from other causes 43. Compared with 1913 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Whooping Cough, Premature Birth, and other diseases of infancy, but a decrease in the number from Measles and diseases of the Respiratory Organs. In all the deaths, with three exceptions, one in Clapham, one in Streatham, and one in Tooting, the cause of death was certified by a medical man, or by a coroner after inquest. 38.0 per cent, of the deaths occurred in the first month, compared with 377 in 1913, 4 47 in 1912, and 29 5 in 1911; 55.0 in the first three months, compared with 56 0, 65 3, and 43.7 ; and 75.7 in the first six months, compared with 74.2, 80.6, and 65.9. The Table shows that 115 died from Premature Birth, of which 106 occurred under one month, and 111 from Congenital Debility and Malformations, compared with 113 in 1913, 103 in 1912, and 146 in 1911. Of the total deaths under one month, viz. :â€”224, 106 occurred from Premature Birth and 61 from Congenital Debility and Malformations, a percentage of 74 5 compared with 74.5 in 1913. From Diarrhoeal diseases only six deaths occurred under one month. The greatest mortality from these diseases occurred at four weeks to three months and three to six months. 36 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. From Tuberculous diseases 10 deaths occurred ; six from Tuberculous Meningitis, and four from other Tuberculous diseases, compared with five in 1913, and eight in 1912 ; and 88 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, compared with 121. Eight deaths were registered as due to Meningitis, but enquiries of the medical attendant showed that all these were due to simple Meningitis. Table XXIII. shows the proportion of deaths per 1,000 births from five groups of diseases for each week under one month, from one to three months and for each three months up to one year of age. Compared with 1913, the rate from Diarrhoeal diseases was slightly higher, the rate having been 20 26 per 1,000 compared with 19.27 in 1913. From Premature Birth, Congenital Debility and Malformations the rate was higher than in 1913, and this was also the case from Tuberculous diseases, while from other causes the rate was slightly lower. From the Table it will be seen that the rate from common infective diseases was highest at the ages six to nine months, from Diarrhoeal diseases at three to six months, from Premature Birth, etc., under one month, from Tuberculous diseases at three to six and six to nine months, and from other causes at three to six months.

Compared with 1913 there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Tuberculous diseases, 40 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Erysipelas, Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea and other infective diseases, and a decrease in the number of deaths from Puerperal Fever, Measles, and Influenza, while the number of deaths from Enteric Fever is the same. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Diphtheria, Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas, and other infective diseases, but a decrease in all the others. From all infective diseases the death-rate was 2.21 per 1,000, (2.32 in Clapham, 1.85 in Putney, 2.20 in Streatham, 3.35 in Tooting, and 2.85 in Wandsworth), compared with 2.43 in 1913, and 3.44 the decennial average. The rate from the principal infective diseases, viz.:â€”Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhoea, was 99 per 1,000 (.79 in Clapham, 72 in Putney, 75 in Streatham, 1.70 in Tooting, and 1.17 in Wandsworth), compared with 1.04 in 1913, 1.73 in 1912, and 2.26 in 1911. The rate from these diseases was lower than in 1913 owing to the decrease in the number of deaths from Measles, Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea. In out-lying Institutions 310 deaths occurred from infective diseases (50 belonging to Clapham, 15 to Putney, 83 to Streatham, 54 to Tooting, and 108 to Wandsworth), compared with 281 in 1913. Of these deaths 178 occurred in Workhouse Infirmaries, 101 in General and Special Hospitals, 18 in Public Lunatic Asylums, and 13 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The causes of death in these Institutions is shown in Table X. In Institutions in the Borough 167 deaths from infective diseases occurred of persons not belonging thereto, compared with 183 in 1913. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 41 Of these deaths 76 occurred in the Fever Hospital, 21 from Scarlet Fever, 43 from Diphtheria, six from Whooping Cough, five from Tuberculous diseases, and one from Diarrhoea. 24 deaths from these diseases occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum, 21 from Tuberculous diseases, one from other infective diseases, and one from Diarrhoea; nine in the Tooting Bee Asylum, seven from Tuberculous diseases, one from Erysipelas, and one from other infective diseases; 17 in the Hostel of God, all from Tuberculous diseases; 12 in the Tooting Home, all from Tuberculous diseases; one in the Royal Hospital for Incurables from Tuberculous disease; 14 in the Fountain Asylum, 13 from Tuberculous diseases, and one from Whooping Cough; one in St. Anne's Home from Tuberculous disease; two in Putney Hospital from Tuberculous diseases; and one in Newland's House from Tuberculous disease. In other places not Institutions 10 deaths occurred, six from Tuberculous diseases, two from Enteric Fever and two from Influenza. In Institutions in the Borough 60 deaths from infective diseases occurred of persons belonging thereto, 45 in the Fever Hospital at Tooting, six from Scarlet Fever, five from Enteric Fever, 26 from Diphtheria, two from Whooping Cough, three from Puerperal Fever, two from Tuberculous diseases, and one from other infective diseases; six in the Tooting Home, all from Tuberculous diseases; two in the Putney Hospital, one from Tuberculous disease, and one from other infective diseases; three in the Hostel of God, from Tuberculous diseases and one in other place from Measles. Compared with 1913 this shows a decrease of 27. The next Tables shows the death rates from these diseases for the whole Borough and for each sub-district for the year 1914, as well as for the preceding 10 years, and the rates above or below the decennial average are also shown. 42 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Puerperal Fever, and Polio-Myelitis; and a decrease in the number of cases of Enteric Fever, Erysipelas, and Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. 45 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of cases notified was 2,338, (327 in Clapham, 214 in Putney, 523 in Streatham, 411 in Tooting, and 863 in Wandsworth), compared with 1,748 in 1913, 1,614 in 1912, and 1,949 in 1911. The next Table shows the rate per 1,000 persons living in the Borough, in the separate sub-districts, and for the whole of London for the year and for the previous ten years. In 1904 and 1911 Chicken-pox was compulsorily notifiable, and as a consequence the rates in these years are increased, especially, in 1914. 46 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXIX.

The greatest number of cases notified, viz.:-25, was received from the St. John's Infirmary, nine of these being Erysipelas, nine of Scarlet Fever, four of Ophthalmia Neonatorum, and three of Diphtheria. Of the 14 cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum notified, six were from the Royal Eye Hospital, and four from St. John's Infirmary. Vaccination. Table XXXI. is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Board of Guardians for the year 1913. It shows the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. Streatham, Balham and Tooting are included under the heading of Streatham.

This is again a decided decrease compared with the five previous years, and is much the lowest rate on record 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and in the vaccination sub-districts for the year 1913, as well as for the 10 years 1903-1912. The average for the 10 years is also shown on this Table. Compared with 1912 there has been a decrease in the percentage of successfully vaccinated in all the sub-districts. The greatest decrease occurred in Streatham, while in the whole Borough there has been a decrease of no less than 6.9 per cent. Compared with the decennial average there has been a decrease in all the sub-districts, the greatest decrease having been in Streatham, and the smallest in Putney. 374 infants died unvaccinated, a percentage of 5.7 compared with 6.3 in 1912, 8.8 in 1911 and 6.2 in 1910. Of the 3,216 infants remaining, 12 or .18 per cent. were stated to have been insusceptible of vaccination; 1,542 or 23.5 per cent. in respect of whom certificates of conscientious objection were received; 44 or .67 per cent. had vaccination postponed by medical certificate, leaving 593 or 9.0 per cent. as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for, compared with 12.8 in 1912, 11.4 in 1911, and 13.6 in 1910; while 1,025 or 15.6 per cent, remained on the books as unvaccinated, compared with 6.9 in 1913, 3.6 in 1911, and 3.3 in 1910. There has been a decrease of 3.8 in the percentage of cases removed, but an increase of 3.2 in the number of certificates of conscientious objections received, and of 8.7 in the number of cases remaining on the books as unvaccinated. It is to be specially noted that out of the total number of cases remaining on the books as unaccounted for, no less than 987 were in the Streatham Sub-District, while in the Putney Sub-District all the births were accounted for, 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Scarlet Fever. 1,417 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 971 in 1913, 833 in 1912, and 869 in 1911. 195 of these were in Clapham, 140 in Putney, 332 in Streatham, 250 in Tooting, and 500 in Wandsworth. 1,215 or 85 per cent, of these cases were removed to hospital where 11 died, and 202 or 15 per cent. were treated at home with two deaths. The total number of deaths was 13, of which two were in Clapham, one in Putney, four in Streatham, one in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth. The death-rate per 1,000 population was .03, compared with .03 in 1913. The percentage of cases removed to hospital, viz.:â€”85, is lower than in 1912 and 1913, but higher than in 1911 when it was 83. per cent. The case mortality was .91 per cent., compared with 1.13 in 1913, 1.32 in 1912, and 1.15 in 1911, and is the lowest yet recorded. The mortality among cases removed to hospital was .90 per cent., compared with 1.18 in 1913, and among those treated at home .99 per cent. compared with .80 in 1913. The mortality among the home-treated cases was thus higher than among those cases treated in hospital. The following Table shows the rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year, and the three previous years, as well as the corresponding rates for the whole of London. 54 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In Clapham the greatest number of cases was notified in January and November, and the smallest in September and October. In Putney the greatest number of cases was notified in November, in Streatham in February, in Tooting in October, and in Wandsworth in December. The rate in Tooting was to some extent raised by the notification of cases from the Fever Hospital. The total number of cases notified from this Institution was 34, so that the rate instead of being 6.11 would on that account be reduced to 5.74 in 1914, and 3.44 in 1913. In the whole Borough the greatest number of cases, viz.â€”168, was notified in November, and the smallest in August, viz.â€”71. 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each sub-district during each month of the year 1914 and for the whole year. TABLE XXXV. SubDistricts. January. February. March. April. May.

The next Table shows the number of cases of Scarlet Fever for each month of the year among children in attendance at elementary and other schools, for each sub-district, also the number for the whole Borough, the number of cases among persons not at school, the number attending schools outside the Borough, as well as the number of cases in which as far as could be ascertained, the diagnosis of Scarlet Fever was incorrect. Of the total number of cases, viz.â€”1,417, the diagnosis was incorrect in 57 or 4.0 per cent.; 797 or 56.2 per cent. were in attendance at schools in the Borough; 54 or 3.8 per cent. attended schools outside the Borough; while 509 or 35.9 per cent. did not attend school, being either over or under school age. 5& Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The percentage of children attending school in the Borough was as follows:â€”in Clapham, 124 out of 195, or 63 per cent.; in Putney, 76 out of 140, or 54 per cent.; in Streatham, 187 out of 332, or 56 per cent.; in Tooting, 125 out of 250, or 50 per cent.; and in Wandsworth, 285 out of 540, or 57 per cent. The percentage of cases in the Borough in attendance at school was higher than in 1913, while in the sub-districts the percentage was higher in all, with the exception of Tooting, where it was lower. The percentage in Tooting is calculated after deduction of the cases notified in Institutions in that sub-district. In Clapham the schools chiefly affected were Bonneville Road with 16 cases, Cavendish Road with 12 cases, and Larkhall Lane, Parochial, Old Town, and Telferscot Road with 11 cases each. In Putney, of the 76 cases, 39 were in attendance at Hotham Road, nine at All Saints', eight at St. Mary's, and 10 at private schools. In Streatham the schools chiefly affected were Oldridge Road with 26 cases, Eardley Road and Smallwood Road with 17 cases each, St. Mary's with 13 cases, and Hearnville Road and Holy Trinity with 10 cases each. 33 of the cases were in attendance at private schools, these chiefly occurring in March, May and December. In Tooting, Franciscan Road with 27 cases, Sellincourt Road and Tooting Graveney with 20 cases each, and Ensham Street with 19 cases, were the schools principally attacked during the year. In Wandsworth, Swaffield Road with 45 cases, the Wandle with 29 cases, Brandlehow Road with 23 cases, West Hill with 16 cases, and Waldron Road with 15 cases, were the schools chiefly affected. 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Medical Officer of the London County Council excluded four children from two schools during the year, in April and May, until a medical certificate was received to the effect that the child was free from infectious disease. The homes of these children were visited, in some cases two or three times, to see that medical attendance was provided. It was necessary to carry out disinfection in Cavendish Road Special, Hotham Road, Swaffield Road, Larkhall Lane and several private schools, but in all these cases, with the exception of Hotham Road, the disinfection was carried out without closing the schools. Hotham Road, Swaffield Road, and Sellincourt Road Schools were closed one week in advance of the Christmas holidays on account of the prevalence of Scarlet Fever at these schools. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Diphtheria and Enteric Fever notified. as well as the total cases notifed from these diseases during each week of the year 1914 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 61 The 11 cases which occurred in an Institution in Clapham were among the boarders at a school connected with a Convent in that sub-district. The first case was notified on the ist December and the last on the 24th, 11 cases in all being notified. The school was visited by the Deputv Medical Officer of Health in consultation with the Medical Attendant and an examination of the remaining children made. A child was then discovered in a peeling condition and was at once removed to hospital and no further cases followed. In Putney seven cases occurred among the resident scholars in connection with a Convent. The first case, which was infected by a visiting master who resided outside the borough, was notified on the 27th February and the other cases occurred at short intervals up to the 28th March. With the exception of the first case, which died, all the cases were of a mild type. A slight outbreak of Scarlet Fever occurred at the Royal Victoria Patriotic Schools, Wandsworth. The first case occurred on the 23rd February, and other cases occurred at short intervals up to the 21st April. In all 30 cases were notified, all of them being of a mild type and no deaths occurred. All precautions were taken and the Medical Officer in charge carried out daily examination of all contacts so that the outbreak was minimised to a large extent. Disinfection of the dormitories, bedding, etc., was carried out by the sanitary staff, and after the 21st April no cases occurred up to August, when the Institution was taken over by the Military Authorities as a General Hospital. During the year Scarlet Fever was exceedingly prevalent, not only in the Metropolis, but in the districts surrounding it. The rate of incidence in this Borough was considerably under that for the whole of London, the rate in the Borough being 4.33 and in London 5.64 per 1,000 of population. In the various sub-districts the rate was lowest in Clapham, next in Streatham, followed by Putney, Wandsworth and Tooting. 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In spite of the fact that the number of cases notified was the highest recorded for many years, the case mortality was the lowest on record. The increase of work caused by the outbreak was very great, but in spite of the depletion of the staff on account of war services the usual inquiries were carefully carried out and all necessary precautions taken. During the months of October and November, and up to the nth December, the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board were quite full and the utmost difficulty was experienced in getting cases of Scarlet Fever removed. This condition of affairs was not at all conducive in checking the occurrence of the disease, as in several instances multiple cases occurred in households which were in all probability infected by the first case while awaiting admission to hospital. Diphtheria. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified during the year shows an increase compared with the previous year, and is also higher than the average number for the last 10 years. The following Table shows the number of cases notified, the number of deaths that occurred in the separate sub-districts and in the whole Borough for the years 1904-1913 inclusive, the average for the 10 years, and the number of cases and deaths in 1914. 63 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of cases notified was 552, (66 in Clapham, 57 in Putney, 91 in Streatham, 107 in Tooting, and 231 in Wandsworth), compared with 430 in 1913, 431 in 1912, and 510 in 1911. This number was 32 above the corrected, and 96 above the uncorrected decennial average. In all the sub-districts, (with the exception of Clapham and Streatham), there has been an increase compared with 1913, in Putney of 38, in Tooting of 21, and in Wandsworth of 94, while in Clapham the decrease was 17, and in Streatham 14. The greatest number of cases occurred in Wandsworth, and the smallest in Putney. I The number of cases notified per 1,000 of population was i-68, compared with 1.34 in 1913, 1.37 in 1912, and 1.65 in 1911 ; and in London 2.0, compared with 1.6, 1.57, 1.7, and 1.13. 464, or 84.0 per cent, of the cases were removed to hospital where 33 died, and 88 or 16 per cent, were treated at home with eight deaths. The case mortality was 7.4 per cent., compared with 4.2 in 1913, 4.1 in 1912, and 6.6 in 1911. The case mortality for the whole of London for the year 1914 was 7.7 per cent., compared with 5.6 in 1913, 7.4 in 1912, and 8.3 in 1911. The case mortality among cases treated in hospital was 7.1 per cent., and among those treated at home g-o per cent. The following Table shows the number of cases, the case-rate per 1,000 living, for the year and for the 10 previous years, the number of deaths and the death-rate for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts, 65 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The highest case-rate was in Tooting, and the lowest in Streatham. The case-rate for the Borough is .4 under that for the whole of London, and the death-rate is .03 per 1,000 lower. The death-rate per 1,000 in the Borough was .12 compared with .06 in 1913, 06 in 1912, and .11 in 1911, and .11 the decennial average. The Chart (facing page 60) shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. The maximum number of cases, viz.â€”31, was notified in the third week of September, and the minimum, viz.â€”three, in the second week of August, The total number of cases, viz.â€”552, is above the number for 1913, and also the decennial average, but there was no outbreak of any special significance in any part of the Borough, with the exception of two slight outbreaks, one in a school in Tooting in September, and the other in a school in Wandsworth in November. The next Table shows the number of cases notified since 1891, the number of deaths, the notification rate, the death-rate, and the case mortality for 23 years, as also the average for the 23 years, compared with the year 1914. It will be observed the case-rate is .18 lower than the average, and the death-rate is lower by 10 per 1,000, while the case mortality has been reduced from 11.9 per cent, to 7.4. This reduction in the mortality is mainly due to the use of antitoxin as a remedy. 66 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 67 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL. DIPHTHERIA. Year.

No cases of Diphtheria were notified as having occurred in children attending the following elementary schools in the Borough : In Clapham:â€” Parochial, Old Town, Clapham. St. Mary's, Crescent Lane. St. Mary's, St. Alphonsus Road. Telferscot Road. 72 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Putney:â€” Convent of the Sacred Heart, Roehampton. National School (Boys), Roehampton.

In all 20 schools remained free from Diphtheria compared with 31 in 1913. In six schools, viz.:â€”Brandlehow Road, Fircroft Road, Hotham Road, Smallwood Road, Swaffield Road and Roman Catholic, Undine Street, it was necessary to have swabs taken from the throats of the children, and in Brandlehow Road, Hotham Road, Smallwood Road and Undine Street one each, and in Swaffield Road two were found to give positive results, while in Fircroft Road seven were negative and Swaffield Road 14. The Medical Officer of Health, London County Council, instructed the teachers of the Departments in the schools concerned to exclude all children suffering from sore throat, and to forward particulars to me on soecial forms supplied to them. 73 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The above and other precautions that are now taken with regard to this disease in elementary schools have proved most beneficial, and have been the means of checking the occurrence of multiple cases to a considerable extent. Of the total number of cases of Diphtheria, five or .90 per cent, occurred among children under one year, 129 or 23 per cent, among children from one and under five years, 336 or 60.8 per cent, from five and under 15 years, 48 or 8.6 per cent., from 15 and under 25 years, and 34 or 6.1 per cent, from 25 and under 65 years. Compared with the previous year there has been an increase at five and under 15 years. Of the 464 cases of Diphtheria removed to Hospital, 42 were reported not to have suffered from Diphtheria. As will be observed from the number of cases notified, shown in Table XL., Diphtheria, like Scarlet Fever, was more prevalent during the year 1914, than in the five previous years, and this prevalence was general in London as a whole. The mortality was also higher than in the previous five years with the exception of 1909. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 51 cases of Scarlet Fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, compared with 45 in 1913, 39 in 1912, and 52 in 1911. There was also one case of Diphtheria, compared with 14 in 1913, two in 1912, and two in 1911. Four of the return cases of Scarlet Fever occurred in Clapham, one in Putney, 16 in Streatham, nine in Tooting, and 21 in Wandsworth. 74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The return case of Diphtheria occurred in Wandsworth. The following Table shows the date of removal to hospital of the first case, the date of return from hospital, the number of days the first case was in hospital, the date of the first symptoms of the subsequent case, and the number of days elapsing between the return of the first case and the first symptoms of the subsequent case or cases. The average number of days the cases of Scarlet Fever were in hospital was 6o.1, compared with 54.3 in 1913, and in the case of Diphtheria 68 days, compared with 64 in 1913. In eight premises more than one case occurred after the return of a case from hospital, seven cases in one premises, five cases in one premises, four cases in one premises, three cases each in two premises, and two cases each in three premises. In one of the cases complaint was made that the patient suffered from nasal discharge. TABLE XLIII. RETURN CASES OF SCARLET FEVER. Sub-Districts No. Removed to â€¢ Hospital. Returned from Hospital.

Enteric Fever. 48 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year, (five from Clapham, five from Putney, 12 from Streatham, five from Tooting, and 21 from Wandsworth), compared with 50 in 1913, 71 in 1912, and 58 in 1911, and is 30 under the corrected decennial average. 30 of the cases were removed to hospital where five died, and 18 were treated at home with no death. The total number of deaths was five, one in Clapham, one in Putney, one in Streatham, and two in Wandsworth, compared with five in 1913, eight in 1912, and nine in 1911. The number of deaths was the same as in 1913, and is 5.26 under the decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was .14, compared with 15 in 1913, -22 in 1912, and -18 in 1911, and with .17 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from Fever was -015 per 1,000 compared with .015 in 1913, .02 in 1912, and .03 in 1911 ; while the rate for the whole of London was .03, compared with 02 in 1913, â€¢025 in 1912, and .03 in 1911. Of the 30 cases removed to hospital, 10 or 33.3 per cent, were found not to be suffering from Enteric Fever, compared with 18 per cent, in 1913. The Chart (facing page 60), shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. In 21 of the weeks during the year no cases were notified, one case each in 20 of the weeks, two cases each in eight of the weeks, three cases each in two of the weeks, and four cases in one of the weeks. The maximum number of cases, viz.â€”four, was notified in the second week of January. 78 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 48 cases notified 10 were not Enteric Fever, five occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum, leaving 33 cases in which special enquiries were made as to the probable cause of the disease. In four of the cases the disease was probably contracted by eating shell-fish, in five it was contracted outside the Borough in five the infection was contracted from previous cases, while in 19 no history of infection could be ascertained. The four cases which were probably contracted by eating shellfish were all from oysters, partaken at various and untraceable places. Of the 10 cases which were not Enteric Fever two were fatal, one from Appendicitis, and the other from Septicemia following abortion. The notification rate from this disease was the lowest on record, while the death-rate was the same as in 1913, these two years being the lowest yet recorded. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In 112 cases, (57 of Scarlet Fever, 42 of Diphtheria, 10 of Enteric Fever, one of Cerebro-spinal Fever, one of Anthrax, and one of Puerperal Fever), information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's and other hospitals, that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease, compared with 113 in 1913, 88 in 1912, and 102 in 1911. Of 1,740 cases removed to hospital, in 112 or 6.4 per cent, the diagnosis was incorrect, compared with 8.3 per cent, in 1913, 7.8 per cent, in 1912, and 8.5 per cent, in 1911. There has been a slight decrease in the percentage of cases of jnistaken diagnosis, 79 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The highest percentage of mistaken diagnosis occurred in respect of Cerebro-spinal Meningitis and Anthrax, viz.:â€”100 per cent., both cases of each disease removed proving on further examination not to have been suffering from that disease.

Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. Three cases were notified during the year, (two in Clapham, and one in Tooting), compared with nine in 1913, three in 1912, and five in 1911. One of these cases proved not to be Cerebro-spinal Meningitis. Of the remaining two cases notified, one died of Cerebro-spinal Meningitis and the other case recovered, 8o Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In London 73 cases of this disease were notified during the year, compared with 145 in 1913. 21 deaths were registered as having been caused by Meningitis, six in Clapham, one in Putney, five in Streatham, five in Tooting, and nine in Wandsworth, compared with 21 in 1913. Eight of these were of infants under one year, two from one and under two years, two from two and under five years, and nine over five years. As in previous years inquiries were made from the medical attendant, and in all the cases the deaths were stated to have been caused by simple Meningitis. Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 889 bacteriological examinations were made at the Lister Institute, compared with 726 in 1913, 841 in 1912, 624 in 1911, 318 in 1910, 397 in 1909, 491 in 1908, 466 in 1907, 407 in 1906, 174 in 1905, 121 in 1904, 125 in 1903. The following Table shows the number of examinations in each sub-district and for the whole Borough, also the disease for which the examination was made and the result of such examination. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The increase in the total number was due to the greater prevalence of Diphtheria during the year, and the consequent increase in the number of contacts swabbed. Puerperal Fever. 30 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, compared with 32 in 1913, 27 in 1912, 24 in 1911. Six cases occurred in Clapham, six in Streatham, four in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth. Nine of the cases (four in Clapham, two in Streatham, one in Tooting, and two in Wandsworth), or 30 per cent, were fatal, compared with 40 per cent, in 1913, 40 per cent, in 1912, and 33.3 per cent, in 1911, 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 24 of the cases were removed to Institutions (one to St. James's Infirmary, 20 to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals and three to St. Thomas's Hospital, where three died, and six were treated at home with four deaths. The death-rate was .02 per 1,000, compared with .04 in 1913, â€¢035 in 1912, and 025 in 1911. The case-rate per 1,000 births was 4.4 compared with 4 6 in 1913, 4 0 in 1912, and 3-5 in 1911, and for the whole of London 3.5 compared with 3.0. In 13 of the cases registered midwives only were employed while two of the cases were miscarriages, one was premature, three stillborn, and in two, twins were born. Four nurses had free baths, two came from Battersea, one from the West End, one was a district nurse, and the remainder had baths at their own homes. In two cases no nurse was employed. In 25 cases the personal clothing of the nurse was disinfected. In any case where a registered midwife was in attendance a report was forwarded to the London County Council. Erysipelas. 234 cases of Erysipelas were notified during the year and 11 deaths occurred. 44 of the cases and three deaths occurred in Clapham, eight cases and one death in Putney, 60 cases and two deaths in Streatham, 39 cases and one death in Tooting, and 83 cases and four deaths in Wandsworth. In 1913 the number of cases notified was 204, and the deaths six. 40 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary, where seven died. 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Measles. During the year 26 deaths, 16 of males and xo of females, were due to Measles, compared with 116 in 1913, 51 in 1912, and 230 in 1911. Six of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 11 in Streatham, six in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is 90 less than in 1913, and is 78 below the corrected decennial average. Seven of the deaths were of infants under one year, 12 from one and under two years, four from two and under five years, two from five and under 15 years, and one from 45 and under 65 years ; 88 per cent, of the deaths having occurred under five years of age. The death-rate was .07 per 1,000, compared with .36 in 1913, .16 in 1912, and .74 in 1911. The death-rate for the whole of London was .31, compared with 34 in 1913, for England and Wales, .24, and for the 97 Great Towns .35, for the smaller towns .21, and for England and Wales, less the 242 towns, .12 per 1,000. During the year five cases of Measles were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals, from Streatham. These cases removed to hospital were under the care of the District Medical Officers, but during the year the Metropolitan Asylums Board consented to remove other than pauper cases provided the Medical Officer of Health certified that the home conditions were such that the case could not be satisfactorily treated at home. The use of the Fever Hospitals for cases of this disease was discontinued in the summer, and so far has not been renewed, 84 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year 621 visits were made in cases of this disease, (compared with 2,164 in 1913). 182 in Clapham, 28 in Putney, 220 in Streatham, 64 in Tooting, and 127 in Wandsworth. Table XLVII. shows the number of cases of notifiable and nonnotifiable diseases notified by the teachers of the elementary schools in the Borough. In all, 5,802 cases were notified, compared with 4,907 in 1913, 4,706 in 1912, and 6,785 in 191I. 464 of these were cases of Measles, 997 of Chicken-pox, 842 of Whooping Cough, 1,661 of Mumps, and 312 of Ringworm. There was an increase in the number of cases of Whooping Cough, Chicken-pox and Mumps, and a decrease in the number of cases of Measles and Ringworm. With regard to Measles, 153 cases were notified from schools in Clapham, 38 in Putney, 137 in Streatham, 45 in Tooting, and 91 in Wandsworth. The schools chiefly affected were, in Clapham, Haselrigge Road and Telferscot Road ; in Putney, Roehampton National ; in Streatham, Hearnville Road and Oldridge Road; in Tooting, Franciscan Road and Sellincourt Road ; and in Wandsworth, the Earlsfield and Swaffield Road. Very few of the schools were quite free from the disease, but in a considerable proportion only a few cases occurred. As in former years the means adopted for the prevention of the spread of the disease were exclusion from school, education of the parents of children where cases had occurred by means of the pamphlet published in the Report for 1911, and disinfection of the premises after cases had recovered, 85 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The next Table shows the number of premises disinfected after Measles in each sub-district for each month of the year. The total number of premises disinfected was 372 (122 in Clapham, 25 in Putney, 137 in Streatham, 30 in Tooting, and 58 in Wandsworth), compared with 1,454 in 1913, 1,006 in 1912, and 2,638 in 1911. The greatest number of disinfections was carried out in May, this being due to the greater prevalence of the disease in Streatham. The greatest number of cases occurred in February, March, April, May and June. In the other months of the year the number of disinfections was small as there were very few cases in any part of the Borough. TABLE XLIX. Month, Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth.

Eight of the deaths occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, 10 in Streatham, 11 in Tooting, and 22 in Wandsworth. 91 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 24 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 20 of children from one and under two years, and nine from two and under five years. The death-rate was .16 per 1,000, compared with .07 in 1913, .15 in 1912, .21 in 1911, and .20 for the whole of London in 1914. The disease was more prevalent in London, and in this Borough in the year 1914 than in the previous year. In the sub-districts of Streatham, Tooting and Wandsworth, it was more prevalent than in the other sub-districts. The number of cases notified from schools was 842, compared with 496 in 1913, 1,014 in 1912, and 565 in 1911, 300 of these being from schools in the sub-district of Wandsworth, the schools chiefly affected in that sub-district being Riversdale, Brandlehow Road, Merton Road, St. Michael's, Southfield, and Warple Way. There were also 201 cases notified from schools in Tooting, the schools chiefly affected having been Franciscan Road, Tooting Graveney, Fountain Road, Sellincourt Road, and Derinton Road. The greatest mortality from Whooping Cough occurs among children under five years of age. Of the 53 deaths that occurred from this disease, all were of children under five years. 60 cases, three from Clapham, one from Putney, 16 from Streatham, 39 from Tooting, and one from Wandsworth, were removed to hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. No deaths occurred among these cases. The pamphlet, published in the Report for 1910, was left at every house where a case of Whooping Cough had been notified from school, and also in all other known cases. During the year 866 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Whooping Cough, 100 in Clapham, 28 in Putney, 201 in Streatham, 218 in Tooting, and 319 in Wandsworth. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Other Diseases notified from Schools. In addition to the 464 cases of Measles and 842 of Whooping Cough notified by the teachers of elementary schools, there were also notified 997 cases of Chicken-pox, 1,661 of Mumps, 312 of Ringworm, 24 of German Measles, 30 of Inflammation of Eyes, 192 of suspicious Sore Throat, 101 of Impetigo, 26 of Eczema, and 88 of other diseases. Chicken-pox was most prevalent in Streatham and Wandsworth, Mumps in Wandsworth, and Ringworm in Wandsworth. Disinfection of Schools.

Epidemic Influenza. 58 deaths, 25 of males, and 33 of females, were due to this disease, compared with 59 in 1913, 45 in 1912, and 24 in 1911. There has thus been a decrease of one death compared with the previous year, and a decrease of 12.6 compared with the corrected decennial average. 10 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, five in Putney, 32 in Streatham, and 11 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .17 per 1,000, compared with .18 in 1913, .18 in 1912, and .08 in 1911. 22 of the deaths were of persons from 25 and under 65 years, and 29 of persons over 65 years. 94 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Diarrhoea. 186 deaths, 106 of males and 80 females, occurred from all forms of Diarrhoea and Enteritis during the year, compared with 168 in 1913, 85 in 1912, and 350 in 1911. There has thus been an increase of 18 in the number of deaths from these diseases compared with the previous year, but a decrease of 34.2 compared with the corrected decennial average. 26 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 13 in Putney, 48 in Streatham, 42 in Tooting, and 57 in Wandsworth. In all the sub-districts, with the exception of Wandsworth there was an increase compared with 1913. The death-rate was .56 per 1,000 (in Clapham .42, in Putney .44, in Streatham .46, in Tooting i ll, and in Wandsworth .59), compared with 51 in 1913, .27 in 1912, and 1.13 in 1911. The total number of deaths of children under two years was 161, equal to a rate of .49 per 1,000, compared with .47 in 1913, and .22 in 1912, while the death-rate for the whole of London under two years was .67 per 1,000, compared with .68. Of the total number of deaths registered, 136 or 73 per cent. were of infants under one year, compared with 78 per cent. in 1913, 70 per cent. in 1912, and 78 per cent. in 1911. The following Table shows the number of deaths from DiarrhÅ“a and Enteritis under one year for the four quarters of 1914, and for the five previous years, 95 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE L. 1909. 1910. 1911. 1912. 1913. 1914.

The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis, and Enteritis under one year represents 23.3 per cent. of the total mortality at that age, compared with 21.8 per cent. in 1913, 11.6 per cent. in 1912, and 33 per cent. in 1911, so that the increase of the mortality under one year was largely due to the increase in the number of deaths of infants from the above causes. In all the deaths under one year from DiarrhÅ“a and Enteritis, special inquiries were made, and the following Tables show the nature of the food given, 96 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In 59, or 47.5 per cent., cows' milk, either alone or with farinaceous food was given; in 28 or 22.5 per cent., condensed milk only or condensed milk and farinaceous food was given; while in one dried milk only was given. In 11 cases, from various causes no information could be obtained. Of the 135 deaths, 26 died in the Union Infirmary, 14 in hospitals outside the Borough, and 19 had been in attendance at hospitals previous to their death for Marasmus or Debility and kindred complaints, 97 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the cases in which no information was available, two had lived in Common Lodging Houses and could not be traced, two were born in the Workhouse and died in the Union Infirmary, and two mothers of illegitimate children had removed directly after the death of the children. Four of the deaths occurred in good residential districts and no enquiries were made. Of the contributory causes to the infants' deaths it may be noted that two of the mothers were notified as suffering from Puerperal Fever, three were very ill before the confinement and died a few days after giving birth to a weakly child, three mothers were notified as suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and three were very Anaemic and probably Tuberculous. One foster-mother was very ill herself with Diarrhoea and had to go into the Union Infirmary for treatment, and in three cases the mothers had previously lost children with Diarrhoea. In three cases children in the same family had had an attack of Diarrhoea and had probably infected the infant, and in one family a child had died with the disease a fortnight previously. One father suffered from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. In two cases the fathers had been out of work and the mother and children had lacked proper nourishment, in one case the father had neglected the children and ill-treated the mother and was reported to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Ten of the infants suffered from Indigestion and Bowel trouble from birth, eight had been attending hospitals for Bronchial trouble, one was born suffering from Jaundice, one with heart complaint, and two were attending hospital for Rupture. Three babies had Meningitis, and in one family the child next in age to the infant suffered with Tuberculous Meningitis. 98 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In seven cases the mothers stated that difficult teething had made the child more susceptible to the attack of Diarrhoea. In 44 cases the mothers reported a great many flies had been noticed at the time of the child's illness and death, and in three cases there were stables at the rear of the house. Two complaints were made of rabbits or fowls being kept next door. 25 deaths from Diarrhoea occurred among children over one year of age. We had previously visited 13 of these children. 15 deaths occurred in the Union Infirmary and one in a hospital. Three of these children were illegitimate, and one was a nurse child. One infant was of premature birth, four were delicate from birth, two of these were twin children. We found nine children had been fed on cows' milk and farinaceous foods up to their death, eight on Nestle's milk and farinaceous foods, and two each on cows' milk, Nestle's milk and farinaceous foods only. One infant aged 13 months had had nothing but the mother's milk from birthâ€”it was a premature child and very delicate and probably only lived so long by reason of the great care the mother gave it. Of the causes contributory to the infants' deaths, we found one father was out of work and one had grossly neglected his family. One father was certified as suffering from Tuberculosis and two mothers were very Anaemic. Three children had Tubercular bowels, eight had suffered previously with Bronchial trouble, and three had severe teething complaints. 99 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Six mothers said they had noticed many flies at the time of the childs' illness and in two yards we found accumulations of refuse. The next Table shows the result of the inquiries made after these deaths, arranged in Wards, and there is also shown the number of infants who had been previously visited, the number of illegitimate infants, and the social status of the parents. It will also be seen in the Table that only 22 of the infants who died from Diarrhoea had been fed in accordance with the pamphlet left by the Inspectors, and also that of the total number of deaths in which information was obtained, viz.:â€”135, 13 were prematurely born, 38 were delicate from birth, and eight were twin children. 100 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

"It has been impossible to secure the services of any helper since the war broke out, so that the total number of visits paid is less than in the previous year. "There has also been a considerable falling off in the number of second visits. "The total number of visits paid, including re-visits and ineffectual visits was 5,606. The number of first visits totalled 3,337. there were 1,373 second visits and the number of ineffectual visits was 896. "149 visits were paid to the homes to see to the carrying-out of repairs, etc., for which we had served notices. "The largest number of ineffectual visits occurred on our second visits to the mothers, as many had removed and could not be traced. "Whenever successful in finding their new address, we have visited the mother in her new home in order to see that the sanitary conditions were satisfactory. "The total number of visits paid after notification and registration of births will be found in Table LIII. which also shows the method of feeding at the time of the first visit and the number of ineffectual calls. "Among the infants we visited, 120 died, their ages at death are given in Table LV. "51 of these occurred from Diarrhoea and Enteritis, 16 from Bronchitis or Pneumonia, and four from Whooping Cough, eight from Congenital Debility, six from Marasmus, five from Prematurity, two from Asphyxia, and two from Tuberculous Meningitis. "Many infants died from Prematurity previous to our visits, 95 of those visited were born prematurely and 68 children were delicate from birth. 103 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The pamphlet containing advice on the feeding of infants is in every case handed to the mother on our first visit and many of them tell us on our second visit they have found the instructions very helpful. "Where the infants have to be reared by hand we were glad to find that very few long tube bottles are now used. "586 mothers used the boat shaped bottle when resorting to artificial feeding, 42 only used the tube bottle, 28 mothers used both the boat and tube bottles and 34 mothers fed their infants with a spoon. "The use of dummies is still very common, on many instances the mothers tell us they have started the practice on the advice of the midwife or nurse, though the baby did not like it. Other mothers seem to think that though the rubber teat is harmful, one made of some celluloid composition is really hygienic. "We found on our first visits that 1,390 of the mothers had not begun to use the comforter, but 1,672 were using it. On our second visits 431 had discontinued its use, but 131 mothers had begun its use since our first visit. "With regard to the employment of midwives, we found 1,596 out of the 3,337 mothers we visited had employed their services. 13 had been attended by un-registered midwives. In nearly every case these were neighbours or relatives called in in an emergency. "The sanitary defects found in the homes during our visits to the mothers have been remedied, or if requiring structural work, referred to you. "76 intimation notices were served and four statutory notices Were required," 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LIII. Clapham, North. Clapham, South. Putney. Streatham. Balham.

It is satisfactory to observe that with the assistance of the voluntary workers, infants were visited in all the Wards of the Borough, 106 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Out of 3,337 infants, 2,718 or 81.4 per cent. were wholly breast-fed, and 619 or 18.6 per cent. otherwise fed. There is a slight decrease in the number breast-fed compared with previous years. 1,373 infants were re-visited, and of these 876 or 64 per cent. were breast-fed, while 497 or 36 per cent. were otherwise fed, which is also a slight decrease compared with previous years. The total number of deaths among those visited was 120, 15 in Clapham, eight in Putney, 19 in Streatham, 27 in Tooting, and 51 in Wandsworth. Table LV. shows these deaths arranged in monthly age periods. The heaviest mortality occurred at one to two months. It is a most significant fact that the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Enteritis among 2,718 infants who were breast-fed was only six, or a percentage mortality of 22, while among 619 infants who were otherwise fed the number of deaths was 45 or a percentage mortality of 7.2. The mortality among infants otherwise fed was thus 32 times greater than those breast-fed. The mortality among the infants visited by the Inspectors was only 32 per 1,000 births, compared with 88 per 1,000, the rate for the Borough for the year. 107 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

O the total cases notified during the year viz:â€”706, 138 were from Clapham, 46 from Putney, 170 from Streatham, 126 from Tooting, and 231 from Wandsworth, compared with 783 in 1913, of which 154 were from Clapham, 45 from Putney, 209 from Streatham, 89 from Tooting, and 286 from Wandsworth. There was thus a decided decrease in all the sub-districts with the exception of Putney and Tooting, where there was an increase. Two of the cases were under one year of age, 12 from one and under five years 60 from five and under 15 years, 132 from 15 and under 25 years, 337 from 25 and under 45 years, 128 from 45 and under 65 years, and 35 over 65 years. In Table LX. is shown the total number of cases notified since 1908, the number of deaths in each year since that date, the total deaths, the number removed from the district as far as could be ascertained, the number who were stated to have recovered, the number in which no inquiries were made, and the total number of cases still on the Register. In all 3,607 cases have been notified, and of these 1,458 or 40 per cent. have died, 717 or 19.8 per cent. have removed, 97 or 2.6 per cent. are stated to have recovered, in 23 or .6 per cent. no inquiries have been made, while 1,312 or 36.3 per cent. are still on the Register. It will be noted that in 1912, 1913 and 1914 inquiries have been made in every case, although in 40 cases in 1912, 55 in 1913, and 32 in 1914 these inquiries were made at my request by the private medical practitioner.

The 29 remaining cases did not die from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, although notified as such. Four cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis were notified by the School Medical Inspectors of the Education Department of the London County Council, these cases having been discovered in the examination of children at school Of the 706 cases visited by the Inspectors, or in which the information was given by the medical attendant, in 64 this was so indefinite that it was impossible to tabulate it, in the majority of cases no family history being known. 15 cases were notified from Common Lodging Houses, three from Asylums, one from H.M. Prison, three were homeless, in seven cases wrong addresses were given, seven had removed, in eight the patients were either lodgers or domestic servants and the occupier of the house could give no information, in 17 cases no definite information was obtainable, and in only three instances the Inspector was refused information. 118 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 125 Of the 632 cases visited by the Inspectors it has been found possible to include in the Tables as many as 610, 349 of males and 261 of females, as against 640 in last year's Report. The Tables dealing with ages, duration of illness and occupation are self-explanatory, but the Tables dealing with personal and family history are more complicated and require some explanation. These Tables are to be read as follows:â€” In the Table dealing with married males at ages 35-55, 108 cases were notified. Of these, 38 parents had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 69 were living and not affected, 107 died of other diseases, while two were alive but their medical history was not known. In the next two columns under the heading of brothers and sisters, four were alive but affected, and 27 dead of Pulmonary Tuberculosis ; 334 were alive and not affected, and 251 had died of other diseases, while the medical history of eight alive was unknown. In group III which relates to uncles and aunts, eight had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 117 were alive and not affected, and 28 dead of other diseases, while the medical history of 65 was unknown. In the next column it will be seen that the wives of five cases had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 96 were alive and 11 dead not affected. Of the patients' children seven were alive and nine died affected, 283 alive and not affected, and 27 died of other diseases. 19 of the patients were childless. At the other ages the Table is to be read in the same way. Of the total number of males, viz. 1â€”349, had parents alive affected, while 77 had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis 356 parents were alive and not affected while 258 had died, but not of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 126 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Among the total number of females viz.â€”261, nine had parents alive affected, while 59 had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis; 278 parents were alive and not affected, while 173 had died, but not of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Of the total of 610 patients male and female, married and unmarried, 14 had parents alive affected, while 136 parents had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Taking the column dealing with brothers and sisters, among males we find 25 had brothers and sisters alive affected, while 79 had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis; and among females 41 had brothers or sisters alive affected, while 70 had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, or a total among males and females of 59 who had brothers or sisters alive affected, while 149 had died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. With regard to the notification of cases of non-pulmonary Tuberculosis, in all 199 cases were notified, 30 from Clapham, 10 from Putney, 46 from Streatham, 40 from Tooting, and 73 from Wandsworth. 10 O these were under one year of age, 49 from one and under five years, 79 from five and under 15 years, 23 from 15 and under 25 years 27 from 25 and under 45 years, 10 from 45 and under 65 years, and one over 65 years. Table LXVII shows the number of these cases notified classified according to the part of the body affected, as well as the number of deaths in each class. The total deaths, viz., 68 do not correspond with the total number on Table LIX, as seven were registered as having died from Pulmonary Tuberculosis and are included under that heading, six cases died from other causes, three cases which died in 1914 were not notified till 1915 while in the case of seven deaths which occurred in Institutions outside the Borough, no notifications could be obtained Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 127 As is to be expected, the deaths from General Tuberculosis shows the highest mortality, four out of the four cases notified having been fatal and the next highest mortality occurred among cases of Tuberculosis of the Brain, 43 out of 44 having been fatal. Out of the total of 199, 68 died, five have removed to other districts, while 126 cases are still on the Register and under observation. 128 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXVII.

Table LXIX. is a summary of notifications during the period from the 4th January, 1914, to the 2nd January, 1915, and has been prepared at the request of the Local Government Board. It will be seen that 687 primary notifications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis were made on Form A, 401 of males and 286 of females, while the total notifications were 876. Four cases were notified by School Medical Officers on Form B, three of males and one of females, while 214 notifications from Poor Law Institutions and 201 from Sanatoria were made on Form C. The number of notifications on Form B by School Medical Officers is exceptionally small. From other forms of Tuberculosis 190 were notified on Form A, four by School Medical Officers on Form B, while 15 were notified from Poor Law Institutions and six from Sanatoria on Form C. It may be stated that notifications on Form A are primary notifications, i.e. cases not previously notified. Form B are notifications from School Medical Officers, and Form C are secondary notifications from Poor Law Institutions and Sanatoria on entering such Institutions. 130 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 133 The total number of visits made was 2,722 in cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 509 in Clapham, 145 in Putney, 661 in Streatham, 461 in Tooting, and 946 in Wandsworth, and 525 in cases of other forms of Tuberculosis, 80 in Clapham, 23 in Putney, 104 in Streatham, 117 in Tooting, and 201 in Wandsworth. In addition to these visits by the Health Visitor, 253 visits were made by the Dispensary Nurse, these visits being made by the instruction of the Tuberculosis Officer to cases under his care at the Dispensary. These numbers are extremely satisfactory when the area of the Borough is taken into consideration. 32 of the cases under observation removed to other places and the Medical Officers of Health of these were duly informed, while 25 cases notified in other districts were notified to me by the respective Medical Officers of Health. During the year 30 sputum flasks have been supplied, and two were returned after the death of the patient. In 13 of the cases visited the patients already had one, but in many cases the patients objected to their use. Tuberculosis Dispensary. It will be seen from the Report of the Tuberculosis Officer, Dr. F. G. Caley, that a very large amount of work has been carried out during the year, although the absence of the Tuberculosis Officer on military duty and the necessary alteration of the dispensary arrangements resulted in a slight decrease in the number of cases dealt with. It is satisfactory to note that arrangements have now been made by the London County Council for the treatment in sanatoria of non-insured persons, and since June, 1914, seven cases have been admitted to sanatoria under the scheme up to the end of the year. 134 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. I am still of opinion that, especially in the case of children certain patients should have open-air treatment other than at home, and it is to be hoped that shortly this will be available. The question of prevention has again occupied a prominent place in the work of the Dispensaries during the year. The examination of contacts, which is dealt with in the report of the Tuberculosis Officer, shows that 421 contacts were examined, and of these 28 or about 6.65 per cent. were found to be Tuberculous. I am also able to report that the Dispensaries have been utilised to a very large extent by the medical profession no fewer than 170 cases having been sent by their private medical attendants. With regard to cases of Tuberculosis among insured persons, of 363 cases notified 88 have been, and 47 are at present in sanatoria. 15 of these were in sanatoria for less than one month, 15 from one to two months, 30 from two to three months, 15 from three to four months, three from four to five months, seven from five to six months, and three for six months and over. With regard to their condition after return, 40 were improved and able to work, while 23 were stated to have improved, but unable to work, 11 were worse, and 14 died, four of these at home and 10 in sanatoria. After return from sanatoria 54 patients had domiciliary treatment, 10 had dispensary treatment, three were treated in the Infirmary, two were treated in hospitals, while nine removed and the form of treatment could not be ascertained. During the year disinfection was carried out at 399 premises either after the death or removal of the patient, compared with 420 in 1913, 426 in 1912, 313 in 1911, 265 in 1910, 255 in 1909, and 184 in 1908. 84 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, 26 in Putney 53 in Streatham, 53 in Tooting, and 140 in Wandsworth. 135 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Report of Tuberculosis Officer. The work done at the Dispensaries has developed since the previous year. The arrangement with the London Insurance Committee or the Tuberculosis Officer to examine as Exper Medical Adviser, cases recommended for Sanatorium Benefit, came into operation in January. 127 cases have been dealt with under this arrangement. Of these, 124 had not previously attended the dispensaries three had already attended in 1913. Five of the 127 were found to be nontuberculous. Of the remaining 122 cases, 79 were recommended and received sanatorium treatment, 14 hospital treatment, 11 dispensary treatment and 18 domiciliary treatment. During the year, the London County Council completed arrangements for the treatment in sanatoria of non-insured persons, principally children, suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. This is a very important step in the treatment of the disease in children, which is frequently in an early stage, where Sanatorium treatment is most beneficial. Under this scheme, seven children have been sent to Naylands Sanatorium, six of them were still in the Sanatorium at the end of the year, three having been there six months, two three months, and one six weeks. The seventh child was discharged from the Sanatorium after three month's treatment. The London County Council requ.re that the children be examined at the dispensary on discharge from the Sanatorium and afterwards at intervals of three or six months. In this way the child is kept under observation and if a relapse occurs can eceive further treatment. The arrangement made with St Thomas's Hospital for eference to that Institution of cases requiring additional methods of diagnosis has been in operation throughout the year. 136 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It has been found that the cases requiring such aids to diagnosis are few in number, but it is a great advantage to be able to send difficult cases to the hospital for examination by methods not available at the dispensary. As a rule the patient is admitted and kept under close observation for a few days. A thorough examination is made and a report sent to me by the Tuberculosis Officer at the hospital. Nine cases were dealt with under this arrangement and in addition, a number of cases requiring surgical treatment not available at the dispensaries were sent to St. Thomas's Hospital. During the year 971 patients were examined, compared with 936 in 1913. The total attendances at the two dispensaries were 7,657, compared with 5,502 in 1913. Of the new cases, 705 were examined in seven months ending August 5th (declaration of War), 266 in the subsequent five months. With regard to attendances, a similar falling off is shown. though to a less degree. Of 7,657 total attendances, 5 203 were registered in the first seven months, and 2,454 in the last five months of the year. Table LXXII. shows the total insured and non-insured cases of each sex examined during the year, divided into tuberculous and non-tuberculous. It also shows the total attendances made by these cases and the average attendance per case. 379 tuberculous cases made 2,548 attendances, an average of 672 attendances per case, while in 1913, 343 cases made 4,152 attendances, an average of 12.1. There were 226 insured cases, compared with 136 in 1913, and 153 non-insured cases, compared with 207. The lower average attendance this year is mainly due to the larger number of cases which were treated in institutions and by medical practitioners (see Table LXXIX.), and by the increased number of insured patients, many of whom were sent by the Insurance Committee and only made one attendance, 137 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. As last year, the insured cases of Tuberculosis showed more males than females, the un-insured more females than males. 592 non-tuberculous cases made 1,304 attendances, an average of 2.2 attendances per case, compared with 593 cases, 1,350 attendances, average of 2.28 in 1913. In the non-tuberculous cases, females predominated as in 1913. Table LXXIII. is similar to the previous one, only showing the new cases of 1913 which attended during 1914, and the attendances they made. To last year's 343 tuberculous cases have to be added four, classed last year as non-tuberculous, which developed tuberculosis in 1914, making a total of 347. From Table LXXIII. it is seen that 223 of these cases attended during 1914, making 3,126 attendances, an average of 14.01 attendance per case. This average is more than twice that for the 1914 cases (6.72), because the bulk of the 223 cases are regular attendants. TABLE LXXII. New Cases, 1914. Tuberculous. Non-Tuberculous. Totals. M. F.

At East Hill Dispensary there were 664 cases examined, compared with 712 last year, a decrease of 48. At Balham Dispensary there were 307 cases examined, compared with 224 last year, an increase of 83. The attendances at East Hill were 4,856, an increase of 855 on last year, and at Balham 2,801, an increase of 1,300. Table LXXV. shows the sub-districts from which the patients were drawn, and the authorities or agencies recommending them to attend one of the Dispensaries. The largest number of patients came from Wandsworth, the smallest number from Putney. 20 persons came from outside the Borough. These were examined, and if found to be suffering from Tuberculosis, transferred for treatment at Dispensaries in their own areas. The London Insurance Committee figures for the first time as one of the authorities sending patients to the dispensaries. 496 patients, or 51 per cent. were recommended by the Public Health Department, compared with 68.1 per cent. in 1913.

Analysis of Cases. Table LXXVI. shows the number of tuberculous and nontuberculous cases grouped in age periods, and the percentage found to be tuberculous. Of the 971 cases 379 or 39.03 per cent. were tuberculous, and 592 non-tuberculous, compared with 343 or 36.64 per cent., and 592 in 1913. Under the age of 15, there were 68 cases of Tuberculosis, a percentage of 14.75, compared with 106 and 21.5 in 1913. The reduction in these figures for Tuberculosis in childhood is satisfactory. The higher figures for 1913 may have been due to certain accumulation of cases as there had previously been no dispensary to deal with them. At ages 15 and upwards, there-were 311 cases of Tuberculosis, a percentage of 60.98, compared with 237 or 53.5 per cent. in 1913. This increase is due to the patients sent by the Insurance Committee, nearly all of whom were tuberculous. With regard to sexes of tuberculous patients, under the age of 15, there is little difference between the males and females, as in 1913; aged 15 and upwards, there were 174 males to 137 females, while in 1913 there were 154 males and 133 females. The increase in the males is to be expected as Tuberculosis is commoner in males than in females. 141 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXVI.

Examination of Contacts. Table LXXVII. is a similar one to Table LXXVI. but deals with contacts only. The number of Contacts examined for the first time was 421, compared with 541 in 1913. The number found to be suffering from Tuberculosis was lower, viz.:â€”28 or 6.65 per cent., compared with 54 or 9.98 per cent. in 1913. 280 out of 421 were under the age of 15. Of these only five or 1.78 per cent. were tuberculous, compared with 28 or 7.74 per cent. in 1913. Of the 141 aged 15 and upwards, 23 or 16.31 per cent. were tuberculous, compared with 26 or 14.6 per cent. in 1913. As last year, the sexes were equally represented up to the age of 15, while above that age there were many more females than males. As will be seen from Table LXXIII., 280 of the 593 nontuberculous cases of 1913 attended during 1914 and are still free from the disease. These are contacts which are kept under observation so that any symptoms of the disease may be detected at the earliest moment. A further four of the non-tuberculous cases of 1913 have developed tuberculosis during 1914 and are now under treatment for it. They are included with the tuberculous cases in Tables LXXIII. and LXXIX. 143 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXVII.

Of the 379 cases, 329 had Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and 50 Tuberculosis of some other part of the body. 36 of the latter were under the age of 15. It is well recognised that the non-pulmonary forms of Tuberculosis are commoner in children and the pulmonary form in adults. Both these facts are brought in in this Table as they were in the corresponding Table last year. TABLE LXXVIII. SITE OF LESION IN TUBERCULOUS CASES. Age Period. Non-Pulmonary. Total. Glands.

Treatment of Tuberculous Patients. As will be seen from Table LXXVIII. all forms of Tuberculosis are treated at the dispensaries, but as many cases of non-pulmonary form require surgical or hospital treatment, they are unsuitable for dispensary treatment. Such patients are referred to the proper Institution and if possible attend the dispensaries for examination periodically. With regard to pulmonary Tuberculosis, the class of case varies very much. A considerable number of patients were in an advanced stage when first seen, the chance of benefit arising from any form of treatment being very slight. A number were quite hopeless from the onset, the disease ending fatally at an early date. There were, however, a number of early cases which have derived considerable benefit from treatment. The fullest possible use has been made of methods of treatment other than dispensary treatment and many cases have received Institutional treatment. A number of insured patients have benefitted from Sanatorium treatment, though in many instances the period of stay is too short. The recent arrangements for treating non-insured children in Sanatoria promises to produce good results. Advanced cases too bad to attend dispensaries have been treated at home by their own medical practitioners. Table LXXIX. shows the disposal of all the cases of Tuberculosis since the opening of the dispensaries in 1913. The patients are divided into those receiving no treatment and those under treatment. 146 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXIX.

The former includes 10 discharged as recovered, 148 who have left the Borough or lost interest in treatment, and 99 who have died. The 10 discharged as recovered suffered from the disease several years ago and showed no evidence of the disease when discharged. 147 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the first column are 73 patients who were classed as shown in last year's report and have not attended this year. It will be seen that 469 of the 726 cases are under treatment, while in 1913 there were 270, so that there is an increase of 199. 300 were under treatment at one of the dispensaries, compared with 203 last year, and 169 under treatment elsewhere, compared with 67 last year. It is gratifying that the number under treatment elsewhere has increased much more than the number under dispensary treatment, as it shows that treatment in institutions and by the patients own medical practitioners have been employed to a greater extent, and there are many cases which from the first require these forms of treatment more than dispensary treatment. In estimating the permanent effect of treatment in a disease of so long a duration as Tuberculosis, it is necessary to keep patients under observation for a year or two after apparent cure or improvement in symptoms. At present the dispensaries have not been open sufficiently long for an accurate estimate. I have, however, made an attempt to summarise the results to date in some of the cases, and for this purpose have chosen the 300 cases who were under treatment at the dispensaries at the end of 1914. The duration of treatment varies from 21 months to a few weeks, according to the date of the first attendance of the patient. Of the 300 cases, 127 have shown definite signs of improvement, 127 have remained in a stationary condition, and in 46 the disease has advanced. 148 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Tuberculin Treatment. Tuberculin and Spengler's immune substances, I.K., have been used in some of the cases. As regards the former, opportunity for its use is limited by the fact that a large number of the most suitable cases, the early ones, take advantage of the Sanatorium treatment now available. Nor does one feel justified in advising otherwise, as change of air, rest and good food, are in many cases invaluable. Were the residence in Sanatoria of longer duration, it is felt that the results would be more lasting. Tuberculin has been used in some pulmonary cases and in some of tuberculous infection of glands with good results. Of the above-mentioned 300 cases, 24 received treatment with Tuberculin, 14 improving, eight remaining stationary, and two advancing under the treatment. In some of the more advanced cases Spengler's I.K. has been used with benefit and in some febrile cases in children it has been found to effect a reduction in temperature with benefit to the general health. The cases treated by this method are usually more advanced than those treated with tuberculin, so that one does not expect the results to be as good. 33 of the 300 cases were so treated, 12 improving, seven remaining stationary and 14 advancing under the treatment. I.K. is devoid of certain disadvantages attending the use of tuberculin in dispensary practice and it is hoped that when the cases treated with it have been under observation for a longer period, it will be possible to record more good results. 149 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Public Institutions. The following Table shows the number of deaths and the rate to total deaths from this disease for the year 1914, and for the previous 10 years :â€” TABLE LXXX. Year. Total Number of Deaths.

Bacteriological Examination of Sputum. 384 examinations of sputum were made at the Lister Institute : 46 from Clapham, 26 from Putney, 123 from Streatham, 55 from Tooting, and 134 from Wandsworth. In 98 of the cases it was reported that the bacillus had been found, and in 286 that it was absent. Other Infective Diseases 33 deaths were caused by other Infective diseases, four in Clapham, 14 in Streatham, six in Tooting, and nine in Wandsworth. 11 of these were under one year, one from one and under two years, one from five and under 15 years, 13 from 25 and under 45 years, five from 45 and under 65 years, and two over 65 years. Of these 19 were stated to have been due to Syphilis, nine to Septicaemia, two to Tetanus, one to English Cholera, one to Dysentry, and one to Cerebro-spinal Meningitis. With regard to the number of deaths from Syphilis, 12 were Congenital Syphilis, and seven were of adults from Cerebral Syphilis. 10 deaths were caused by Syphilis in 1913, and 17 in 1912. The number of deaths from this disease, however, give little information as to the general prevalence of venereal diseases among the community, as it is more than probable that a considerable number of the deaths of infants from Congenital Debility and Marasmus is due to this cause. It is now, however, generally recognised that what are entitled the para-syphilitic diseases as General Paralysis of the Insane and Locomotor Ataxy are later manifestations of Syphilis, and if the number of deaths from these is taken as a criterion a more reliable estimate may be arrived at. 151 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In 1914, the number of deaths from General Paralysis was 27, and from Locomotor Ataxy 10, a total of 37, 29 of males and eight of females. In 1913 the number of deaths from General Paralysis was 31, and from Locomotor Ataxy 10, a total of 41, 23 of males and eight of females. The following Table shows the death-rate from Infective diseases for the whole Borough for the year, as well as for the five previous years. TABLE LXXXI.

Ophthalmia Neonatorum. 51 cases were notified, of which nine were in Clapham, four in Putney, 21 in Streatham, five in Tooting and 12 in Wandsworth. 48 of the cases were visited, in one case no inquiries were made, 21 were attended at birth by midwives, nine were treated at hospital as out-patients, one as an in-patient, and four were removed to the Union Infirmary, the 24 remaining being treated at home. One case is still under treatment. Two cases removed and could not be traced, and four died of Convulsions, Heart disease, congenital debility and specific disease, respectively. The 41 remaining cases have recovered. One child, aged nine weeks, came from Liverpool on September 1st and was removed to the Infirmary on September 3rd., the case being notified from there. It was still an in-patient at the end of year. Of the two cases under treatment at the end of 1913, one infant has lost the sight of one eye, but the other eye is clear, and the other child has recovered. The Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorium) Regulations, 1914, came into force on the 1st April, by which midwives in addition to Medical Practitioners were required to notify cases occurring during their attendance on the mother and child. Nine cases were thus notified by registered midwives, of which seven were also notified by medical practitioners. Glanders and Anthrax Orders. No cases of the above diseases were notified under the above Orders by the Veterinary Inspector of the London County Council. One case of Anthrax in a human being was notified and removed to hospital, but on further examination there the diagnosis was not confirmed. 153 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Cancer. The total number of deaths from Cancer and other malignant diseases was 393, 162 of males and 231 of females, compared with 352 in 1913, 338 in 1912, and 321 in 1911, an increase of 41 compared with the previous year, and of 68 compared with the corrected decennial average. The corrected death rate was 1.20 per 1,000, compared with 1.07 in 1913, 1.07 in 1912, and 1.04 in 1911. 154 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The greatest number of deaths occurred from Cancer of the Intestines, which include Cancer of the Rectum. The next Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 for each of the sub-districts and for the whole Borough for the year and for the 10 preceding years. TABLE LXXXIV.

There has again been an increase in the rate from this disease in all the sub-districts compared with the decennial average. It is specially noticeable that the death-rate in Tooting is the lowest and that in Putney and Streatham the highest of the sub-districts compared with this average. In the decennium 1851-1860 this rate for England and Wales was only 32.5, but it increased in 1891-1900 to 75.8, and for London only in the decennium 1851-1860 it was 42, and for 1891-1900 85, or slightly more than double. 156 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The comparative percentages or London are also shown, and it will be noted that in the twenty years 1893.1912 these increased in London from 26.9 to 43.5 with an average of 34.67, and in Wandsworth from 16.6 to 32.8 with an average of 22.73. in this Borough the percentage is lower than for the whole of London, and this is what might be expected in consequence of the social condition of the population, but in spite of this, it is rather startling to find that 35.0 per cent. of the total deaths occurred in institutions, and that for the year 1913, 17.2 per cent. occurred in Workhouses and Workhouse infirmaries. Compared with the 20 years1 average, the greatest increase has occurred among the deaths in General and Special Hospitals. 166 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXXVlll.

The whole area of the circle represents the deaths from all causes, and the various segments the deaths from particular diseases or groups of diseases. it will be observed that, as in previous years, the deaths from Tuberculosis, Cancer, diseases of the Circulatory and Nervous systems, and diseases of the Respiratory Organs contribute very largely to the total mortality and also that the notifiable diseases, other than Pulmonary Tuberculosis, contribute very little. i68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the year 47 notices with respect to 42 premises were received from the Water Board stating that the supply had been withdrawn. Eight of the premises were in Clapham, 12 in Putney, 11 in Streatham, three in Tooting, and eight in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rates from 17 premises, from 13 premises in consequence of defects, and in 12 the premises were empty. Compared with 1913, there has been a decrease of 18 in the number of notices received, and of 31 in the number of premises affected. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 169 Mortuaries. The Mortuaries in Clapham, Streatham, Tooting and Wandsworth have been visited several times during the year, and I am able to report that the By-laws and Regulations have been carried out in a satisfactory manner. With reference to the Wandsworth Mortuary the Public Health Committee have on several occasions had the question of providing a new Mortuary for Wandsworth before them, and plans have been prepared and laid before the Committee, but owing to the war the matter has been postponed. The Mortuary at Tooting has been closed, but a temporary one has been provided pending the erection of a new one in Wandsworth. in Clapham, 29 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, compared with 40 in 1913; in Streatham 46, compared with 51; and in Wandsworth 115, of which 57 were from Wandsworth, 32 from Putney, seven from Streatham and 19 from Tooting, compared with 114 in 1913â€”a total of 190 compared with 205 in 1913. No infectious cases were admitted to any of the Mortuaries during the year. GENERAL SANITARY WORK IN 1914. The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the year:â€” (i)â€”Special inspection was made of the land at the rear of Ravensbury Road in the Borough of Wimbledon on account of complaints as to damp conditions arising from the flooding of the land for use as a Skating pond. I inspected the land with the Medical Officer of Health for Wimbledon, but could find no nuisance to any premises in this Borough arising from the 170 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. flooding. The boundary ditch was also inspected and steps were taken to have this cleaned out so as to remove any serious obstruction to the flow of water in the ditch. The land has now been raised about six feet and consequently no further flooding can be carried out. The ditch has been inspected on several occasions since and no nuisance found. (2)â€”Special inspections were also made of certain houses and localities on account of flooding after the severe storm of June 14th. The streets chiefly affected were, in Putneyâ€”Campion Street and Upper Richmond Road; in Streathamâ€”Besley Street, Broadway, Christchurch Road, Hambro Road, High Road, Hopton Road, Killieser Avenue, Mitcham Lane, Wellfield Road, Calbourne Road, Fernlea Road, Gosberton Road, Mayford Road, Ravenslea Road, Rossiter Road, Rowfant Road, Selkirk Road, and Tantallon Road; in Tootingâ€”Defoe Road, Furzedown Market, Marlborough House and Mitcham Road; and in Wandsworthâ€”Bellew Terrace, Earlsfield Road, Garratt Lane, Headworth Road, Lydden Grove, Maskell Road, Portinscale Road, Rusholme Road and Summerstown. Steps were taken at once to remedy the damp conditions and the officials of the Council both from this Department and the Surveyors assisted the owners and occupiers of the houses in every possible way. Many basements were cleansed and disinfected by the Council's staff, and in about 14 days all the cases had been satisfactorily dealt with. There was no consequent illness in any of these houses as far as could be ascertained. (3)â€”As in previous years, special inspections were made of several localities in consequence of complaints of smells from road gullies and sewer ventilators. The number of complaints was greater than in the previous year ; this having been due to the fact that the climatic conditions were more favourable. in all, 138 complaints were received, compared with 90 in 1913: three from Clapham North, three from Clapham Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 171 South, 11 from Putney, 34 from Streatham, 13 from Balham, 20 from Tooting, 22 from Southfield, nine from Fairfield, and 23 from Springfield Wards. All these complaints were forwarded to the Borough Engineer, who reported that in 112 cases the sewers were flushed and disinfected, in 17 the manholes were temporarily sealed, in seven ventilating columns were erected, while in two cases broken manhole plates were repaired. (4)â€”Special inspections were also made by myself and the Deputy Medical Officer of Health of many premises, chiefly on account of nuisances and damp conditions reported to the Sanitary inspectors and also to ascertain if any of these premises could be reported to the Council under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, and also the by-laws as to Underground Rooms, made under the above Act. (5)â€”Special inspection was made of the Osiers, Point Pleasant, Wandsworth, owing to the outbreak of Swine fever and the necessary slaughtering of swine at the piggeries. All the work carried ont, both as regards slaughtering, cleansing and disinfection was satisfactory. including the house-to-house inspections and inspections for certificates under the Revenue Act, but excluding the routine inspection of bakehouses, slaughter-houses, cowsheds, and offensive trade premises, 380 inspections were made of premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices. My attendance at the Police Court was necessary on four occasions during the year. Revenue Act. During the year 10 certificates were granted under the above Act, one deferred, and three refused. The certificates granted referred to 47 houses or 95 tenements, that deferred to eight houses or 16 tenements, and those refused to 38 houses or 76 tenements. 172 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Mousing. Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. All the house-to-house inspections during the year have again been carried out under and for the purposes of Section 17 of this Act, and the results of these inspections have been recorded on the cards, particulars of which were given in the Report for 1910. it has not been found necessary to take any action under this Act, as it has been found, after careful consideration and personal inspection, that the nuisances detected could all be dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The tables of house-to-house inspections show, as in former years, the name of the street, the number of houses inspected, the number of houses in which defects were found, and the number of families living in one, two, three, and four rooms and upwards. The defects found are given in the Table of Sanitary Operations, as also the number of intimation and statutory notices served and complied with. Underground Rooms. Several inspections were made of property to ascertain if any additional underground rooms existed, but no cases were this year discovered in which there was illegal occupation of such rooms. All the houses erected for occupation by the working classes during the past 15 years have no basements, and consequently the number of underground rooms in this Borough is very small. Sanitary Operations. Tables LXXXIX., XC., and XCI., show the number and nature of the inspections made during the year by the Male and Female inspectors respectively. These Tables show in more detail the varied character of the work carried out by the inspectors. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 173 The number of complaints received and attended to was 2,548, compared with 2,394 in 1913. 2,528 in 1912, and 2,076 in 1911. There was an increase in Clapham North and South, Streatham, Southfield, and Fairfield Wards, and a decrease in Putney, Balham, Tooting, and Springfield Wards, compared with the previous year. Three of these complaints were made to the London County Council, and these were at once attended to. The number of houses and premises inspected was 40,004, an increase of 1,201 compared with 1913, and of 3,668 compared with 1912. There was an increase in the number of houses and premises inspected in Clapham North and South, Putney, Balham, Tooting, Southfield, Fairfield, and Springfield Wards, and a decrease in Streatham Ward. The total number of house-to-house inspections made was 2,396, compared with 2,739 in 1913, 2,674 in 1912, and 2,486 in 1911. There has been an increase in the number of these inspections in Clapham North, Streatham, and Balham Wards, and a decrease in Clapham South, Putney, Tooting, Southfield, Fairfield, and Springfield Wards, compared with 1913. The number of these inspections has diminished owing to the changes in the inspectorial staff on account of the war, and the necessary inspections in some of the sub-districts of premises occupied by the military. 174 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The baths at the Disinfecting Station have been more used this year, chiefly owing to the increase in the number of contacts with cases of infective diseases. The names of 355 children, 55 belonging to Clapham, two to Putney, 28 to Streatham, 86 to Tooting, and 184 to Wandsworth, stated to be in a verminous condition, were forwarded to me by the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Inspectors. In the majority of cases only the heads of the children were verminous, but in a few cases the body and clothing were also verminous, 194 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 203 Ice Cream Premises. At the end of 1913 there were 346 of these on the Register. During 1914, 15 were added and 15 removed, leaving a total of 346 on the Register, 531 inspections were made of these premises during the year and 43 notices were served, all of which were for cleansing. Proceedings were instituted against one ice cream vendor for not having his name and address on the barrow. A fine of 3s. with 2s. costs was inflicted. Houses let in Lodgings. At the end of 1913 there were 292 houses let in lodgings on the Register. None were added during 1914, and none removed, making a total of 292 on the Register at the end of 1914. 1,045 inspections of these were made during the year, and 492 notices were served, 17 for overcrowding and 475 for other conditions, chiefly cleansing. On the whole the By-laws have been satisfactorily complied with, although in some instances the cleansing was not carried out at the specified time. Offensive Trade Refuse. I have again to report that the arrangements which have been made by the Council with a contractor for the removal of this refuse have during the year, worked quite satisfactorily, and no complaints have been received. In a certain number of cases this refuse is removed privately, and this has also been carried out in a satisfactory manner. 204 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Unsound Food. 21Â½ cwt. turnip tops, 234 lbs. tomatoes, 37 lbs. broad beans, 17 boxes pears, three bags walnuts, 23 lbs. skate, one box cods roes, one box flat fish, 10 boxes kippers, one box hake, four boxes haddock, one box mixed fish, one trunk whiting, one carcase and 130 lbs. beef, one cwt. sugar, one case eggs and six livers were destroyed at the request of the owners and the usual certificates granted. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. There has been a decrease in the total number of inspections of the above, compared with 1913, but an examination of the Tables will show that a very large amount of work has been carried out by both the male and female inspectors. I have also this year visited a large number of these premises and am able to report that they are all in a very satisfactory condition. With regard to outworkers it has again been found necessary, as a matter of routine, to forward a warning letter to the majority of employers. The Tables which follow are similar to those used in previous Reports, and the whole of the work done by both male and female Inspectors is there shown in a concise form. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,741, including 116 retail bakehouses, 129 workshop laundries, 273 dressmakers' and milliners' premises, and 1,223 other workshops, but not including 463 factories, 1,218 workplaces, and 351 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces, and outworkers' premises, there were on the Register at the end of 1914, 3,774 premises, compared with 3,774 in 1913. 3.629 in 1912, and 3,470 in 1911. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 205 The total number of notices served was 364, 354 intimation and 10 statutory, compared with 454 in 1913, 402 in 1912, and 462 in 1911. There were no prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the year. Under the head of other workshops are included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale are included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. In all 785 inspections were made of 463 factories, and 62 notices 60 intimation and two statutory, were served. The total number of the workshops on the Register was 1,741, 129 of which were workshop laundries, 116 workshop bakehouses, and 1,467 other workshops. In all 2,649 inspections of these were made, compared with 3,185 in 1913, 3,227 in 1912, and 3,059 in 1911, and 141 intimation and five statutory notices were served. The total number of workplaces on the Register was 1,218 and 1,745 inspections were made, while 132 intimation notices were served, but only three statutory notices were necessary. The total number of defects found was 524, including 22 cases in which there was a breach of special sanitary requirements for bakehouses, compared with 539 and 16 in 1913. To abate these nuisances, 343 notices, 333 intimation and 10 statutory were served, all of which, with the exception of nine were complied with at the end of the year. The nine outstanding were complied with in the first month of this year. Excluding outworkers' premises 524 defects were found and 515 remedied, but only 333 intimation notices were served, as one notice frequently called attention to several defects on the same premises, 206 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. â€  The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of the lists received from those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employerâ€”in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 210 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all, 116 lists were received twice in the year, containing the names and addresses of 60 contractors and 349 workmen and seven lists once in the year, containing the names and addresses of three contractors and 62 workmen. There has been a slight increase in the number of outworkers employed by employers in the Borough during the year. The total number of addresses received from other Councils was 507, compared with 521 in 1913, 511 in 1912, and 408 in 1911, and 290 addresses were forwarded to other Councils, compared with 276 in 1913, 285 in 1912, and 251 in 1911. The number of addresses received has decreased by 14 and the number sent has increased by 14. The following are the districts to which lists of outworkers were forwarded, and also the number of outworkers Stepney 56, Battersea 54, Lambeth 46, Croydon 21, City 17, Hammersmith eight, Camberwell six, Southwark five, Winchester and Chelsea four each, Southwark and Kensington three each, Holborn, Worthing, Wimbledon, Hanwell, Eastleigh, East Ham, Willesden, Rochford, Southgate, East Ashford, Shoreditch, Lewisham, Finsbury, Deptford, Stratford, Bermondsey and Bethnal Green two each, West Ham, Walthamstow, Barnes, Stoke Newington, Hampstead, St. Pancras and Bexley one each. 39 names and addresses were forwarded to this Borough in error, and are not included in the above Table. The number of notices sent to employers during the year was 61, compared with 76 in 1913, and these had a most satisfactory result. At the end of 1913 there were 361 outworkers' premises on the Register, 123 were added and 133 removed during the year, leaving 351 on the Reigster at the end of 1914. 541 inspections were made of these premises during the year, and 21 notices, all for cleansing, were served and complied with, 211 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. During the year 15 cases of infective diseases, nine of Scarlet Fever, five of Diphtheria, and one of Erysipelas, were notified as having occurred in the homes of outworkers, compared with 20 in 1913, 16 in 1912, and 15 in 1911. In none of these cases was it necessary to make any order under Section 110 of the Factory and Workshop Act. TABLE CX. 4.â€”REGISTERED WORKSHOPS.

The next Table shows in detail the work of the Inspectors in factories and workshops where males are chiefly employed. The Table shows the work done in each sub-district and is grouped under five divisions: (1) factories, (2) workshops, (3) domestic workshops, (4) workplaces, and (5) outworkers' premises. The total number of inspections was 3,031, compared with 3,510 in 1913, 4,147 in 1912, and 3,020 in 1911, and of re-inspections 745, compared with 732 in 1913, 656, and 1,141, a total of 3,776 compared with 4,242 in the previous year. 1,040 of the inspections and 174 of the re-inspections were in Clapham, 408 and 75 in Putney, 630 and 197 in Streatham, 157 and 51 in Tooting, and 796 and 248 in Wandsworth. No workshops where males were employed were notified to H.M. Inspector, but 26 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector, all with the exception of five of these having been previously entered on the Register. In all the workshops under the supervision of the male Inspectors no case of overcrowding was discovered. In 75 of these factories, workshops and workplaces the sanitary conveniences were found defective, in four they were insufficient, and in three they were unsuitable or not separate for the sexes. In 140 the workrooms were in a dirty condition, in four they were insufficiently ventilated, and in 217 other nuisances were found. For these 307 intimation and 10 statutory notices were served, and with the exception of nine intimation notices, were complied with. These notices were complied with in the early part of the year. 213 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE CXII. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

The total number of premises inspected was 1,829 (441 Clapham, 284 in Putney, 396 in Streatham, 170 in Tooting, and 538 in Wandsworth). 216 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 210 inspections were made of factories, 801 of workshops, 57 of domestic workshops, 392 of workplaces, and 369 of outworkers' premises,' while 247 premises were visited for inquiry and no workroom found. There were only four cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with two in 1913, one in 1912, and three in 1911, and these were at once abated, and 25 were found to be in a dirty condition, compared with 29 in 1913, 37 in 1912, and 17 in 1911. All the factories and workshops inspected during the year had separate water closets for the sexes, but in four factories and five workshops the water closets were defective. Other nuisances were discovered in one workshop, one domestic workshop, 11 workplaces, and eight outworkers' premises, and these were all abated. It was only necessary to serve 47 intimation notices, and these were all complied with at the end of the year. 24 workshops and three domestic workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspector of Workshops and 29 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector. Only five of the workshops (two in Clapham, two in Streatham, and one in Wandsworth), reported by H.M. Inspector were unknown to the Sanitary Inspectors. The other 24 had been previously reported to H.M. Inspector, or were already on the Register. 217 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Milk and Cream. MILK. 895 samples of milk were produced for analysis during the year. 67 or 7.48 per cent. were reported against as being adulterated or not up to legal standard. 875 samples were purchased officially, of which 67 or 7.6 per cent. were adulterated, and 20 samples purchased informally, of which four were reported against. 39 samples were found to contain added water, 26 were deficient in milk fat, and two were deficient in milk fat and contained added water. Proceedings were taken in 34 cases, and in 33 cases the Public Health Committee, after considering the amount of adulteration and the circumstances of sale, decided not to prosecute the vendors, but to take further samples. 17 samples of milk were taken on delivery at various Public Institutions situated within the Borough. All these samples were reported to be genuine. 91 samples of milk were procured whilst in transit from the farmer to the retailer, the samples being taken as the milk arrived at various railway stations within the Borough, both at mid-night and mid-day deliveries. Six samples were reported against as containing extraneous water, viz.:â€”2 per cent., 3 per cent., 4 per cent., 4.5 per cent., 6 per cent. and 6 per cent. respectively. Proceedings were instituted against the farmer of the two last mentioned samples. The summonses were dismissed, the farmer having satisfied the Magistrate that the milk was sold and delivered in the same condition as it came from the cow. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 231 14 samples of milk were procured during the early morning (from 3 to 4 a.m.), from wholesale dealers whilst delivering milk to the retailer. All these samples were reported to be genuine. Six samples of milk were procured on delivery at private houses, two were reported as being adulterated. The adulteration being small, no proceedings were taken, but the vendor was warned. TABLE CXXIII. Premises. No. of Samples taken. No. Adulterated. Percentage Adulterated.

In two cases proceedings were taken against milk vendors for selling milk from receptacles upon which their name and address were not conspicuously inscribed. (See other offences, Table CXIX.) In 12 cases the defendants relied on a warranty, and in each case the Magistrate was satisfied that the milk sold was in the same condition as received. 232 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Proceedings were taken against a milk carrier for refusing milk for analysis and a penalty of 40s. and costs or one month was imposed. Proceedings were also taken against a milk vendor for wilful obstruction, but as the vendor absconded before the summons was served the case was not dealt with. It is satisfactory to report that not a single sample of milk out of the 875 samples submitted was found to contain a preservative. The following Table shows the number of milk samples taken, the number found adulterated, and the percentage adulteration for the past 10 years, compared with the year 1914. TABLE CXX1V. Year.

BUTTER. 478 samples of butter were submitted for analysis during the year, of which 77 or 16.1 per cent. were reported against, compared with 12.67 in 1913, 25.4 per cent. in 1912, 16.4 per cent. in 1911. Of the 478 samples of butter analysed 35 samples were taken officially, 20 or 57 per cent. were reported against, whereas of those samples taken informally 57 or 12.8 per cent. were found to be adulterated. In 19 cases proceedings were instituted against the vendors of the adulterated samples. The penalties and costs amounted to Â£57 14s. 6d., compared with Â£50 8s. 0d. in 1913 and Â£150 6s. 6d. in 1912. The following Table shows the number of butter samples taken, .the number found adulterated, and the percentage of adulteration, together with the average adulteration for the years 1904-1913 compared with the year under review. 236 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Four samples of margarine were submitted for analysis and all returned as genuine. There were four convictions under the Margarine Act, these being in connection with the Sale of Margarine as butter, see Table CXVIII. CHEESE. Six samples of cheese were analysed and all reported to be genuine, 237 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. LARD. 53 samples ol lard were analysed and all reported to be genuine. FLOUR. Three samples of flour were analysed and found to be genuine. COFFEE. 32 samples of coffee were examined, four of which were reported against as containing chicory. In these cases a declaration was made by attaching a label to the tin and no proceedings were taken. COCOA. 21 samples of cocoa were analysed and all reported to be genuine. SUGAR. 28 samples of sugar were analysed, and all reported to be genuine. MUSTARD. 14 samples of mustard were analysed, and all reported to be genuine. PEPPER. 36 samples of Pepper were examined and found genuine. CONFECTIONERY. 13 samples of raspberry jam were analysed, two of which were reported against, one being procured informally and one officially, each sample contained about 5 per cent. apple pulp. 238 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Proceedings were taken against the vendors who successfully pleaded a warranty given with the jam. Proceedings were then taken against the warrantor who was the manufacturer of the jam for giving a false warranty. At the hearing, the warrantor stated that he was unable to account for the apple pulp found in the jam, and that at the time he gave the warranty, he had every reason to believe that the jam was genuine. The case was dismissed. DRUGS. 83 samples of drugs were analysed, and 11 or 13.2 per cent. were found to be adulterated or not up to the required standard. The samples adulterated were grey powders and prescriptions. Four of the vendors were proceeded against, two for selling a mercury preparation known as grey powder which was deficient in mercury, and two for selling medicine by prescription which had not been properly dispensed as directed by the prescription. The result was that the vendors of the grey powders were ordered to pay costs, and the vendors of Medicine by prescription were convicted and fined 2s. and 18s. costs, and 40s. and 15s. 6d. costs, respectively. OTHER ARTICLES. 106 samples classified under this heading were examined, 17 or 16.0 per cent. being reported against as either adulterated or not up to the required standard. Details of these samples together with the nature of adulteration can be seen on referring to the Report of the Public Analyst annexed. The Inspector who carries out the duties under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts has again performed all these duties in a most thorough and efficient manner, and in addition has satisfactorily carried out all the work in connection with the Rag Flock Act and the Milk and Cream Regulations. 239 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. STAFF. On August 4th, when War was declared, several of the staff of the Public Health Department who were in the Territorial Force were mobilised and since then other members of the staff have joined he forces. The following is a list of those at present serving:â€” Dr. P. Caldwell Smith, Medical Officer of Health. Dr. F. G. Caley, Tuberculosis Officer. Herbert E. Brown, Sanitary Inspector. Robert Brown, Sanitary Inspector. H. F. P. Holliman, Junior Clerk. E. Hunt, Clerk and Dispenser at Tuberculosis Dispensary. As I was on service near London I was able to keep to some extent in touch with the work. Dr. Oliver Field, who was appointed Deputy Medical Officer of Health, has however, since the middle of August, ably supervised the work of the Department and has been of great service to the other officials in the Department. At the Tuberculosis Dispensary, in the absence of Dr. Caley, Ihe Council appointed Dr. P. Nicol, who has carried out the work at both Dispensaries in a very thorough and satisfactory manner. It was also necessary to obtain the services of a dispenser at Wandsworth as the clerk and dispenser there, who had previously served in the R.A.M.C., rejoined, and has now obtained the rank of Quartermaster in that Corps. To fill the vacancy, Mrs. Nicol was appointed and this arrangement has worked successfully. Another change occurred in the staff of the Department owing to the resignation of the Nurse and the vacancy was filled by the appointment of Miss Moores. Two temporary appointments in the Inspectorial staff were made by the Council and the Inspectors appointed have carried 240 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. out the work of the two Inspectors on military service, while in the clerical staff there was only one vacancy and this has been satisfactorily filled. Up to the end of the year four of the disinfecting staff, (A. Blake, T. Brown, W. H. Brown, and E. Tyler), had been mobilised or joined the forces and some difficulty was experienced in obtaining substitutes, but eventually satisfactory arrangements were made. As far as I am able to judge, and this opinion is corroborated by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health, the work of the Public Health Department of this Borough has not been permitted to fall below the satisfactory standard which has been attained during the time I have had the privilege of being the Medical Officer of Health. With regard to the other members of the staff, I am pleased to report that they have carried out all their duties in a most thorough and conscientious manner, and I cannot but specially mention the Chief Clerk of the Department, Mr. A. E. Cooper, without whose assistance and lengthy experience it would have been more difficult to carry on the general departmental work, and in the preparation of this Report his help has been invaluable. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH. ANNUAL STATEMENT Of the work done in the Borough of Wandsworth under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, summarised from the statutory quarterly reports. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Statement of the work done during the year 1914 under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Number of samples submitted. The total number of samples submitted by the Inspector during the year amounted to 1,789. Of these, 963 were taken with the formalities required by the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, whilst 826 were obtained nformally. The statement following gives the result of analyses of all articles submitted. In Tables A and B will be found the details of the articles grouped together in the main statement under the headings "Drugs" and "Other Articles"; whilst Tables C, D, E, and F, give details of all adulterated samples, and are further amplified in the context, 242 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Milk and Cream. The number of samples grouped under the heading "Milk and Cream" amounted to 909. Of these, 889 were taken with the necessary formalities required by the Acts, whilst 20 were submitted informally. The samples were comprised as follows:â€” No. of samples examined. No. of samples found adulterated or not up to standard. Formal. Informal. Total. Formal. Informal. Total.

Milk 7.0 0 Separated Milk 16 0 Skimmed Milk 60 0 Condensed Milk 0 0 Cream, fresh 40 0 Cream, preserved 0 0 246 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The nature and extent of the adulteration reported. As regards the milk samples, the greatest adulteration in respect of extraneous water occurred in the case of formal sample No. 90, where it amounted to 18 per cent. The greatest deficiency in milk fat occurred in the case of formal sample No. 38, where it amounted to 97 per cent. Formal samples Nos. 63, 440 and 462 followed closely with a milk fat deficiency of 92, 88, and 73 per cent. respectively. Of the creams purchased as "fresh" 4 samples of the 10 samples submitted were found to contain a boron preservative. The amounts present, expressed in terms of crystallised boric acid, ranged from 0.26 per cent., in the case of both formal samples Nos. 168 and 174, to 0.20 per cent. in the case of formal sample No. 155. Of the cream purchased as "preserved" all 4 samples were found to contain a boron preservative ranging from 0.25 per cent. in the case of formal sample No. 156 to 0.12 per cent. in the case of formal tample No. 158. The fat content of all creams examined ranged from 33.4 per cent. to 62 per cent. The details of all adulterated samples grouped under this heading are given in Table C. The presence of preservatives. All milks were systematically examined for the presence of preservatives, but in no instance was a positive result obtained. The following Table illustrates the number of cases in which preservatives were found in the milk supply of the Borough in this and the three preceding years. Year. Total No. of samples examined.

The average composition, in regard to milk fat and solidsnot-fat, of the milk samples (exclusive of adulterated samples) submitted during each fortnight of the year was as follows :â€” Milk fat. Solids-not-fat Milk fat. Solids-not-fat 1 3.60 8.83 14 3.44 8.70 2 3.53 8.83 15 3.42 8.78 3 3.42 8.78 16 3.72 8.73 4 3.38 8.92 17 3.58 8.70 5 3.50 8.91 18 3.44 8.66 6 3.51 8.81 19 3.52 8.88 7 3.17 8.73 20 3.66 8.85 8 3.42 8.84 21 3.64 8.85 9 3.59 8.90 22 3.68 8.88 10 3.64 8.91 23 3.88 8.88 11 3.63 8.90 24 3.62 8.79 12 3.33 8.67 25 3.91 8.88 13 3.48 8.80 26 250 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Chart here inserted presents in a graphic form this variation in average composition. For the whole year the average composition proved to be:â€” Milk-fat 3.54 per cent. Solids-not-fat 8.82 per cent. Butter. Extent of the adulteration reported. 478 samples of butter were submitted during the year, of which 35 samples were taken with the necessary formalities, whilst 443 were submitted informally, ine total number reported as adulterated, or not up to standard, amounted to 77, or 16.1 per cent. The greatest percentage adulteration occurred in the case of the formal samples, where it amounted to 57.1 per cent., as against 12.8 per cent. for the informal samples. The high percentage in the case of the formal samples, as explained last year, is again due to the fact that formal samples were taken in most instances only when informal sampling showed that systematic adulteration was being practised. In the case of the informal samples the percentage adulteration (12.8) has fallen very considerably from that of the previous year (23.7 per cent.), a result which appears to show that the systematic work carried out in regard to this important article of diet has had a salutary effect in checking adulteration. Nature of the adulteration reported. The nature of the adulteration reported showed that in 38 instances margarine was wholly substituted for butter; in 14 instances mixtures of butter and margarine in varying amounts were sold; and in 25 instances the butter sold contained an excess of boron preservative. Full details of these cases are given in Table D. The presence of preservatives. All samples were examined for the presence of preservatives, with the result that a boron preservative was found in 411 (or 85.9 per cent.) of the samples 251 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. submitted. With the exception of the 25 cases mentioned above, this was present in quantities not exceeding 0.5 per cent. (equivalent to 35 grains per lb.) calculated in terms of Crystallised Boric Acid, the actual amounts and the times of their occurrence being given in Table E. Table D.
