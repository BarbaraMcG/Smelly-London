FR115 LIBRARY FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1 9 3 7. DOROTHY M. CATCHPOOL, M.B., D.P.H., MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31,st DECEMBER, 1937. To the Chairman and Members of the Friern Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, Herewith I present to you a report upon the Health Conditions in your district for year ending December 31st, 1937. The report is drawn up in accordance with circular 1650 of October 4th, 1937, issued by the Ministry of Health. The main points of interest in the statistics are as follows.- (1) A reduction in the birth-rate from 14.5 to 12.4 (2) An increased death-rate from 8.7 to 10.2 (3) No deaths occurred from either diarrhoea and enteritis or from maternal mortality. There has been a marked increase in deaths from heart disease, but a decline in deaths from respiratory diseases, unless the fatal cases of influenza are considered as probably due to respiratory complications. A marked decline in Infantile Mortality is also noticeable, the deaths amounting to 27 per 1000 births, the lowest figure for this district. Generally speaking, the health of the district is very good. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, DOROTHY M. CATCHP00L. M.B., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health. 2.

Local Government Electors. Population. North 4624 9330 Central 4017 7290 South 4134 8680 Friern Hospital 2900 12775 28200 The Registrar Generals estimate of population is 26775. BIRTHS. The number registered in the district was 175, and the number assigned to the district by the Registrar General 329, and this gives a birth-rate of 12.4. The Infantile Mortality rate is calculated on the number of births assigned to the district by the Registrar General. The still-births during the year numbered 16, giving the rate of 48.6 per 1000 births, compared with 33.0 for 1936, and 40.0 for 1935. DEATHS. Table 2 shows in detail the registered causes of death in alphabetical order, their distribution in wards, and particulars of the inward and outward transfers. The number of deaths registered in the district was 235, giving a crude death-rate of 8.90. The nett deaths numbered 254, giving a rate (including institutional population) of 9.28. Since the preparation of the death-table, the Registrar General has assigned 247 deaths to the district, and this will give the uncorrected death-rate of 10.41 per 1000. the correcting factor for ago and sex distribution is 0.98, and this gives a corrected death-rate for comparative purposes of 10.2 per 1000. The infantile mortality rate has decreased, being 27.0 per 1000 births, compared with 51.0 for 1936, and is the lowest yet recorded. Affections of the Heart and Circulatory system continue to be the principal cause of death. Cancer was again the cause of many deaths in persons over the ago of 45. There were no deaths from Infantile Diarrhoea during the year. the deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis are the same as for the two previous years. It is interesting to compare the doath-rates each year for the past ten years from this cause. 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 0.47 0.41 0.21 0.47 0.39. 0.57 0.61 0.54 0.53 0.45 4.

Examinations for Diphtheria, Tuberculosis etc, are now made at the laberatory in connection with the Isolation Hospital, but milk, food, water, sewage effluent and virulence tests, are done at the Clinical Research Association Laberatories. Ambulance facilities. We have now an adequate ambulance service worked from the Central Fire Station, under the control of the Chief Officer of the Fire Brigade, with an arrangement between the respective officers of Finchley, Hornsey, Southgate and East Barnet, whereby one or the other stand by for use in any district, should the necessity arise. Nursing in the home. There are three nursing associations working in the North Ward, Central Ward and Brunswick Park, and South Ward respectively. The association in the South Ward has a working arrangement with the Council for the home visiting of cases of Measles. Treatment centres and clinics. These are administered by the Middlesex County Council as the Maternity & Child Welfare Autherity, and the autherity having control of the School Medical Service. 5. Hospitals. There are no General Hospitals within the district, nor any wholly controlled by the Sanitary Autherity. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water supply. The Barnet District Gas & Water Company continue to give an adequate and wholesome supply of water to this district. Mr. J. F. Haseldino, M.Inst.C.E., the Engineer & Manager to the Company, informs me that.- "The bulk of the water supplied is examined bacteriologically every day and detailed examinations are made at each pumping station once a week". The Water Company have an up to date chemical and bacteriological laberatory under the charge of a fully qualified chemist. Samples are sent periodically to independent analysts for their examination, and the following report is characteristic of such examinations.- "This is a clean and bright water free from odour and taste, and neutral in re-action. It is hard in character, free from metals, and contains no excess of saline matter. beth organically and bacteriologically, the water is of a high degree of purity, and is pure and wholesome water suitable for public supply purposes". Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. The extensions to the Sewage Purification Works were completed on the 29th September and the work officially opened by the Chairman of the Council on the 23rd October. Briefly the additions include 3 sedimentation tanks, 3 filter units, 2 upward flow humus tanks, 3 storm water tanks, 6 sludge digestion tanks, 11 drying beds and a sub-pumping station, and installation of electrically driven centrifugal pumps. The sewage was first received from a part of the berough of Hornsey on the 23rd March and the volume recorded from the 1st April to the 27th December was 73 million gallons. The effluent was inspected frequently by the Lee Conservancy beard and samples taken for analysis, all of which were satisfactory. 6. The sludge digestion system does not entirely eliminate odours and this is more noticeable when the atmosphere is humid and heavy. Owing to the limited area of the drying beds it has been necessary to discharge the digested sludge on to the old lagoons from time to time. No appreciable sale has been found for the dried sludge. Mr. A. C. Brown who acted as Resident Engineer during the reconstruction of the works has been appointed as from the 1st November, Manager of the works. The new relief sewer which runs from a point midway between Cromwell Road and the North Circular Road, via Colney Hatch Lane and Friern Barnet Lane to Buxted Road, was completed in March 1937. A sower was relaid in Friern Barnet Road, between The Avenue and High Road. In accordance with the provisions of the Public Health 1936, a survey of sewers is being carried out. Disposal of House and Trade Refuse. Controlled Tipping is still proceeding in the Bethune Park area and on April 8th tipping was commenced at the Eastern end of the Western section of the Central Ward Allotments. The hollow in this land is to be raised to the level of the Crescent Road. Wo are now tipping somewhat closer to houses than for some two years and special precautions have been taken to prevent any cause for complaint, the shoot being so arranged to prevent any dust being blown towards the street whilst the machines are discharging their contents Six other Local Autherities, including two from abroad, have received instruction by the Engineer and Surveyor on this methed of disposal of house refuse during the year, and the employees of two Local Autherities have been trained in the work. Street scavenging. The number of Orderlies has been increased and this service has now been completely equipped with modern trucks, and the roadways of the district are maintained in a particularly orderly and cleanly manner. 7. Rivers and streams. these have been under constant observation. The short length of unculverted brook in Oakleigh Road shows pollution in times of dry weather, by paraffin oil, due to motor car owners putting oil into the surface water gullies, and it is held and becomes noticeable at this spot, because the rush of storm water from the culvert under the railway has scooped deep hollows in the bed of the brook, and the water is quiet enough to allow the oil to come to and remain on the surface. Closet accommodation. The water-carriage system is in operation throughout the district, and there are no privies, middens, or slop water closets. SANITARY INSPECTION OP THE AREA. Tables of inspections made and defects remedied through the action of the Sanitary Inspectors will be found later in this report. A number of complaints regarding the dampness of new houses and flats have been received from tenants, and there is little doubt that the promises are too often occupied before they have dried out. The modern practice of building houses with few coal consuming fireplaces, and plastering internally with non-absorbent plasters, tends to prolong the drying out process, and causes condensation of the warm moisture laden air within the rooms, thus giving rise to the suggestion that dampness is prevalent. A large part of the time of your Sanitary Inspectors is spent in improving the structual condition of the dwelling houses occupied by persons of the working classes; use is made of the powers given by Section 9 of the Housing Act 1936; a few houses being dealt with at a time. During the year the houses in The Avenue district have been put into good order. During the year a travelling fair pitched on a vacant plot of land in the South Ward. The site was promptly visited by your Sanitary Inspectors, and proper provision made for water supply and sanitary services. Several complaints were received, but on investigation no nuisance remedial under public health law was observed. 8. There is no doubt that the noise of these fairs is an annoyance to the residents, and your officers were successful in obtaining an undertaking from the owner of the land not to let it for fair purposes in the future. The Rats and Mice Destruction Act, 1919, is administered by the Middlesex County Council. A number of complaints have been received in respect of premises infested with rats, and these have immediately been forwarded to Mr. A. Chudley, the Rats and Mice Destruction Officer for this district. We are constantly asked to assist various householders, and this help has always been given readily, your Sanitary Inspectors co-operating with the Middlesex County Officer. Smoke abatement. There are no factories within the district using coal fired beilers, and no action has been necessary. Swimming baths and pools. There are no public Swimming Baths or Pools within the district, nor any attached to Restaurants or Road Houses. Eradication of bed bugs. the department continues to give assistance and advice in keeping premises free from vermin, and there has been a marked decrease in the number of such premises brought to our notice. 1. Number of Council houses found to be infested 7 " " " disinfested 7 Number of other houses found to be infested 17 " " " disinfested 7 x x Owing to the ago and structure of the remaining infested houses practical disinfestation measures were impossible. The occupiers were supplied with insecticide on request, and instructed on its proper use with a view to reducing the extent of infestation, 2. the methods employed for freeing infested houses from bed bugs. Stripping of all wall and ceiling papers, removal of picture rails, skirting beards, architraves and other woodwork; spraying of walls, ceilings, floor and woodwork with an insecticide, followed by fumigation with a gas non-toxic to human beings. 3. The methods employed for ensuring that the belongings of tenants are free from vermin before removal to Council houses. Great care in selecting tenants is exercised, but no routine 9. inspection or precautionary treatment of furniture undertaken. 4. Whether the work of disinfestation is carried out by the Local Authority or by a Contractor. The Council's workmen carry out the disinfestation of the Council houses. Disinfestation of privately owned houses is performed by men employed by the owner under the direction of the Public Health Department. 5. The measures taken by way of supervision or education of tenants to prevent infestation or re-infestation after cleansing. Repeated visits are made to the houses after disinfestation has been carried out, to ensure that the treatment has been successful. The tenants are advised that upon any future evidence of returning infestation, they should report the fact immediately to the department. HOUSING.
