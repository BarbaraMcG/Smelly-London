Thompson, who was your Medical Officer of Health during 1948, has left to take up an appointment in the North of England it is my duty and privilege to present the Annual Report for 1948. The vital statistics of the Borough for the year under review are of particular interest in that they point to certain trends in the health of the people, some favourable and others which are not so encouraging. The death rate of 9.9 per 1,000 of the population is lower than that for the whole of England and Wales (10.8 per 1,000 population.) However, while deaths from infectious diseases have declined considerably, deaths from other causes, notably heart disease and cancer, have shown a steady increase during the past quarter of a century. This tendency is not confined to the Borough of Erith and may be regarded as a reflection of a trend which has been noted in the country as a whole. The increase in cardio-vascular disease may well be related to the stress and strain of modern life and is a reminder that progress in the highly organised modern industrial state, while conferring many benefits, has also a debit side in that the anxiety and pace of present day existence place a strain on the heart and blood vessels not usually associated with a more pastoral existence. The tendency of cancer to increase may also be associated with these phenomena but in the absence of more exact knowledge as to the origins of this disease it would be idle speculation to try to relate it to specific causative factors. The incidence of tuberculosis has, on the whole, tended to fall in the Borough during the past 25 years but there is some evidence that an increase can be expected unless greater progress can be made in the hospitalisation of open cases and the relief of overcrowding of tuberculous families which results, in many cases, in the infection of young children. It is pleasing to report that the Council have, during the year, been alive to this danger and have accorded a number of such cases a high priority for re-housing. During 1948, there was, in fact, an increase in the number of cases notified compared with 1947 the figures being 79 cases (74 respiratory and 5 non-respiratory) compared with 66 (58 respiratory and 8 non-respiratory). There were 36 deaths (29 respiratory, 7 non-respiratory) compared with 28 (26 respiratory, 2 non-respiratory) in 1947. The use of mass miniature radiography to supplement existing arrangements for the early detection of this disease may account, to some extent, for the increase in notifications. 3 The infantile mortality rate, that is the number of children per 1,000 live births dying in the first year of life, a sensitive index of the social and economic life of the district, at 22.8 per 1,000, was the lowest ever recorded in the Borough. There has, indeed, been a progressive fall in this rate in the Borough during the past 35 years which is well illustrated by the table on page 13. While improved housing and nutrition and higher standards of living generally have played an important part, the effect of Child Welfare Services in helping to bring about a more enlightened attitude in relation to child care must also be borne in mind. During 1948 there were no deaths from infantile diarrhoea compared with 8 in 1947, a factor which in itself was conducive to a satisfactory Infant Mortality Rate. No cases of diphtheria were notified during 1948, a significant fact which may well be related to the immunisation campaign which has been intensively followed since 1938. During the year much work was done in regard to Health Education and attention is drawn to that part of the Senior Sanitary Inspector's report relating to the Food Hygiene Campaign during which useful work was carried out in popularizing the uses of detergents by caterers and other food traders and in the fostering of a higher standard of personal hygiene. The year 1948 was remarkable for the coming into operation of the National Health Service Act, 1946, as a result of which the Borough Council ceased to be a Welfare Authority and their Maternity and Child Welfare Services were transferred to the County Council. A review of the records of the Borough of Erith in regard to these services shows well the great progress that had been made under the powers possessed by the Council and, while there is a natural regret at the loss of these functions, there may also be a legitimate pride in past achievements. I am sure that Dr. Thompson would wish me, on his behalf, to thank the Council for their support and help during 1948 and to extend this also to all members of the Health Department who worked loyally and well during a period of transition. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LANDON, Medical Officer of Health. 4 G (2) MEMBERS OF COMMITTEES. Health Committee: Councillor G.

Scabies. In accordance with the requirements of the Scabies Order, 1941, the Council inaugurated a scheme for the treatment of Scabies, and for the examination and subsequent treatment, if found necesary, of contacts. On the first of January, 1948, however, the Scabies Order, 1941, was revoked but the Department continued to treat cases of Scabies and contacts as soon as it became aware of them, in order to prevent any spread of the disease. During the year 23 cases and 26 contacts, involving 18 families, were dealt with. Adults, children and contacts were treated in the cleansing section of the Erith First Aid Post. The whole question of the disinfection and disinfestation of clothing, bedding, etc. and the treatment of verminous persons is under review and it is likely that a joint arrangement with the Bexley Borough Council will be decided upon. C (3). Diphtheria Immunisation. The scheme for the immunisation of children against Diphtheria was continued throughout the year, as was also the immunisation of children against Diphtheria and Whooping Cough with a combined vaccine. Immunisation facilities are available at all sessions of the various clinics held in the town. The following table will indicate the number of cases dealt with:— Diphtheria.

No case of Diphtheria was notified during the year. C (4). Smallpox. An arrangement existed between the London County Council and the Erith Borough Council for accommodation for cases occurring within the district but the smallpox hospitals were taken over by the Regional Hospital Boards on the appointed day. C (5). Disinfection of premises after Infectious Disease. Following; the removal of aases of infectious disease, tuberculosis, etc. premises were disinfected, whilst enquiries to obtain particulars regarding 62 cases of tuberculosis were undertaken. The Council have a steam disinfector at the Isolation Hospital, at which clothing, bedding, etc. are disinfected. C (6). Laboratory Facilities. Examination of pathological specimens, and other laboratory work, for the district, are undertaken by the County Laboratories, County Hall, Maidstone. C (7). TUBERCULOSIS. (a) Treatment and Hospital Accommodation. The Kent County Council are responsible for cases of Tuberculosis occurring within the district, and also for Sanatorium treatment and hospital accommodation for Erith residents. A dispensary is held weekly at 65, Bexley Road, Erith, by a whole-time Tuberculosis Officer. In the tables which follow, particulars of new cases of Tuberculosis and of all deaths from the disease in the area, during 1948 are shown in Table 1, whilst Table 2 shows) the quarterly statements of cases on the register, together with the position at the 31st December, 1948. 23 C (7)b.

REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. The method of storage is by means of sanitary dustbins, and some 15,000 are emptied weekly. The dustbins are provided and maintained by the owners of the properties concerned, the Council securing this by a local act—the Erith Improvement Act, 1920. Disposal is effected by barging under contract, and these arrangements are still working very satisfactorily. E (1)a. Costs. £ s. d.

The charges made in connection with the above service amounted to £53 7s. 6d. E (5)d. Offensive Trades. In addition to the ordinary statutory offensive trades which are specified in Section 107 Public Health Act 1936, fish frying was declared to be an offensive trade on 17th March, 1939 and bye-laws were made accordingly. Within the Borough, there are no offensive trades other than those of fish frying, and of these premises, there are 14. E (5)e. Closet accommodation and cesspools. The whole of the closet accommodation both in the older parts of the town and recently developed areas is on the main drainage system, there being only 24 known cesspools existing. During the year, one cesspool has been abandoned, and the drainage connected to the main sewer. Cesspools are emptied once a month free of charge by plant belonging to the Council, and the contents thereof are discharged into the nearest Council sewer. The cesspools which require the service of the Council are scattered throughout the district, and, in the majority of cases necessitate the covering of considerable distances both for pumping out and conveying to the point of discharge. During the year 1948, cesspools were emptied on 28 occasions. E (5)f. Smoke Abatement. No black smoke nuisances have come to the notice of the Department during the year. An improvement effected during the year included the provision of 2 twin screw underfeed mechanical stokers, and 1 single screw underfeed appliance. On 4th March, it was observed that a heavy grey dust deposit was prevailing in the district, and on investigation it was concluded that such nuisance was not arising from any source within the Borough. Further investigation revealed the penetration of dust into the district from the East which apparently was accelerated by strong easterly wind, and accompanied by intermittent fog. On the wind resuming the prevailing direction of South-west, the nuisance abated. 30 E (5)g. Swimming Baths and Pools. (1) The Council's open air bath is situated in Stonewood Road, and comprises one swimming pool of some 55,000 gallons capacity. During the year extensive repairs have been carried out on the pool which is now exclusively used by the County Education Authority during school hours. Water in the pool is heated to a temperature of 72 degrees Farenheit by low pressure steam heating and is sterilised by the Chlorine process. There is a slipper establishment with accommodation for 16 males and 4 females. Adjacent to the public bath is a mechanical laundry which launders on behalf of undertakings including Catering Dept., Works Dept., and County Health and Education Authority and during the year 71,000 articles were dealt with. (2) A childrens' paddling pool of some 60,000 gallons capacity is situated within the Belvedere Recreation ground. This pool is regularly emptied and cleansed, and during the summer months, the water is methodically dosed with Chloros. E (5)h. Camping sites. There are no summer camping sites within the Borough. There are however 4 sites which have been occupied by vans which are owned by house-holders for a number of years. Frequent inspections have been made with a view to the application of Bye-law requirements. In one instance it was found that land not licenced was being occupied by Caravans, and application was duly made to the Police Court for the requisite proceedings provided for by Section 269, Public Health Act, 1936. On the day of the hearing at the Police Court, the ground had been evacuated in consequence of which, the Summons was withdrawn. E (5)i. Hop pickers. There are no hop fields within the district. E (5)j. Rag Flock Act. No premises exist in the Borough in which rag flock is manufactured or sold. E (5)k. Eradication of Bed bugs. During the year 1948, dwellinghouses found to be infested with vermin and subsequently disinfested as under:— Privately owned houses 24 Council houses 9 31 Disinfestation of both privately owned houses and Council houses is carried out by operatives under the supervision of Sanitary Inspectors, presence of vermin being located by the Sanitary Inspectors whilst carrying out their inspections. With regard to privately owned property, owners and occupiers are encouraged to report infestations in which case every assistance is given to cope with the menace, and for an appropriate charge, the operative carries out the necessary destruction. Close co-operation exists between the Housing Department and the Sanitary Inspectors, in which case successful disinfestation is promptly carried out, and in the case of transfers, it is sometimes found so necessary for the tenant to surrender certain household articles for destruction. Materials used for disinfestation are based on solutions of D.D.T., and latterly, Gammexane. E (5)1. Cleansing of verminous persons. During the year, persons suffering from Scabies have been directed to the Cleansing station administered by the Borough of Bexley with which Authority an agreement has existed for such treatment to be carried out. E (5)m. Mosquito Control. During the year, there was no obvious mosquito nuisance, principally due no doubt to the temperate summer climate. As usual however, the necessary precautions were taken which included the spraying of the many water courses and reservoirs such as pools and allotment tanks situated within the area. Such spraying operated from April to September. The 275 pig salvage bins on the streets were similarly treated. E (5)n. Rodent control. Much good work has been carried out with regard to the destruction of rats and mice. Provisions of Circular N.S. 19 were accepted by the Local Authority, whereby all grants and conditions thereto in force at 31st March, 1948 were terminated, and superseded by a consolidated grant of 50% of the approved net expenditure incurred by the Local Authority during the year ending 31st March, 1949. To rank for this grant, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries deemed it necessary for the Local Authority to undertake that two operatives be employed on rodent destruction whole time. As in the previous years, the Council's sewers have been effectively treated for sewer rat during the months of March and September. 32 During the period 19th to 23rd July, a film display sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was held at Electricity House. This show also embraced the activities of the Colorado beetle and was most successful, in that 1,307 persons attended and obtained much information with regard to rodent destruction. HOUSING. E (6)a.

The Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restriction) Act, 1939. The provisions regarding extortionate rents, etc. are administered by the Senior Sanitary Inspector and during the year 1948, 88 applicants sought advice and assistance. The maximum rent of houses brought under control by this act is the rent payable at 2nd. September, 1939, subject to certain permitted increases which are provided for by the act. There is, however, no provision for de-control on vacant possession by the landlord. 34 Appended below is a summary of the improvements effected: (a) Rent reduced from £18 15s. Od. per quarter to £13 per quarter. (b) Rent reduced from 12/6 per week to 10/9 and £1 Is. 6d. returned to tenant.

E (7)c. Offices. In no instance was it necessary to take action under Section 46 Public Health Act 1936 in respect to sanitary accommodation at offices, no case having been found this year when insufficient accommodation exists. SECTION F.—WATER SUPPLY—MILK AND FOOD AND DRUGS. F (1). Water Supply. The water in this district is almost exclusively supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water though possessing a considerable degree of hardness, is of good quality and is palatable. The supply is led direct into the dwellings served, no standpipes being known to exist. Routine examinations of such supplies have been undertaken throughout the year with completely satisfactory results, and arrangements exist with the Kent County Council for 2 samples of this supply to be submitted to the Laboratory monthly for bacteriological examination.

The above Act makes the use of mechanically operated instruments a statutory obligation. By resolution of the Council dated 23rd May, 1938, the provisions of Section 1 of the Act apply to sheep which are slaughtered in the district. F (5). FOOD HYGIENE CAMPAIGN. In view of the recent national interest in food hygiene it was decided during the summer to organise a Food Hygiene Campaign in Erith. Tests were carried out in restaurants run by the ‘Borough Catering’ service and at other typical cafes in the district. 39 Particular attention was paid to the cleanliness of the food utensils, the condition of the washing-up water and the possibility of the spread of disease via these media. Broadly the method adopted was to take two sets of samples of washing-up water, swabs of utensils, crockery, etc. at various stages.
