The urban District Council of Action. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER for the year 1899. To the Chairman and Members of the Acton District Council. Gentlemen, MANY measures of sanitary importance have occupied your attention during the year. The Plans for the Isolation Hospital have been forwarded to the Local Government Board for approval, so there is a reasonable hope that this much needed Institution will soon be in evidence. Permission to raise a loan for the erection of a Destructor Furnace has been granted. A New Mortuary is shortly to be built. Several Dust Carts and Waggons have been purchased. The carts are tipped by mechanical means, are covered with special covers of iron and have a capacity of 3 cubic yards for carts and 3½ cubic yards for the waggons. The carts are of very great improvement on the old ones used by the late contractor, and will be a means of improving the health of the district. The question of building dwellings for the working classes has also been discussed. 4 I regret that forty-six cases of Enteric Fever were reported during the year, but one must not lose sight of the fact that Enteric Fever was generally universal, and that instances are recorded of outbreaks after a hot and dry summer followed by much rain, both of which climatic conditions we experienced. In this report I have fully discussed the disease, and the measures which should be employed to prevent it. I am pleased to again record a lowered Death Rate, which when we consider the large Infant population, is satisfactory. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, G. A. GARRY SIMPSON. s POPULATION. The number of occupied houses in the Parish in the middle of 1899 amounted to 5,614, and the number of occupants to each house averaged about six; the population estimated in this way would be 33.684. The above computation is about correct, and is selected in this report for the purpose of drawing out the mortality-rates of the Parish. The following table shows the number of the population and inhabited houses at the four preceding censusefs;— Year. Inhabited Houses.

BIRTHS. During the year 1899 there were 1,068 births registered in the Parish: of these 535 were males, and 533 were females. The birthrate per 1,000 persons living was therefore 317. 6 The following table shows the Births since 1890:— Year. Number of Births. 1890. 704 1891. 772 1892. 763 1893. 831 1894. 834 1895. 874 1896. 894 1897. 973 1898. 995 1899. 1,068 Birth-rate for London 29.4 per 1,000 persons living. MORTALITY. General Mortality.—There were 509 deaths registered. The recorded general death rate is therefore 15.1 per 1,000, as against i5.8 in 1898 and i5.9 in 1897. The London death-rate was 19.8 per 1,000 living. Death-rates vary according to the nature of the population of the respective districts; for instance, in a district containing a large number of very young or very old people, the death-rate would be considerably higher than in a district consisting of middle-aged people. Taking into consideration the number of children in the parish, we have in comparison with other districts a low death-rate. Senile Mortality— Of the 509 deaths 91 were of persons over 65 years of age, 36 over 70 years of age, 16 over 80 years, and 3 over 90 years. The mean age at death of 56 Inhabitants was 78 years. These figures denote an exceptionally high proportion of deaths from Senile decay. 7 Infantile Mortality—There were 200 deaths registered of Infants under 1 year of age, as against 1,068 births; the proportion which the deaths under 1 year of age bear to 1,000 births is, therefore, 187.2 as against 181.9 in the preceding year. Prior to the commencement of the fourth quarter of 1899, the deaths of children under one year were below the average for the preceding year, but the mortality from diarrhœa caused an unexpected rise. Summer diarrhoea must be thought of as something quite apart from the diarrhoea which figures as a cause of death all the year round. There are sufficient reasons for believing that the essential cause of the complaint resides in the soil, from which it issues under favourable meteorological conditions (more especially of temperature) to gain access to air, water, and food. It is especially important, therefore, in the summer months to take every possible means of ensuring the freedom of these necessities of life from contamination. Infants fed artificially for the first nine months of life, suffer much more from the complaint than those fed naturally from the mother's breast, and where such artificial feeding is necessary, very much mortality would be prevented if parents would give nothing but well boiled diluted cows' milk for the first nine months of life, and by keeping all milk vessels and feeding bottles scrupulously clean. For the neglect of these simple precautions, the infants of these islands alone are paying a yearly toll of many thousands of deaths. An increasing and distinctly preventable cause of Infantile Mortality is from overlaying or from suffocation in bed. I am pleased to state that no inquests were held during the year on "overlaid "children, which is a record for this parish as far as I can ascertain. The Coroner writes to me "They used to be of frequent occurrence, and never a year has passed without 3 or 4 such cases." In England the number of deaths from overlaying steadily increases, the highest on record being (or 1896, when they reached 1,941; of these 1,740 were under one year of age. Nearly every coroner, at all events in London, has lamented this increase, and has stated that the deaths were largely preventable. As they mainly take place on Saturday night (two to three times as many as on other nights), the stupefaction of drink must be held largely accountable for the mothers' carelessness; Monday is the next worst. The rate of deaths from suffocation in bed has steadily increased from 130 per million births in 1881 to 174 in 1890, and is now even higher than that. That this black list might easily be abolished is proved by the experience of Germany, where, though infantile mortality as a whole is high, this particular form of death has now been almost abolished, since it renders the parent liable to a fine; drunkenness being no excuse, as it is with us, for the child's death, but rather an aggravation. In AustroHungary also parents are forbidden to have infants in bed with themselves. In my health addresses I fully enter into the subject, and give simple instructions to the mothers, with so far very satisfactory results. MEANS EMPLOYED FOR LOWERING THE INFANT MORTALITY. (a) The following Leaflet is given to each person registering a birth, by the Registrar. THE DISTRICT COUNCIL OF ACTON. IMPORTANT ADVICE TO PARENTS. 1. For the first seven or eight months of life the Infants' Food should be restricted to Mother's Milk, which is the natural food. Starchy foods, such as Potatoes, Sago, Tapioca, Rice, Bread, Biscuits, &c., must on no account be given, as the juices for digesting them are not formed till the seventh or eighth month when the teeth begin to appear. 9 2. If the infant be brought up by hand, cow's milk, previously boiled and properly diluted should be given. For the first two months give twice as much water as milk. From two to three months give equal parts of milk and water. From three to six months give one third part water. Each bottle should be sweetened with a little sugar. 3. The amount of food to be given at each meal and the intervals between meals, should be as follows:- Age. Interval of Feeding. Average Amount at each Feeding. Average Amount in 24 hours. 1st week 2 hours 1 ounce 10 ounces 1st to 6th week 2½ ,, 1½ to 2 „ 12 to 16 „ 6th to 12th week and possibly to 5 th or 6th month 3 ,, 3 to 4 ,, 18 to 24 „ At 6 months 3 ,, 6 „ 36 ,, At 10 months 3 ,, 8 „ 40 „ Note—One ounce is equal to two tablespoonfuls. 4. When eight month's old, a healthy baby may be allowed, in addition to the milk diet, a little boiled bread and milk, rusks soaked in milk, yolk of egg and milk, beef tea, mutton broth (½1b. of the meat to a pint of water), fine oatmeal, Mellin's or Benger's Food, Wheaten flour, Savory & Moore's Food, Allen & Hanbury's Food. Never give Wine, Beer, Spirits, Tea or Coffee, Cake or Sweets. 5. Condensed Milk is never so good for infants as fresh milk, but if it is used at all it must be Condensed Whole Milk. Never give 10 condensed milk to an infant from a tin which has the words "skimmed" or "separated" upon the label, for such milk has been robbed of nutriment, and a child cannot thrive on it, however much is taken. 6. Feeding bottles should be kept very clean, the best form is the boat shaped bottle with a short teat; don't use the bottle with a long india-rubber tube. Two bottles should be used alternately, they should be placed in boiling water after use along with the teat or tube attached to them. Neglect of this precaution is responsible for hundreds of deaths each year from Diarrhoea. 7. A flannel bandage should be worn round the stomach and abdomeu next to the skin. The band should be sufficiently wide to cover the whole belly from the hips to the waist, and long enough to go twice round the body. 8. Healthy Infants should be taken into the fresh air whenever the weather permits. THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. B. The free distribution of leaflets on Measles, during the spring. I have now done this for three successive years, and for the first time on record there was not a single death attributed to this complaint. C. Health Lectures at Mothers' Meetings. I have been convinced for some years that the only way to lower Infant Mortality is by educating the Mothers by Leaflets and Health addresses on Infant Feeding and Home Hygiene. During 1899,1 gave nine lectures, and had an average attendance of 50 women to each lecture. At Christmas an examination was held, and prizes given to the three most successful candidates. I was most encouraged by the results of these addresses, and shall hope to continue them during the coming autumn and winter months. 11 The following table compares the death-rate of children under one year per 1,000 registered births, and the birth-rate for the last thirteen years:— Birth-rate per Thousand.

During the year 22 bodies were deposited in the Public Mortuary; of these 14 were males and 8 were females. Post Mortem examinations were performed upon 14 of these cases, and 20 inquests held. The Zymotic death-rate for the year was 2.5 per 1,ooo of the population. In the following table the death-rate and Zymotic death-rate are so arranged that comparison can be made for the last twelve years:— 1888 1 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 Small Pox — — — — — — — — — — — — Measles 1 25 11 9 24 2 15 6 24 2 6 — Scarlet Fever 2 1 3 4 — 10 3 3 i — 3 2 Diptheria 2 8 7 2 4 2 5 5 8 28 8 7 Whooping Cough 9 13 3 6 25 5 17 5 21 — 10 14 Typhoid Fever — 1 1 — 3 4 2 2 2 2 — 7 Diarrhoea and Dysentery 10 12 18 24 34 60 17 44 37 80 50 56 Puerperal Fever — — — 1 6 4 2 — — 1 — Total number of deaths from seven Zymotic Diseases 14 60 43 4S 91 89 63 67 93 130 78 86 Deaths from other causes J 282 377 298 368 334 396 330 411 370 373 439 423 Total Deaths 306 437 34 1 413 425 486 393 48 464 503 517 509 Death-rate from seven Zymotic Diseases per thousand 1.9 2.8 1.9 1.8 3.6 3.4 2.2 2.4 3.1 4.1 2.3 2.5 Death-rate from other causes per thousand 7 12.9 161 12.o 15.3 13.4 15.2 12 14.8 12.6 11.8 13.5 12.6 General death. rate per thousand 13.99 18.9 13.9 17.1 17 18.6 14.2 17.2 15.7 15.9 15.8 15.1 In London the Zymotic death-rate was 2.48 per 1,000. 13 INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THE MEASURES TAKEN TO PREVENT THEIR SPREAD. It will be seen from the following table that 239 notification certificates of Infectious Illness were received from medical practitioners, as against 234 during the preceding year. In most instances disinfection was performed by the Sanitary Authority, and in other cases by the householders, to the satisfaction of their medical attendant. A visit was paid to every house; thus, apart from the measures that have been taken to prevent the spread of infectious illness, the notification of such illness was the means during the year of bringing about a sanitary inspection of various premises. The following table gives the number reported each year since the Act came into force. 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 Small Pox — — 13 7 2 — — — — — Scarlet Fever 108 63 74 192 86 67 193 93 167 111 Diphtheria 14 8 27 41 22 32 23 89 35 49 Membranous Croup 4 — 13 1 — — — 4 — — Typhoid Fever 13 13 15 19 15 28 14 10 9 46 Continued Fever — — — 1 — — — — — — Puerperal Fever 1 — 1 2 1 3 3 — 1 — Erysipelas 22 18 37 77 41 31 26 25 22 31 162 102 180 340 167 161 259 221 234 239 DISINFECTION. The employment of sulphurous acid for the surface disinfection of rooms is still employed, but I take this opportunity of informing you that I shall shortly advise the use of Formic Aldehyde. There are no greater difficulties or inconveniences attending its use than those which apply to the use of Sulphurous Acid, and it possesses the great advantages that it is more certain in its disinfectant action and does not injure any article of furniture or ornamentation exposed to it. All bedding &c. is disinfected by super-heated steam as before. 14 HOSPITAL ISOLATION. The following patients were admitted into the Willesden Isolation Hospital during 1899:— NAME. ADMITTED. DISCHARGED. AMOUNT CHARGED FOR MAINTENANCE L. W. Jan. 27, 1899 Mar. 27, 1899 £ s. d. 26 ii 0 H. P. April 10, ,, June 1, „ 23 8 0 F. S. May 25, ,, July 13, „ 22 1 0 W. B.

Sept. 27, „ Dec. 7, „ 31 19 0 £140 8 0 In addition five patients suffering from Enteric Fever were treated in the Acton Cottage Hospital, four at the West London Hospital, Hammersmith, and one at Isleworth. One patient convalescent from Scarlet Fever was sent to the Mary Wardell Home, Stanmore, during the year. Four little patients were taken at a moment's notice to the West London Hospital, suffering from Diphtheria. Such cases as these give great anxiety. One is suddenly called, often late at night, to find a child dying from laryngeal obstruction due generally to Diphtheritic Membrane; to save the child's life the operation of Tracheotomy has to be performed without delay, yet to attempt the operation without skilled nursing and proper surroundings is fatal. The West London Hospital has kindly come to my aid, often opening a ward specially for the patient. Three patients recovered out of four on whom the operation of Tracheotomy was performed, although two had practically stopped breathing on arrival at the hospital. Cases such as the above point to the great want of an Infectious Hospital. 15 SICK NURSING. The importance of good nursing in the treatment of disease can scarcely be exaggerated, and a great work has been done by the nurses in connection with our Cottage Hospital. They have had under treatmen 265 patients and paid no less than 5,473 visits. Nurse Dawkins has paid 1,090 visits, nursed 18 cases of Scarlet Fever, 16 of Diphtheria, and 13 of Enteric. She has given out 609 bottles of disinfectant, and superintended the removal of 14 patients to various Hospitals. She has also in her spare moments delivered about 800 Leaflets on Measles and Infant Feeding, &c. SCARLET FEVER. One hundred and thirteen cases were notified against 167 in 1898. There were only two deaths. It is important that no children should be allowed to return to school for some little time after desquamation has ceased, as the micro-organism that causes the disease, remains in the throat sometime after apparent convalescence. DIPHTHERIA. Forty-nine cases were notified aganist 35 in 1898. There were seven deaths. Most of the Medical Practitioners avail themselves of the Diphtheria Antitoxine which I always keep ready for immediate use. The following statistics should convince the most sceptical as to the value of the Antitoxine treatment. MORTALITY STATISTICS OF THE CITY OF PARIS, from 1894 to 1898. 1894 1,008 deaths. 1895 Diphtheria Antitoxine used 423 „ 1896 „ „ 454 „ 1897 „ „ 301 „ 1898 „ „ 255 „ 16 The above figures justify the regular employment of antitoxine. Yet hundreds of poor children in London die of Diphtheria, who have never had the benefit of this remedy. The default is sometimes due to the fact that the medical practitioner is not convinced as to the value of the agent. There can be no gainsaying that the continued prevalence of this disease is determined to some extent by school attendance. The Medical Officer of Health (Mr. Shirley Murphy), of the London County Council, has placed the matter upon a solid statistical foundation. He has shown that the increase in Diphtheria has mainly affected the ages 3—10, and that the relative increase of the mortality at the ages 3—10 commenced with the operations of the Elementary Education Act of 1870. The effect which the closing of the schools during vacation periods has in reducing the incidence of the disease is also susceptible of statistical demonstration. In view of these facts, and seeing the part schools play in the dissemination of other infections, the precautions taken in the interest of the scholars are in my opinion unsatisfactory. The Medical Officer of Health should be kept promptly posted up as to those who are absent through illness; he should possess the power of examining any scholar or scholars at any time when he has reason to think such action desirable in the public interest; and he should also have the power of arranging for a medical inspection of all the scholars, when he considers such a step advisable. Short of the adoption of these measures compulsory education will continue to be linked in some measure with compulsory disease. Medical Officers of Health have been for some time pressing for such powers, but they can only be granted by Act of Parliament. TYPHOID FEVER. The immunity which we have hitherto experienced from this disease was unfortunately broken during the year. 57 Forty-six cases were notified and there were seven deaths. As I have already fully reported the result of my investigations, I need not repeat the matter. A report also went to the Local Government Board. The Nature and Causes of Typhoid Fever. At the present time between 30,000 and 50,000 people suffer from typhoid fever every year, and between 5,000 and 6,000 people die from it in England and Wales alone. And yet typhoid fever is pre-eminently a preventable disease. If we were to make full and proper use of the knowledge which we have gained with regard to the causes of typhoid fever, and the means of preventing it, we might—in England and Wales— save nearly 5,000 lives a year, and prevent the prolonged sickness and suffering of some 30,000 to 50,000 individuals. In fact, we might in time exterminate the disease altogether. Typhoid fever—according to our best Authorities—is caused by living creatures named typhoid bacilli: creatures so small that they can be seen only with the most powerful microscopes; so small that millions of them may be crowded together into a few drops of fluid, or a few grains of soil. From a patient suffering from typhoid fever the typhoid bacilli are given off in countless myriads; chiefly in the discharges from the bowels, but also in the urine. If these bacilli are allowed to find their way into the .surroundings or the food of man—such as the soil, or water or milk,— they can multiply with marvellous rapidity. If they, again, find entrance into the body of man they can multiply in the same way, and produce the disease which we know as typhoid or enteric fever. 18 Ways in which Typhoid Fever may be Conveyed. The bacilli may be conveyed from the patient to other individuals in various ways:— (1) Through the handling of the body, clothing, bedding, utensils, or other things which have been polluted with the discharges of the typhoid fever patient. (2) Through the air coming either from drains,cesspits and other deposits which have been contaminated with the discharges from typhoid fever patients, or from soil so contaminated. (3) Through ordinary food (especially drinking water and milk), which has been exposed to air contaminated in the ways mentioned above; or has been directly polluted by deposits, leaking cesspits, sewers, drains, &c., containing discharges from typhoid fever patients. The poison of typhoid fever is also sometimes conveyed through ices, and probably through watercress, and various other food materials which have been in contact with polluted water, and have not been cooked before being eaten. Prevention of Typhoid Fever. DUTIES OF THE NURSE. The honour and the responsibility of holding and guarding the first line of defence against invasion by typhoid fever belongs to our nurses. When the living typhoid bacilli, contained in the discharges and urine of a typhoid fever patient, have once been allowed to escape into the outer world it becomes almost impossible to detect them again, or to learn what becomes of them; whilst the difficulty of protecting human beings and their surroundings from them becomes increased to an incalculable extent. It is the duty of every nurse to recognise the great responsibility incurred in nursing a typhoid fever patient, to realise the power which she possesses, and to neglect 110 precaution by which she may kill the living poison before it can escape. 19 Difficulties of Thorough Disinfection. In the process of disinfection it must be remembered that the object is to destroy all traces of the living poison. When heat is applied as a disinfectant, every article of the poison should be heated to the required temperature. Consequently linen, or solids, or liquids containing any solid articles should be boiled for at least half an hour; since it takes some time to raise the temperature of every part of the linen or solid particle up to that of the boiling water. When disinfecting solutions are used, the solution must be of sufficient strength and must be applied for sufficient time to ensure complete destruction of all the living bacilli. For this reason it is necessary to soak infected linen for at least four hours in the disinfecting solution, since the solution does not penetrate the whole of the linen for a considerable time. For the same reason it is necessary to soak discharges from the bowel, containing even small particles, with the disinfecting solution for at least three hours before emptying these discharges into the drain. Any solid lumps in the discharges should be broken up and well mixed with the disinfecting solution : for which purpose two pieces of stick may be used ; and these pieces should be burnt immediately after being used. Thorough disinfection of the hands is extremely difficult. It is not sufficient merely to dip them in disinfecting solution. In addition to this the hands, and more especially the spaces under the nails, must be thoroughly scrubbed with soap and water. TUBERCULOSIS. Forty deaths were attributed to Phthisis or Tuberculosis. This disease which causes the tremendous mortality of 60,000 per annnm in England and Wales is very largely preventable, and attention has been drawn to the urgent necessity which exists for adopting measures that are calculated to diminish this appalling waste of health and life and the misery and expense which it entails. 20 The expectoration of patients suffering from consumption is loaded with the germs of the disease, and when this dries it mingles with the dirt of the compartment, gets lifted up by air currents, and if inhaled by a susceptible individual he probably falls a victim to the complaint. Unboiled milk is another fertile source of Infection, as from 40-50 per cent. of milk cows suffer from Consumption. In my annual report for 1898 I entered fully into the subject, but I take this opportunity of suggesting that the following measures be sanctioned by the District Council, with a view of preventing the spread of consumption through the infection derived from previous human sufferers. (1). That all the medical practitioners in Acton be informed that the District Council is prepared, on application, to disinfect (free of charge) all rooms which have been occupied by patients suffering from consumption immediately upon such rooms ceasing to be occupied. (2). That whenever a death from tubercular disease is certified in the parish a visit shall be paid to the house in which the death occurred and an offer made to disinfect free of cost. (3). That handbills of information as to the nature of the disease, the ways in which it may be contracted, the necessity for the adoption of certain precautions, and the willingness of the District Council to undertake gratuitous disinfection, be sent to the ministers of religion, district visitors, school teachers, etc., with a request that they will circulate these as opportunites present themselves. MEASLES. There were no deaths from Measles during the year, which is a record according to these reports. 21 WATER SUPPLY An analysis of the water supply was made at regular intervals. DRAINAGE. Sewers laid during the year:— Park Road East about 187 yards. Park Road North „ 120 „ Osborne Road ,, 144 „ Across Acton Green,, 133 „ Several estates have been opened up, Roads formed and sewers laid, viz.: Acton Green Estate about 3,000 yards.
