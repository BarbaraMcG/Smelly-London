Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen— I beg to submit my ninth annual report. Some years are, of course, less healthy than others, and the climatic conditions of 1909 were depressing, and not salubrious. Our records, however, show continued improvement, not only when comparisons are made with those of past years, but when comparisons are made with those of districts similar to our own. I trust that this result will be held to justify the many and important steps which you have directed or sanctioned. 1 am, Gentlemen, Obediently yours, F. G. CROOKSHANK. The Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Barnes. 9 SUMMARY.

Greater changes, however, took place in Mortlake than in Barnes; and there is no doubt now that the population of the former parish exceeds that of the latter by at least 2,000. The number of houses actually occupied in Mortlake at Midsummer of 1909 was 3,147; the figures for Barnes were 2,745. It is true that the average number of persons per house is probably becoming less in Mortlake than formerly, but, on the other hand, owing to the "development" of certain estates in the second half of the year, the figures 3,147 do not represent a true mean. The outbreak of maisonnettes and double tenements in the district has certainly shown signs of subsidence lately, and it is interesting to note a distinct improvement in the design of the smaller houses now chiefly in favour. In my report for 1902 I made some allusion to the wastefulness and folly of providing two living-rooms in workmen's cottages. The point is now generally recognized, and, even in houses of a grade above these, one meets with the combined kitchen and sitting room of good size in place of a cramped dining room and totally inadequate kitchen, and there is on the whole a tendency to increase the size of the bedrooms provided. On the other hand, the tendency is to occupy smaller houses than was the custom 20 years ago. Of course there are several explanations of this change: One is that with smaller families fewer rooms are required; another is that more money is spent on "pleasure" and less at the dictates of "house-pride" than formerly. 12 A third is that owing to the increased cost of materials, &c., and the higher standard of luxury desired, a given rent will not secure so large or roomy a house as heretofore. Again, the wage earner travels increased and increasing distances, and so relatively less money is available for rent. The desire to live where there are green fields and open spaces is a most laudable one; but, under present conditions, its fulfilment leads to its frustration, for as soon as houses are built the fair conditions which led to their erection vanish. In fact, the growth of houses around London, with the dreary areas of decaying intermediate suburbs, reminds one forcibly of the progress of those pathological formations which invade healthy regions and leave behind them a track of atrophy or decay. In districts such as this the permanence of our Parks and Commons is an asset of incalculable value, but still the most vigorous action possible under the Housing and Town Planning Act is called for ere it be yet too late. Reference has been repeatedly made in these reports to the state of some of our older dwellings, and notably those of the Malthouse Area. In May, 1909, a public enquiry was held at the Council House into the representations made concerning this area, and communications from the Local Government Board have since been received. A sub-committee is at present earnestly at work on the matter, and 1 am sanguine that next year it may be reported that practical steps have been taken. The condition of other parts of the district has not however escaped attention ; substantial repairs are now being carried out 13 in a part of Hampton Square, after the condemnation of eight houses therein, and the tables on pp. 55, 56 and 57, give details of work carried out in other streets and places. One may express the hope that the remarkable results accruing from the Westfields improvements will lead to similar improvements being made in Lilian, Fanny, and Glentham Roads—the lowest lying parts of the district; and that some amelioration may be effected at Littleworth End ; in the curious congeries of buildings behind Mortlake High Street; in Lifford's Place; in Jones' Yard, and elsewhere. In my opinion, however, the proper paving, channelling, &c., of White Hart Lane, now an important artery of communication and a considerable marketing centre, is absolutely imperative, and should not be longer delayed. The Water Supply of the district is quite satisfactory, and does not call for comment this year. Reference should, however, be made to Pale Well and to Beverley Brook. Pale Well should be cleansed and kept properly in order, lest it become a nuisance. The Beverley Brook, with its tributaries and ditches, ought also to be cleansed, and kept cleansed. No doubt in course of time some communications on the subject will pass between the Council and the Port of London Authority. During 1909 a boy who had drunk water from the Brook developed Typhoid Fever, and was admitted to the Hospital. 14 Milk and Food Supply. There is, I am glad to say, continued improvement in the condition of the dairies and places where milk is sold in the district. Greater powers are, however, urgently called for, and premises ought not to be registered for the sale or storage of milk unless defined conditions are first complied with. Great trouble has been taken to protect the health of the few adults who are employed in underground bakehouses, but we have really little power to protect the community from dirt infection of milk. Anxiety is always manifested at the possibility of the accidental and occasional dissemination of specific infection by milk, yet there is curious apathy concerning the almost constant distribution of microscopic dirt. An instance of the accidental dissemination of a specific infection by milk is referred to in the section of this report which deals with infectious disease. It should be stated that the occurrence, which affected both Wandsworth and this district, was not in any way due to local conditions, and could not have been prevented by local action. It may, however, be justly claimed that it was by local action that the facts were ascertained at the earliest possible moment, and that what might have been a very serious affair was brought to an end speedily without loss of life. Premises where food other than milk is prepared, stored, or exposed for sale, and the articles of food therein, are kept under frequent observation. In one case the preparation of ham, beef, &c., for sale was found to be carried on under very unsatisfactory conditions, but on my intervention drastic changes were at once made by the owner. 15 Most of the meat sold in the district comes from the Central Meat Market, and has therefore been already carefully examined. Very rarely, indeed, is anything found wrong with meat so procured. Some meat, however, is brought from a neighbouring district, and is less satisfactory. There are three slaughter-houses in the district, and Mr. Robinson, the Assistant Inspector, who is specially trained in food inspection, is usually present on killing days. One carcase was during the year found to be tuberculous, and was at once destroyed. On several occasions during the year, livers, joints, &c., have been destroyed immediately at the request of one or other inspector. There are 18 eating-houses, and two places where ice cream is prepared in the district. These are frequently inspected. The report of Mr. Houghton, the County Inspector under the Food and Drugs Act, who doubtless gives as much time to this district as his very large area of work allows, is given on page 49. The Sewerage and Drainage of the District was referred to in detail in my report for 1908, and in that for 1905 a plan was given which shows the chief lines of our system. During 1909 very little sewerage work of consequence was carried out, other than that of course necessitated by the opening up of new roads by builders. As will, however, be seen on reference to the table given on page 56, in 67 cases defective drains were amended, and in 18 reconstruction was carried out. It was possible during 1909 to give much more time than formerly to systematic drain testing. 16 The Disposal of House Refuse is still conducted on the lines which have now obtained for some years, and complaints from persons residing in the new houses near to the dock at which the carts tip their contents into the barges are of frequent occurrence. The question of the provision of a dust destructor has again, as for some years past, engaged the earnest attention of the Council, but no conclusion has so far been determined on. I understand that a new process, by which house refuse is rapidly converted into an inoffensive dry powder, has lately obtained favourable comment. So far as my information goes, the process is an excellent one, and suitable for this district. Earlier in the year some communications were made to the Richmond Borough Council, as it was thought that possibly that Authority might favourably consider a plan for the erection of a dust destructor under joint management near to the works of the Joint Sewerage Board. No progress, however, was made with the pourparlers. Trade refuse is now, I am glad to say, removed by the Council's scavengers by arrangement with those tradespeople who are willing. Complaints frequently reach the Sanitary Department from householders who are aggrieved by the deposition of rubbish in the secondary means of access to their houses. In some parts of the district there are quite long lanes, running between the back gardens of contiguous streets, which afford these secondary means of access, and it appears to be the general practice for householders to deposit dead leaves, the cuttings from lawns, &c., in these lanes, opposite their neighbours' gates. 17 It is not quite easy to find a remedy. The passages are private property, and the Council is not desirous of scavenging these unless the cost is duly apportioned under the P. H. Acts. All that the Sanitary Department can do, if any accumulation is found to be a nuisance, is to serve a notice for its removal on the person to whose house it is contiguous. Such person is usually the person aggrieved, and not the person who causes the nuisance to occur. The work undertaken with regard to Nuisances is summarized in tables given on pp. 56 and 57 by Mr. Grylls, to whoseexperience and tact the district has for so many years been indebted. It will be seen that the house-to-house inspections were slightly fewer than 1908, but that more work was done by way of house cleansing and disinfection, there having been more visits to houses in which notifiable disease occurred. No legal proceedings were taken, as in every case the defects were remedied, and in only 36 cases was it necessary to serve a Statutory Notice. No serious nuisances were complained of during 1909, and the general condition of the district is year by year rising to a higher level. It should be observed that the table on page 56 is not merely a record of the nuisances discovered, but of the nuisances abated. Bye-Laws. For some years past I have, in these reports, alluded to the desirability of some Bye-Law being adopted that would check the construction of double tenements with inordinate "back additions." Early in 1909 the matter was considered by the Council, and after a conference with officials of the Local Government Board, it 18 was decided that application should be made for confirmation of (i) an addition to Bye-Law 3 of the series made on May 10th, 1898, and (ii) a new Bye-Law. Confirmation has not yet been received, but it is hoped that such will shortly be the case. The proposed addition and new Bye-Law are as follows:— (i) Every person who shall erect a new domestic building of which any part projects in the rear from the main part of such building shall, in addition to the open space required to be provided in connection with such building by any Bye-Law in that behalf, provide on one side of such projecting part an open space, exclusively belonging to such building, which shall be free from any erection thereon above the level of the ground and shall extend laterally throughout the remaining width of such building and longitudinally throughout the entire length of such projecting part, and he shall cause the distance across the last mentioned open space from the side of such projecting part to the boundary of any lands or premises immediately opposite the side of such new domestic building to be not less in any case than 5 feet. If the height of such projecting part be not less than 15 feet, or the length not less than 25 feet, but the height be less than 25 feet and the length less than 25 feet, he shall cause such distance to be 7 feet 6 inches at the least, or, If the height of such projecting part be not less than 25 feet, or the length not less than 25 feet, but the height be less than 35 feet and the length less than 35 feet, he shall cause such distance to be 10 feet at the least. If the height of such projecting part be not less than 35 feet, or the length not less than 35 feet, he shall cause such distance to be 12 feet at the least. 19 (ii) That where a window shall be so constructed as to open into an enclosed court or area open only at the top to the external air, such window shall not be deemed to comply with the requirements of the Bye-Law, unless the distance across such court or area, measured from the opening of the wall in which such window is constructed to the opposite wall of such court or area, be equal at least to two-thirds the height measures from the height of the sill of such window to the level of eaves or top of the parapet of the opposite wall." Suggestions for various other amendments have been, from time to time, made by my colleagues and myself, and a committee is now sitting that has been appointed to consider and report on the whole question of the revision of the Building Bye-Laws. No lodging houses, and no offensive trades exist or are carried on in our district now. On November 13th, 1908, a Home Office Order was issued declaring the greater part of Section 81, the whole part of Section 85 (Registries for Servants), the whole part of Section 86 (Marine Stores, etc.), Part 8 and Part 9 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, to be in force in this district. The steps necessary to administer these enactments have been taken, and Bye-Laws under Section 8 have been made and confirmed. On October 29th, 1909, a Local Government Board Order was issued declaring that on and after December 10th, 1909, Part 2, Part 3, Sections 52—65 and 67—68 contained in Part 4, and Part 10, of the same Act, should be in force in this district, subject to certain conditions and adaptations duly scheduled. For some time past an ambulance, provided by subscription at the instance of Dr. R. D. Mackintosh, has been available in case of sickness or accident, and has been kept at the Council's depot. 20 Owing to the generosity of Dr. Mackintosh and the committee presided over by him, this excellent ambulance has been presented to the Council, and will be in future be maintained by them under Section 50 of the Act just referred to. The Officers of the Council have been directed to frame suggestions for regulating the use of the vehicle, which, under the new conditions, will no doubt be of even greater public benefit than heretofore. The Public Elementary Schools in the district were referred to, and their condition described, in my report for 1908. It will be sufficient now to state that the non-provided (National) schools at Mortlake have been considerably improved; that the new infants' (Council) school at Mortlake is completed and in use ; and that the new Council mixed school, close to the scavenging dock in Lonsdale Road, has also been completed. The playgrounds of these schools are not of impervious material, but are gravelled. During November a slight outbreak of diphtheria occurred at the Green Schools, Barnes, and a few scholars in one or two class-rooms were attacked. Considerable alarm was caused, and much attention given to the outbreak, owing to the fact that coincidently with the outbreak being known there was a failure of the water supply to the school. The first cases however had occurred several days before the failure of the water supply, which was found to be due to the breaking of a lead service pipe some distance away, by reason of the brittleness of age and the growth of trees. I understand that the condition of these schools, perhaps the best of the older buildings, is under consideration. The old-fashioned trough closets should certainly be abolished, and the cottage adjoining, used for residential purposes, should be otherwise employed. 21 As the Urban District of Barnes does not, as yet, enjoy autonomy in the matter of public elementary schools, the arrangements for medical inspection are in the hands of the County authorities, and are well carried out by the executive officer, Dr. Jones, Assistant County Medical Officer of Health, with whom we work in the admirable harmony desired by the Board of Education. The last memorandum of the Board of Education, on school closure and the exclusion of scholars, has of course raised some difficult technical points owing to the state of the law. But, while the actual systematic inspection is carried out for Barnes and Mortlake by the special medical examiners appointed by the Education Committee of the Surrey County Council to work under Dr. Jones, I continue gladly to carry on the somewhat thankless task of examining school attendance cases. Owing to an expression of opinion at the Mortlake Petty Sessional Court that medical evidence should always be forthcoming in cases of prosecution for non-attendance owing to dirt, vermin, &c., and the apparent reluctance of anyone or any authority to pay fees in respect of such evidence, a position of some difficulty was at one time reached. The difficulty was, however, resolved, and the activities of the excellent School Attendance Officer, Mr. Chambers, under the direction of his Committee, continue to exert an increasingly beneficent effect. An arrangement has also been arrived at between Dr. Jones and myself whereby the technical and legal difficulties indicated by the memorandum just referred to in respect of school closure on "educational" grounds, and the exclusion of particular children, are overcome. Happily, during the year school closure was only called for in the case of the outbreak at the Green Schools just alluded to. 22 Here a rather noteworthy sequence of events occurred. On the occurrence of two or three cases advantage was taken of the power to close a department only of the school. This was done because the existence of one or two carriers was suspected, and proved; and also in order that the classroom should be cleansed. Formerly of course no such action was possible. But the result was that panic set in, and we were practically forced to close the whole school, as the numbers were so depleted that work could not well be carried on. It would be a deplorable thing if the exercise of power to close a department, or to exclude the number of scholars making up a class, on the occurrence of a few cases, should, in future, thus lead to panic, and the closure of a whole school. Generally, the health of the scholars has been good; there was some measles early in the year, and some chicken-pox later. There has been no change in our methods of dealing with infectious disease during the year, and the cases which occurred will be dealt with on a subsequent page. At the Isolation Hospital a new and admirable ward block has been completed under Mr. Tomes' supervision, and is satisfactory in every way. It is proposed to use it chiefly for cases of diphtheria, and it contains, in addition to two wards of six beds each, two excellent single wards, one of which has been fitted specially for cases requiring operative treatment. The sanitary annexes to this block are of a particularly useful type, and the building has been well, though economically equipped on the same lines as the best type of surgical ward, with aseptic furniture and fittings. This is a point on which I am inclined to lay great stress. 23 The new mortuary is well fitted for its purpose, and the old mortuary has been thrown into the coach house, giving good accommodation to the new aseptic ambulance supplied by Messrs. Carter & Sons, and the old ambulance, now repaired and improved, and adapted for use, should it be necessary to remove patients at any time to the County Small Pox Hospital at Clandon. The old block at the Hospital is about to undergo some necessary alterations to the sanitary annexes, and then will be, no doubt, renovated throughout. The fowls kept at the Hospital continue to be a source of profit, and have provided over 2,000 eggs during the year, whilst 19 young birds have been killed for the food of the patients. Eighty eight cases were admitted during the year under review; of these 46 were cases of scarlet fever. All recovered, while there were 35 cases of diphtheria with 4 deaths. Of these cases, 6 had marked laryngeal symptoms on admission; one died suddenly after temporary improval; one, aged 7 months, died of broncho-pneumonia after successful intubation; two others recovered after intubation, and two without operation One of the successful cases of intubation was, on admission, just convalescent from measles and whooping cough, and had, in addition to faucial and laryngeal diphtheria, diphtheria of an unhealed wound after removal of the appendix. Two cases of very severe erysipelas, one case of puerperal septicaemia, and four cases of typhoid fever were admitted. During the last few years the accommodation available had, owing to the growth of the district and other causes, until the opening of the new block, fallen below a convenient standard. It was, therefore, a matter of considerable anxiety to prevent cross infections, etc., but the success of the arrangements which we were, after 1907, able to make, together with the unwearying assistance of 24 Miss Bellinger, were such as to somewhat modify the views formerly held by me of the methods whereby which spread of infection in isolation hospitals might be prevented. These modified views have been recently stated by me to a professional audience, and without going at length here into technical matters, I may say that I am convinced that by a proper ritual of asepsis the dangers attending the introduction of mixed cases, doubtful cases, and cases of mistaken diagnosis may be practically abolished, while at the same time, as we have proved, considerable economy in staffing can be secured. It is, however, absolutely essential for the success of this method that there should never be any diminution in the full amount of air space allotted to each patient, that the equipment of the wards should be kept up to a certain level, and that there should be a sufficient number of wards. If experience confirms these views, 1 believe it will be found that cases of infectious disease may be handled with greater boldness than formerly, and, what will perhaps be regarded as even more satisfactory, there may be a greater economy in the construction and administration of, at any rate small, isolation hospitals. There is no doubt, I think, but that greater attention should be paid to isolation hospitals than is now the case. It is a pity that there is no machinery for their official inspection, as is the case with asylums, workhouses and infirmaries ; and, though perhaps it is hardly within my province to make the suggestion, still there have been official enquiries into subjects of, perhaps, less importance to the community than the provision and management of these institutions. It is difficult to say which zymotic diseases, if any, will not, a generation hence, be treated by local authorities in specially equipped institutions directly descended from the contemned "fever hospitals" of to-day. 25 As is known, in this district the voluntary notification of cases of Tuberculosis has been practised for some years. But, during 1909 the order of the Local Government Board requiring the notification of such cases from Poor Law officials has of course been in force. During the year five cases were notified by private practitioners voluntarily, and fourteen cases were notified by the Poor Law authorities. Of course some of the latter cases were notified to us several times from different persons; the district medical officer, the relieving officer, the medical officer of the infirmary at Richmond, and so on. In every instance the premises inhabited or vacated by notified persons was visited; the appropriate leaflet of instruction left; the house carefully inspected and if necessary cleansed, and the rooms and contents disinfected at the proper time. The public are without doubt much more alive than formerly to the necessity of disinfection, and there is a growing appreciation of the advantage of free ventilation. In fact there is a greater tendency for phthisis to be classed with other infectious diseases, and I do not doubt that in time public opinion will demand its treatment with them. As a practising physician one cannot but be impressed with the increasingly good results that can be secured by even domestic treatment of tuberculosis, now that the public appreciate the advantages that follow early and confident diagnosis. It is hesitation in diagnosis that causes most loss of life from phthisis, and there is no excuse for it now that a definite opinion means bold and often successful treatment, 26 By referring to the table given on page 41, the number of cases of Infectious Disease notified during 1909 will be seen. The fifty-six cases of scarlet fever were scattered throughout the district, and few of the twenty occurring in Barnes had any obvious relation to each other. Of the thirty-six cases in Mortlake six arose in connection with a large educational establishment at Richmond attended by girls from this district. No cases were found in this district to have been related to the sharp outbreak of milk-borne scarlatina which, during the summer, affected a part of Surrey and South-West London. The forty-three cases of diphtheria were also, with the exception of the few already alluded to as affecting the Green Schools, apparently not related to each other. The severity of the cases, and the proportion of those with laryngeal implication was, however, considerable. Our laryngeal cases of diphtheria usually come from Mortlake, and a good many cases of false croup are seen amongst the poor of that parish. The table on page 47 affords an opportunity of comparing our yearly records. It is clear that, although 1909 was not quite so good a year as 1908, our position in respect of the principal infectious diseases continues to improve. It is well known that there is an annual as well as a seasonal curve for infectious diseases, 1909 was a year in which a high wave was due. But the high waves are not so high as formerly, and the occurrence rate of scarlet fever, diphtheria and typhoid is, on the 27 average, little more than half what it was a few years ago. It is true that sixteen cases of typhoid fever were notified during 1909. All but three of these, however, were due to the conveyance of the specific virus from outside the district. The circumstances of this outbreak call for narration and comment. On February 9th, I received from Dr. G. Hovenden intimation that a child in Barnes was, in his opinion, suffering from typhoid fever. On February 10th the case was removed to a London hospital, where the diagnosis made by Dr. Hovenden was contradicted, a fact of which I did not become aware until some weeks later, when the authorities finally corroborated the perfectly accurate diagnosis originally made. Within the next two or three days, two cases of children suffering from intestinal disturbance occurred in my own practice, and, as enquiry established a possible common factor for the three, I was enabled to make a diagnosis of typhoid fever with some confidence. On February 14th, I saw a fourth case, a child of eighteen months, and in this instance the common factor was also present. Enquiries and activity had, however, already been set on foot, and a purveyor of milk, whose premises were outside this district, agreed to sterilize all milk sold by him. Dr. Caldwell Smith, the Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth, was communicated with, and he satisfied himself that there was no fault to be found with either the condition of the purveyor's premises or the health of his employees. In the meantime a circular had been sent to the practitioners in this district, with the result that in the course of a few days seven cases more were discovered in Barnes. Dr. Smith also became aware of four cases in Wandsworth. Enquiries as to the 28 source of the milk revealed the fact that it was derived from 36 farms in Wiltshire, and, by February 19th, it had been found that at a certain farm one child had been ill for weeks with typhoid fever. The father of the child, though under contract to inform the London purveyor of any case of illness at his farm, had omitted in this case to do so, and had allayed suspicion by using an ordinary billhead instead of the proper contract note, as if he had been temporarily without the usual forms. The supply of milk from this farm was at once stopped, and a little later the place was visited by Dr. Caldwell Smith and myself, in company with Dr. Streeten, the Medical Officer of Health for Swindon and other districts. By this time the mother of the child just alluded to was also recognised to be suffering from typhoid, and we learned that some months previously another child belonging to the same family had suffered from an illness thought at the time to be tuberculous meningitis. We found, moreover, that one of the farm hands was said to be ill with pneumonia, and suggested further investigation. The case turned out to be typhoid. Assuming that the cases in Barnes and Wandsworth were indeed connected with the state of affairs at this farm in Wiltshire, it may be asked what was the exact nature of the relation. From a comparison of dates it appeared probable that the infection might have been due to a misuse of certain utensils during the first and second weeks in January, when the second child was sickening. But what was the source of the original infection ? The most careful enquiry failed to reveal the most remote contingency that we could think of for the infection of the first child, who, at the time, was thought to have tuberculous meningitis. Only the water supply of the farm from a neighbouring hill could be implicated by those who are not ashamed to believe in the 29 "de novo" origin of typhoid fever at times. This water supply might have become fouled by simple pollution, but the probability of specific infection was negatived. Of the 11 primary cases which occurred in Barnes, all recovered. Two secondary cases occurred and also recovered. I believe that the cases in Wandsworth also did well. Clinically the outbreak was interesting on account of the number of quite young children infected. I had one case, as already narrated, aged but 18 months. Quite a number of the cases began with symptoms, and some with physical signs of acute lobar pneumonia, and most had a heavy crop of spots. There are several other points of interest, notably the enormous importance of the correct diagnosis made, under difficult circumstances, by Dr. Hovenden. This diagnosis was arrived at on clinical grounds, though disputed for weeks by the pathologists of a first-rate London Hospital. Although of course most of the cases were notified after the probable medium of infection was recognised definitely on February 14th, all of them were infected before the sterilization of the milk commenced on February 15th, and as nearly 20,000 persons were being supplied daily by the one purveyor, the possibilities for mischief were very great. Dr. Caldwell Smith was most kind and helpful in his co-operation with me, and we both received all possible assistance from the purveyor, who did everything to help us in elucidating the facts. One or two practical recommendations may perhaps be made. Valuable as it is for Medical Officers of Health in towns to be supplied, by purveyors of milk, with lists of their sources of supply, it would be infinitely better were dairy farmers compelled to furnish 30 local Medical Officers of Health with the names of the purveyors to whom they send supplies. If this had been done in the case I am discussing it would have been useless for the farmer to juggle with his contract note, as, immediately that the presence of typhoid at the farm had been known, the local Medical Officer of Health would have communicated with Dr. Caldwell Smith and myself. Another point is that it is doubtful if statutory powers exist to prevent cheese being made from infected milk. Immediately that the supply of milk to London from his farm was rejected, the farmer began to make cheese from it. What happened to the cheese I know not: but Medical Officers of Health should certainly have the power at once, on discovery, to suspend the sale of such stuff. Three cases of typhoid that occurred during 1909 had no relation to this outbreak. In one instance the history pointed to ice cream, purchased at Hammersmith, as the vehicle: in another the lad had drunk water from Beverley Brook, and in the third there was a history of personal contact with a convalescent patient outside the district. Three fatal cases of Puerperal Fever occurred during 1909. All three were delivered by medical men. In one case peritonitis followed difficult instrumental delivery : in both the other cases the patients were, at the time of parturition, suffering from phthisis, and it was difficult to decide how far the deaths were due to septicaemia, and how far to miliary tuberculosis. As stated in my previous reports, since the coming into force of the Midwives' Act the actual inspection of the work of registered 31 midwives in Surrey has been carried out, under arrangement with the Surrey County Council, by the local Medical Officers of Health. Somewhat abruptly, towards the end of 1909, this arrangement was determined by the Surrey County Council, as it was felt that a task which had been shared by the numerous Medical Officers of Health throughout the county, would be better carried out by a lady who would devote half her time to it, and half to the work of the Surrey County Nursing Association. The fact that local Medical Officers of Health, especially when engaged in practice, have abundant opportunity in the course of their daily work of gaining knowledge of the capacity and character of the midwives, has been thought to be outweighed by the advantage of visits two or three times a year by an Inspector, who would be responsible for the whole county. I understand, also, that the suggestion was made that Medical Officers of Health engaged in practice might be induced to take a favourable view of a midwife's work if she were in the habit of calling him in in emergencies, although most, if not all such Medical Officers have been, in the past, glad that their quasi-judicial position has given them an excuse to ask midwives not to send for them on these unprofitable occasions. It is, of course, obvious that under the new regime, the same prompt official action cannot be possible as hitherto in certain cases, and it is not clear as yet how the central supervising authority proposes to obtain information of irregularities, and the practice of unregistered persons. There are at present three trained and registered midwives in Barnes and Mortlake, all of whom are competent and do their work well. Two registered but untrained midwives are also enrolled, though one of them does not practise. 32 About one half the confinements occurring during 1909 were treated by the midvvives registered under the Act, and the results were certainly extremely good. There is no doubt but that the fact that women attended by midwives cannot so easily procure the early administration of chloroform as when attended by a doctor, means fewer instrumental deliveries, fewer difficulties with the placenta, and less sepsis. On the other hand, it must be remembered that midwives do not always care to attend primiparae, unless a doctor is engaged as well. Under these circumstances the midwife acts technically as a maternity nurse, and not as a midwife. It is in respect of these cases that I apprehend difficulty under the new regime, for either the lady Inspector must attempt the control of work for which doctors are really responsible, or else an important part of midwives' practice will escape official cognizance. I hold strongly that any chief Inspector of midwives should be a qualified practitioner, either male or female, and am supported in this opinion by most, if not all, Medical Officers of Health. The estimate given in Table I. of the population of this district for the year 1909, exceeds that for 1908 by 2,000. The estimate is based on the number of inhabited houses enumerated at Midsummer, 1909, and the assumption that the average number of persons per house has slightly decreased since the Census of 1901, bearing in mind the fact that the increase in new houses was greater in the second than in the first half of the year. The number of births during 1909 was 703, and this figure gives us a birth rate of 23, slightly lower than last year. The number of births registered in Barnes proper was 278— eight less than in 1899; Morlake, however, is to be credited 33 with no less than 425, or more than twice as many as ten years ago (Table II). The number of deaths of infants under one year of age registered in the district was only 62. This is the lowest number since 1903, in which year the births were only 513. We can therefore boast an infantile mortality rate of 88. Ten years ago the rate was 126, and for the last decade the average has been 116. The total numberof deaths registered in the district was 277, and with our estimated population the uncorrected death rate is therefore only 9 per 1,000, This is the lowest rate yet on record for Barnes and Mortlake, with the exception of that sanitary annus mirabilis, 1908. The deaths of residents registered in public institutions beyond the district were, so far as ascertained, 44. This number is greater than in any former year, because greater pains have been taken to collect the particulars. Their inclusion, however, though bringing the corrected death rate up to 10.5, still leaves us with a record better than that of any year except 1908. It must be remembered that even this rate would be lower if we were able to exclude the deaths of persons whose bodies are found in the river, etc., and who have not resided in the district. Table II. shews, in addition to facts already mentioned, that not only the infantile death rate, but the general death rate, is considerably higher in Mortlake than in Barnes. There are several reasons for this, but differences in the soil and configuration may be noted. There is more clay and loam in Mortlake; more gravelly sand in Barnes. 34 Most of the facts illustrated by Table III. have been already referred to, but in connection with what has just been said it may be pointed out that, of 19 cases of phthisis 14 occurred in Mortlake. I am old-fashioned enough to still believe in Dr. Buchanan's classical researches, and think that the connection of the disease with damp soil is undoubted. In Table IV. the causes of, and ages at death are analysed. One death from diphtheria occurred outside the hospital; the death from "croup" was returned from the Richmond Infirmary. Epidemic influenza is stated to have caused 8 deaths, and phthisis 24. Here again it is to be noted that 15 of the 24 deaths have to be credited to Mortlake, Cancer accounts for 27 deaths; this disease and phthisis making up nearly 15 per cent. of the whole. Forty-six deaths were due to bronchitis or pneumonia, and again the record from Mortlake is far the worst. Table V. affords particulars of the deaths of children under one year of age, and in this table the deaths of a few which occurred in the infirmary or elsewhere are included. The deaths from diarrhoea and enteritis account for 14 of the total number, and the vague conditions included under the headings of debility, marasmus, etc. for 5. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, has not been adopted in this district, and the continued improvement in the matter of infantile mortality shews that it is perhaps hardly necessary here. Allusion has been already made to the circulars of the Board of Education, but for fuller information on the bearing of these circulars on the work in this district, the report of 35 Dr. Jones, Assistant County Medical Officer of Health (Education), will no doubt be consulted. The administration of the Factory and Workshops' Act has gone on smoothly. The official tables are given on pp. 51 to 53, and additional information on page 54. In one or two instances the Surveyor (Mr. Tomes) has been informed of places in which the provision of means of escape from fire has seemed inadequate, and generally speaking we have had no difficulty in securing compliance with our requirements. One large factory laundry was opened during the year in East Sheen. The Coroner's Court and Mortuary have been improved during the year in various respects, and are now very well adapted and equipped. Forty-four enquiries were held by Dr. Taylor, Coroner for the Kingston division, during 1909. There has been considerable expression of opinion lately in favour of Swimming Baths being provided for the district. With this opinion I heartily concur, and have indeed for years past referred to the matter, although I sincerely hope that there will be no attempt at providing an open-air bath filled from the Thames. But, whether or no a swimming bath of any kind is furnished, there is in my opinion distinct need for public single baths. Washhouses are not required. In conclusion, I have to say that I have, as usual, made both systematic and other inspections of the district, and have received the greatest assistance from my colleagues, as well as from the whole staff of the Sanitary Department and Hospital. 36 The action of the Council in allowing the addition of a clerk to the staff of the Sanitary Department is one for which I am grateful. Not only has the routine work been facilitated in consequence, but we have been able to commence a card register of the district, giving the sanitary record of each dwelling-house, shop, factory, etc. This record will, in course of time, be very valuable, and materially assist the labours of those who may follow. 37 Statistical Tables.
