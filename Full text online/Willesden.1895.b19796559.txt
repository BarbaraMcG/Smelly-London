To the Chairman and Members of the Willesden Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report of the statistics and general sanitary condition of the District during the year 1895. The general health has maintained a fairly favourable state throughout the year, but scarlet fever and diphtheria have been prevalent. METEOROLOGY. According to my recent custom, I give a short statement of the climatic conditions of the year, as I find such a short summary forms a useful reference. The latter part of January and the month of February will be remembered on account of the extreme cold that prevailed. From the Quarterly Report of the Registrar General, it appears that north of London at Barnet, the lowest point of the thermometer registered was only one degree above zero, or 31 degrees of frost; at Croydon, on the southern side, it was rather less ; in some parts of the country ( 4 ) it was below zero. This very exceptional cold continued for about a month, from January 21st to February 19th, but it also continued very cold till the beginning of the second week in March. The spring quarter was mild and dry. The rainfall for the six months ending June was only half the average amount. The summer quarter was also warmer than the average, the last week in September was very hot; the following month was cold, the frost at the end of the month being severe; November and December were mild. The rainfall for the nine months ending September was more than 6 in. below the average, and the level of the ground water would consequently be very low. The total rainfall for the last quarter was 8*09 in., being 0'97 in., or practically 1 in. above the average. Although the rainfall for the whole year was 5 in. below the average, the fall that took place in the last quarter would materially affect the level of the ground water, and it is interesting to note the alteration in the public health. From the information I have been able to obtain, it appears that diphtheria increased considerably by the end of October, the number of towns affected having increased by 20 per cent. By the beginning of November there was also a considerable increase in the number of cases of typhoid fever throughout the country. From the very severe cold of the first quarter, it would be likely that diseases of the respiratory system would be the most prevalent; there were 126 deaths from chest affections, ( 5 ) ing consumption, in that quarter; 57 in the second; 39 in the third ; and 74 in the fourth. THE DISTRICT AND WARDS. The District is situate on the north-western border of the Metropolis, and is somewhat triangular in outline. The southern boundary extends from Maida Vale, Edgware Road on the east to parish of Twyford on the west, a linear distance of about 4 miles. It abuts in its course the parishes of Paddington, Chelsea (detached), Kensington, Hammersmith and Acton. The north-western boundary is the River Brent and Twyford parish, a linear distance of about 3| miles. The north-eastern boundary is the main road from London to Edgware from a point nearly 300 yds. below the London and North-Western Railway, known as Kilburn Gate, to the Welsh Harp Reservoir at Hendon, a distance of over 3 miles. At the beginning of the year 1895, the Willesden Local Board of the previous twenty years had ceased to exist, and the Willesden Urban District Council commenced. With the change on January 1st, there was also a change in the number and area of the Wards, the ( 6 ) Local Board, consisting of fifteen members and four Wards, being replaced by the District Council with twenty-one members and seven Wards. As the census of 1891 dealt with the population in the four Wards, it has not been found possible to give the population of the new areas, as they were at that time, and therefore no reference can be made indicating the increase of each, but the progress of the District generally has apparently made a greater stride than hitherto, the estimated increase of population being 5,620, nearly 900 more than the increase of the previous year. From 1881 to 1891, the average yearly increase was 3,365. DESCRIPTION OF THE AREAS AND BOUNDARIES OF THE NEW WARDS. No. 1, North-West Ward.—This is bounded on the west by the River Brent, on the south by Harrow Road, Old Harrow Road, St. Mary's Road and Roundwood Ditch and Road, and by Kingsbury Road, Dudden Hill Lane, Pound Lane and Harlesden Lane on the east. This embraces Stonebridge, north of Harrow Road, Church End, and the portion of Neasden, south-west of Kingsbury Road. No. 2, South-West Ward.—This boundary on the north is conterminous with No. 1 Ward by Harrow Road, Old Harrow Road, St. Mary's Road and Roundwood Ditch and Road. It then passes through the Green Lane to the Victor Road Railway ( 7 ) Bridge, Kensal, and is bounded on the south by Hammersmith and Acton. This includes Harlesden Green and Lower Place. No. 3, South Central Ward.—This adjoins the No. 2 boundary at the Green Lane to Victor Road Railway Bridge, Kensal, and thence passes eastward along the Harrow Road to Kilburn Lane, and following the Chelsea and Paddington boundary to Salusbury Road, West Kilburn, turning northward through the latter to the North-London Railway line, which forms the northern boundary as far as Kensal Rise Station. At this point it turns northward along the Chambers Lane Footpath, to a point from which it turns westward through fields and intersects Harlesden Road at Newbery Road, nearly opposite the new Recreation Ground. This Ward includes Kensal Rise and the portion of Kilburn west of Salusbury Road. No. 4, South Kilburn Ward.—This is a somewhat triangular area south of the London and Northwestern Railway, two of the sides abut upon the Paddington district, and the north is divided from No. 5 Ward by Cambridge Avenue, Chichester Road and the western portion of Canterbury Road. No. 5, Mid Kilburn Ward.—This is located north of the last Ward, No. 4, through Cambridge Avenue, Chichester Road and the western portion of Canterbury Road. It is bounded on the west by ( 8 ) Salusbury Road, and Kilburn High Road on the east, and on the north by No. 6 or North Kilburn Ward, through Glengall Road and rear of Paddington Cemetery. No. 6, North Kilburn Ward.— This is north of the No. 5 or Mid Kilburn Ward and conterminous at Glengall Road. It extends east and west from the Kilburn High Road to Salusbury Road, and on the north-west is bounded by Coverdale Road and Mapesbury Road to the Mill at Shoot-up Hill. No. 7, North-East Ward.— This includes Willesden Green and Cricklewood. It is bounded by the Welsh Harp Reservoir and the Brent River on the north, by Edgware Main Road as far as the Mill at Shoot-up Hill and Brondesbury Park on the east, by Kingsbury Road, Dudden Hill Lane, Pound Lane and Harlesden Road on the west, and on the south by No.„ 3 Ward—by a course through fields from Harlesdeft Road, opposite the Recreation Ground, to Chambers Lane Footpath, and the NorthLondon Railway from Kensal Station to Salusbury Road. THE BRENT RIVER. The condition of this river has been in no way ameliorated by the Canal Company who take the water from the stream. SEWERAGE. This is in two distinct parts, the sewers of the southern portion being connected with the ( 9 ) litan ; the other, the Brent system, is, I believe, to be the subject of a special report by the Surveyor. WATER SUPPLY. This is by the West Middlesex Water Company, and I must again express my regret that the Company have not seen their way to giving a constant supply. It is to be hoped that in any future legislation on the water supply that this will be amended, and also the power of the Water Company to restrict the supply to water closets to two gallons. The latter is an insufficient quantity to effectually cleanse the closet, and leads to dirty pans, foul traps, and choked drains, with consequent illness and deaths from preventible diseases. I have in my former Reports alluded to the insufficient amount supplied to houses, the smallness of the cisterns and the absolute, not scarcity, but absence of water for general purposes on the days when water is used for the laundry needs of the house. It is to be hoped that legislation will soon remedy the defects of the present insanitary condition. In my Report for last year I mentioned instances of the manholes to house drains being blocked, which would be much less likely to occur if a sufficient supply of water were always available. ( 10 ) I consider it would be a great advantage if such fittings as would satisfy the requirements of the Water Company should always be placed in new houses, and that a constant supply should be provided in every new road. Such fittings would probably entail an inappreciable difference in the cost to the builder. POPULATION. The estimated population at Midsummer is 79,260. This is a natural increase by births over deaths of 1,385. The actual estimated increase for the year is 5,620, at which rate, if maintained, the population before the end of the century would be considerably over 100,000. The mode of estimating the population is by taking the number of houses on the rate books, deducting 5.9 per cent, for empty houses, which was the per centage of empties at the time of the census, and multiplying the number of houses by the average number of persons in each house, also shewn by the census; this latter varies in the different Wards, and consequently the change from four to seven Wards causes some difficulty in adjusting the average number of persons in each house, but I think the difficulty has been met and that a fair estimate has been obtained. The total number of houses in the District multiplied by an average number in each house would give a near approach to (11) ness. The birth rate is another means of testing the growth of the population; this year it is 31.14 per 1,000, which is about the annual rate for the last few years, and is about 0.2 per cent, lower than at the time of the census. There is another way in which the population may be estimated and which is adopted and recommended by some statisticians, and that is by taking the growth that is already known and calculating the rate of increase by logarithms. In my Report for 1892 I showed that I considered such an estimate would be very misleading, as it would indicate that at the census of 1901 the population would be 130,000. From a return received from the Clerk to the Board of Guardians, it appears that there are 160 inmates of the house belonging to Willesden: males, 53; females, 92 ; children, 15; there were also 94 persons in lunatic asylums : males, 38; females, 56. These numbers added to the population give a total of 79,514. ( 12 ) TABLE No. 1. Population at Census, 1891. Houses placed on Kate - book since Census, less 5 9 per cent, for empties.

To this must be added 12 births : six ( 15 ) boys and six girls, which took place in the workhouse, which addition, however, does not alter the rate. This is a little higher than the rate last year, which was 30.7, but is scarcely up to the average of previous years. The birth rate for the country generally for the year was 29.5. The births registered in each of the last six years were as follows, viz.:— bate fob the yeah. 1890 1,811 . 29.48 1891 2,059 33.1 1892 2,085 31.7 1893 2,252 32.5 1894 2,264 30.7 1895 2,469 31.1 It will thus be seen that the rate for this year is very near the average of those six years. Illegitimate Births.—Boys, 28; girls, 26; total, 54, being 2*1 per cent, of total births. DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered in the District during the year was 1,084: males, 500; females, 584, equal to a rate of 13.6 per 1,000. To this number must be added the number of deaths in public institutions outside the District of persons belonging to it. There were 46 deaths in the workhouse, six of children under five years of age and 40 of people over five years of age: males, 22 ; females, 24. The deaths in lunatic asylums were ( 16 ) seven : two males and five females, and six fatal cases of infectious diseases occurred in the various Metropolitan hospitals. These all make a total of 1,143 deaths of persons belonging to the District and an average rate of 14.5 per 1,000. The deaths in other institutions and places outside the District I have no knowledge of so am obliged to consider them counterbalanced by the deaths in the District of persons not belonging to it. The rate for England and Wales for the year has been 18.8. In 33 great towns, 20.6 ; in 67 other large town districts, of which Willesden is one, 18.8. In Willesden the average rates for three series of five years each from 1881 were 16.6: 14.4 and 14.3, but the last contains the deaths that have occurred during three years in the workhouse, which the other series do not, so that the rate is a little more favourable in the last series than actually appears. We find therefore, what I think may be regarded as an interesting fact, that although the population has increased from 27,362 in 1881 to 79,000 in 1895, the general health of the District has not only been maintained but rather improved with its growth. Infant Deaths.—The deaths of infants under one year of age have been 373, being 34.4 per cent, of total deaths registered in Willesden, and 15 per cent, of total births. Of children under five years ( 17 ) of age there were 505, being 46.6 per cent, of deaths. As a gauge of the sanitary condition of a district, the death rates of children under one and under five years of age are regarded as important, and also the death rate of typhoid fever. These are the three most .mportant data. As regards children under one year, the calculation is made with respect to the number of births. Taking an average of ten years throughout England and Wales this has been found to be practically 150 per 1,000, which may be taken therefore as a permissible standard, anything above that being considered indicative of some insanitary condition. With regard to children under five years of age, the calculation is made in connection with each 1,000 living under that age. The number of children under five, including those under one year of age, in our population would be 10,778, and the permissible death rate on the same average of ten years would be 63 per 1,000. Dividing the number of deaths of children under one year, 373, by the births, 2,469, we find the rate per 1,000 to be 151, or only just over the permissible standard; again, by dividing the deaths, 505, of children under five years of age, by the number, 10,778, living under that age, we get an average of 46.85, which is considerably under the permissible standard. The conditions with regard to typhoid fever are also favourable, the death rate being 0.15 per 1,000 of the population, the average rate of ten years throughout the country being 0.32. ( 18 ) The following list compares the death rates of certain diseases in Willesden and the country generally, viz.:— Willesden. England & Wales. (Average of 10 years.) Small Pox o.oo 0.08 Measles 0.06 0.38 Scarlet Fever 0.21 0.72 Diphtheria ... 0.42 0.12 Whooping Cough 0.10 0.51 Typhoid Fever 0.l0 0.32 Diarrhoea 0.73 0.91 Phthisis 1.21 2.12 Diseases of Respiratory System ... 2.30 3.76 Referring to the above list it will be seen that diphtheria is the only one that is above the average. Deaths of Illegitimate Children.— There were 32 deaths, inquests being held in two cases. The certified causes of death were bronchitis, 3 ; convulsions, 1; consumption of bowels, 1; debility, 15; diarrhoea, 4; inflammation of bowels, 1 ; jaundice, 1 ; premature birth, 1; skin disease, 1 ; syphilis, 1; throat disease, 1.

It will be seen that the two lines bear a great relation to each other. ( 23 ) NOTIFICATIONS. These are required under a Local Act of 1887, which came into operation in October of that year. Owing to the presence of scarlet fever and diphtheria in considerable epidemic form the number of notifications have been more this year than last, though not so many as in 1893. There have been altogether 741 received, giving an average of 9.3 per 1,000 of the population. Last year the average was 7.5. The amount paid during the year to Medical Men for Notification Certificates was £84 15s. 0d., and the cost of disinfecting rooms after infectious diseases was £130 16s. 6d. During the last three years the following cases have been notified, viz:— 1893. 1894. 1895.

There is, I fear, some misapprehension as to patients being removed to Isolation Hospitals. Under the Public Health Act of 1875, section 124, it states "Where any suitable hospital or place for the reception of the sick is provided within the district of a Local Authority, any person who is suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, and is without proper lodging and accommodation, may, on a certificate signed by a legally qualified medical practitioner, and with the consent of the superintending body of such hospital or place, be removed, by order of any Justice, to such hospital or place, at the cost of the Local Authority; and any person so suffering who is lodged in any common lodging. house, may, with the like consent on a like certificate, be so removed by order of the Local Authority." ( 25 ) It is plain therefore that a Medical Officer of Health has no power to order the removal of a patient to an Isolation Hospital, but he may, under that section, if he thinks it necessary, apply to a Justice for an order. The necessity of making such an application has not arisen, and consequently no patient has been compelled to enter the hospital. Small Pox.—The first case occurred in February. The patient was a lad whose parents were extremely anxious with regard to him, and asked permission for his grandmother to accompany him, offering to pay 10s. a week for the permission. The grandmother herself was taken in a few days with the disease, and two of the subordinate staff, although vaccinated. One of the staff was first taken ill with scarlet fever and admitted into the scarlet fever ward, within two days she shewed symptoms of small pox and had to be removed to a small pox ward; the scarlet fever was then masked by the other disease, till in due time she peeled in true scarlet fever fashion, and ultimately made a good recovery. I vaccinated all the children in the ward, except the very young ones who had good marks of vaccination, and none of the patients contracted the disease. By removing the first patient to the hospital the disease did not spread in that neighbourhood, but another case was reported from a different part of the Parish at the end of March, he also was removed to hospital, and there were no more cases till December. A man was notified on a Sunday morning as suffering from ( 26 ) small pox and was at once removed; he was employed during the week at the East End and only came to Kilburn on Saturday afternoon to stay for the following day with his sister. She also took the disease in a very modified form, having only two pustules on the face and a very few on the body, was admitted to the hospital at the end of the year. Owing to the presence of the disease in the Metropolis, I thought it right to have a tent in readiness in case of an outbreak during the summer, but fortunately no necessity arose for its use. One case was notified from the South.West Ward, the man was engaged in carrying round milk, he could give no reliable information as to where he had caught the infection. The isolation of the case stopped any further development. Scarlet Fever.—This disease has prevailed extensively, especially in the last six months of the year. A sudden increase occurred in July, but. by removing many of the cases to the hospital, in three weeks it was much abated. Shortly after a second increase occurred, more especially in connection with the parts of the District bordering on the Metropolis. By referring to the Chart of the disease it will be seen how very much the rise and fall resembles the rise and fall in London; the Chart in the latter case is approximate only, though the curve is a correct one, and is introduced to shew how ( 27 ) Willesden is apparently influenced by the state of its big neighbour. It appears to me that this disease and diphtheria are very much more influenced by the Free Education Act than is perhaps usually supposed. The school attendance officers are more insistant on the children attending school and the parents are afraid of the consequences of keeping their little ones at home for what they think might be only a slight ailment and consequently send them when they are not in a fit condition to go. In several instances children have been sent when in a state of peeling from scarlet fever, the original attack having been slight and so escaped notice, or, if noticed, not recognised; the illness thus not being severe no doctor has been consulted, and it has only been when one child has had a severe attack that the other cases have been brought to notice. The schools thus become centres of propagation, the buildings, the desks, the seats, the books, all are in a condition to rekindle the disease when the children reassemble after the holidays. The most complete disinfection should be carried out during the holidays when there has been illness of an infectious nature, and even when no instance of disease has been brought to the notice of the masters it is desirable that disinfection be done. A preparation evolving chlorine would be the best to use, the action of this gas being much more efficacious than sulphurous acid. ( 28 ) A glance at the Chart will also show how the two diseases, scarlet fever and diphtheria, prevail together; it has also been very noticeable, especially towards the latter part of the year, how many children have been attacked with the two diseases at the same time. Diphtheria.—It would almost seem that the remarks applicable to scarlet fever might be used with regard to diphtheria, for although in the latter disease children do not attend school in a state of peeling, they do attend with sore throats, and the unrecognised slight cases go on till a sudden severe one draws attention to the disease. In the remarks on meteorology, I have drawn attention to what I think might have a decided influence in spreading the disease, but that is not the only one or perhaps the most important. A close atmosphere in a confined space as an ill. ventilated room is probably the most potent factor in spreading the disease and rendering it of a virulent character. In some cases the house drains have been found choked. There have been no indications of a contaminated milk supply; in many cases condensed milk has been used. Typhoid Fever.—This disease has not shewn any special outbreak, although it has been present more in the South.West Ward. ( 29 ) Measles and Whooping Cough.—These diseases have not been present to any extent, in fact there appear to have been comparatively few cases. Diarrhœa.—This prevailed for a certain time during the summer months, but the deaths were all of children under five years of age and nearly all under one. There were two cases of infantile cholera reported. This infant diarrhoea is due more to injudicious feeding than any other cause; the more rapid souring of milk in hot weather and the consequent quicker fouling of feeding bottles and pipes is not sufficiently thought of by those having charge of infants. Phthisis.—The death rate from this disease has been low, 1.2 per 1,000, the general rate being about 2.0 per 1,000. VACCINATION RETURNS. No. of Births for the year 1895. Successfully Vaccinated.

This with the ambulance arrangements and the disinfecting chamber have all been in complete operation during the twelve months and have been fully made use of. The ambulance is thoroughly ( 30 ) cleansed inside after each case is brought. A separate ambulance is kept for small pox cases. With regard to the disinfecting of bedding, which was formerly done by a Contractor, a saving has been effected. A disinfecting apparatus has been erected in Hospital Grounds. Two vans are used for fetching infected articles and returning them. The cost of the work done by the Contractor during the years 1893.4 amounted to £257 6s. 6d. and £263 respectively. The cost during the present year when the work was done by the Council's apparatus and employees, has amounted to £102 16s. Od. only. UNSOUND FOOD. Two trunks of fish were certified, condemned and destroyed as unfit for food. COWSHEDS, DAIRIES and MILKSHOPS. The cowsheds were all visited and inspected, and notices served to cleanse and whitewash in accordance with the Regulations, also to remove accumulations of manure in a few cases. The dairies and milkshops were also visited and inspected; and the water storage examined. In no instance of infectious disease did the origin sufficiently point to the milk supply to justify any procedure under the Milk Clauses of the Statute. ( 31 ) WORKSHOPS. An inspection of the workshops and laundries in the District was made. They were generally found in a fair condition, but the following amendments were called for and complied with, viz.:— In 19 to cleanse and whitewash. „ 1 „ provide additional w.c. accommodation. ,, 2 „ repair drains. 1 „ remove manure. BAKEHOUSES. The bakehouses of the District were inspected, numbering 48, and found clean and generally in good condition. In a few instances the sweepings had not recently been removed, and the proprietors' attentions were directed to the neglect, which resulted in the immediate removal of the same, and reprehension of the workmen. Notices were served for the periodical limewhiting of them, which were attended to. About one-half of the bakehouses of the District are below the street level, and these compare very unfavourably with the remainder for space, light, air and ventilation. It is very satisfactory to know that no more underground bakehouses are allowed to be constructed. SLAUGHTER.HOUSES. The slaughter.houses remain the same in number as last year, viz.: nine; three at Kilburn; five ( 32 ) at Harlesden; and one at Kensal. Of these five are licensed by the Council annually, and four are registered only, having heen in existence previous to the establishment of the Local Authority. They were periodically inspected and lime. washed, and no contraventions of the Regulations were discovered. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. No new premises were registered under the Common Lodging Clauses of the Public Health Act. The existing places, which are not of the type usually understood by the term, were visited and inspected, and the Regulations to limewash periodically duly carried out. No case of infectious disease was notified. INSPECTION OF CANAL BOATS. There were 42 special visits made to the canal during the year for the purpose of inspecting the boats used as dwellings, under the provision of the Canal Boats Act. This number is less than usual, owing to the canal being frozen for a long period in the early part of the year, and the consequent absence of boats. Eighty.nine boats were inspected, which were occupied by 91 men, 66 women and 85 children. The following infringements of the Regulations were observed, viz.:— ( 33 ) 5 Boats required re.marking and painting. 7 Certificates were missing. 1 „ did not identify owner and boat. 1 Boat required thorough repair. Notices were given in these cases to carry out the requirements of the Statute, which were duly complied with. The boats generally were in good and clean condition, and the occupants courteous in giving necessary information. INFANT LIFE PROTECTION ACT. No new premises were registered under this Act during the year, nor are there any existing premises or persons registered. Inquiries were made in all cases of deaths registered of illegetimate children, with the view of obtaining information that might lead to the discovery of any infringements of this Statute. Proceedings had to be taken to enforce the orders of the Council in six instances as follows, viz.:— No. For defective drains 1 ,, premises being in such a state as to be a nuisance 4 „ effluvia from trade business 1 Total 6 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Orders and costs were granted and a penalty in one instance, with imprisonment in default. ( 34 ) PEEL ROAD SHELTER. In the early part of the year a serious nuisance existed in Kilburn from the establishment by the Kilburn Sisterhood of a Shelter and Rest for destitute men at the premises in Peel Road, Kilburn, formerly the Catholic Schools. All sorts of wretched, destitute, and homeless men were attracted here, by being able to obtain gratuitous refreshment, warmth, shelter and rest for the night and part of the day, to the great alarm and disgust of the residents of the immediate neighbourhood. Several inspections were made by myself and the Chief Inspector, in order to realise the exact conditions. Many of the men would be about the locality during the day, when some refreshment could be had at certain times, but the great muster would commence at about 8 o'clock in the evening when some of them would take up the nearest positions to the premises, and continue to pack themselves in files on the pathway until about 11.30 when the doors opened. They would extend at this time to the corner of Peel Road and reach for some considerable distance around the adjoining street. They were admitted into the building at this time regulated by a Constable, and a Sister would ( 35 ) supply each with refreshment as they entered, and they would then proceed to the tables and eat. Afterwards they would lay their heads and arms upon the tables and sleep. Some would be on the floor with their boots and jackets for pillows. There were on one occasion 350 men there, and on cubing up the space the area was not more than sufficient for one.fifth of that number. I considered this a great menace to the health of the neighbourhood, not only on account of the overcrowding, but also, from the men coming from various localities, they were probably in touch with infectious disease and might propagate it in this District. A notice was served upon the Authorities to abate the nuisance from overcrowding, and on a second visit I found the numbers considerably reduced, but overcrowding still existed. After some further protest the premises were voluntarily closed without recourse to legal proceedings. ( 36 ) SPECIAL COMPLAINTS, 1895.
