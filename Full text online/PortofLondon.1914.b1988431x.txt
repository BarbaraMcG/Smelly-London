LONDON: Printed by Charles Skipper & East, 49, Great Tower Street, K.O. 1915. JOHNSTON, Mayor. A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the City of London, on Thursday, the 22nd day of April, 1015. THE Port of London Sanitary Committee did this day deliver into this Court a Report in writing under their hands, of their proceedings, and submitting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Port to the 31st December, 1914; which was read. And a Motion being made and Question put, That this Court doth agree with the Committee in their said Report, the same was resolved in the Affirmative. Ordered, That the Report be printed, and a copy sent to every Member of this Court. BELL. To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled. WE, whose names are hereunto subscribed, of your Port of London Sanitary Committee, to whom it has been referred to carry into execution the powers assigned to the Corporation, as the Port of London Sanitary Authority by the Local Government Board, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, beg to submit for the information of your Honourable Court the Annual Report of Dr. Herbert Williams, the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London, for the year ended the 31st December, 1914, which Report contains a full and detailed account of the work done in the Port during that period by the Medical Officers and Inspectors. The attention of your Committee has been drawn to the diminution in the number of ships arriving from Foreign Ports. This, as pointed out, is due to the closing of the Baltic and the Dardanelles, and the action of the British Fleet in preventing the arrival of vessels from Germany and Austria. The Medical Officer draws attention to the fact that Austrian troops have been engaged in the Western area of the War, and as cases of cholera have occurred amongst the Austrian troops in Galicia, he thinks it possible that the infective organism of cholera may have been introduced into Belgium and the Northern places, and that with the onset of warm weather, this danger may have to be met, and guarded against. Daring the year under review, although a large number of rats were examined bacteriologically, not one was found showing any evidence of being infected with plague. This is most satisfactory, as, during the previous five years, rats infected with plague were found on several occasions. It is to be regretted that the Port of London Authority have not carried out the work necessary to make the buildings in the docks, especially those which contain foodstuffs, proof against the entrance of rats. Although no rats were found infected with plague, your Committee propose to continue the bacteriological examination of rats, as it is of vital importance that any such occurrence should be detected at once, and the necessary precautions taken, not only in the interests of public health, but with a view to protecting the interests of the maritime trade of the Port of London. The Aliens Act which has been in force for the past eight years, and in respect of which your Medical Officer was appointed Medical Inspector for the Port of London, ceased to be in force with the onset of War, and the arrangements made by the Home Office with your Medical Officer, were terminated by notice on the 31st December, 1914. The Home Office expressed the hope that, should it be found necessary to resume the inspection under the Aliens Act, the services of your Medical Officer of Health might be again available. Some thirty cases of Enteric Fever were treated at Denton Hospital, of which two died, and the remainder recovered. Seven cases were taken off one ship. It is very rarely that any information can be obtained as to the arrival of cases of infectious disease, until the vessel comes to Gravesend, so that beds and staff have always to be kept available for any emergency that may arise. Since pulmonary tuberculosis became a notifiable disease, special attention has been paid to this complaint, with the result that, during the year, no less than 168 cases, including those known as miners' phthisis, were found on vessels. The destinations of these cases were ascertained as far as possible, and the information notified to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts concerned, so that they may be kept under conditions suitable not only for their recovery, but for preventing the spread of this disease, and the cabins occupied by the patients have been efficiently disinfected. The Medical Officer reports certain cases where men have been engaged on three vessels, in the preparation of food, whilst suffering from obvious signs of pulmonary tuberculosis, and he expresses the opinion that it is desirable that a medical examination should be made before engaging any men employed on board ship in the preparation of food, so as to prevent those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis from being engaged in such work. Two cases of cerebro-spinal meningitis were notified, and this disease, with chicken-pox, has been notifiable during the year. An account is given at length of the work involved in the examination of food, which forms a very important and very large proportion of the work done by officers of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. It is satisfactory to find that meat generally has arrived in good condition, and with regard to meat from Australia, very few quarters have been found affected with onchocerciasis, whilst tongues arriving from South America also show marked improvement as regards the presence of actinomycosis, due largely to the thoroughness of examination in the countries of exportation. Six members of the Staff are serving with his Majesty's Forces. In each case they have been paid the proportion of salary or wages which your Honourable Court decided to pay them, and their places will be kept open for them until their return, temporary help having been engaged in such instances as were necessary to perform their duties. Your Committee have appointed Dr. W. M. Willoughby as Deputy Medical Officer of Health. This has been found to conduce to the efficiency of the service, especially in the lower part of the district, at G-ravesend. The launch " Clotho," after being in use for over thirty years was disposed of, and considering her condition, a fair price was obtained. The Medical Officer suggests that she should be replaced by a motor launch which would also be of use for landing cases of illness at Denton Hospital. The arrangements for landing cases have not met with the entire approbation of your Committee. This question will be considered in connection with the provision of a new launch, and a report on the subject will be presented to your Honourable Court in due course. A special report of the working of the Canal Boats Act Regulations is included in the Report, and an account of receipts and expenditure in connection with the Port of London Sanitary Authority, for the year ended December 31st, 1914, is also appended, in accordance with the Order of your Honourable Court, for the information of the Court. All which we submit to the judgment of your Honourable Court. Dated this thirteenth day of April, 1915. H. Percy Monckton. Walter H. Key. James Wann. Edward Hughes. Albion T. Snell. T. Robinson. J.

TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith my Annual Report for the year 1914, being the thirteenth of the series. The total number of vessels arriving in the Port of London, from "foreign" during the year, was 7,985 at Gravesend, and 265 at Sheerness, the average for the past ten years being 9,474.7 at Gravesend, and 324 at Sheerness. Of the total arrivals, 1,976 were medically inspected at Gravesend, and 186 at Sheerness. The details of these figures are given in Tables I and II. Infectious Disease is dealt with in Tables V. to XXYL, with details of cases exhibiting points of public interest. Food Inspection is specially dealt with; full particulars will be found in Tables XXVII. to XXXII. Sanitary Inspection is summarised in Tables XXXIII. to XXXVII., and this section of the work has been well and efficiently maintained. The working of the Canal Boats Acts is dealt with in the usual Special Annual Report on this subject, which is appended to this Report. There was a falling off in the number of vessels arriving from "foreign" at Gravesend after the 3rd August. This is partly explained by the fact that no ships arrived from German, Austrian or Baltic ports, and the subsequent closing of the Dardanelles prevented arrivals from the Black Sea. Many of the vessels arriving from these ports are of the smaller size, but it will probably be found when the figures are obtainable that there has been a serious diminution in the amount of tonnage arriving, as owing to the congestion at the docks many of these larger regular traders have had to remain in the Port for days awaiting discharge, and so have made fewer voyages. 8 TABLE I.

This Act having been superseded by legislation better adapted to the special circumstances arising from a state of War, it may be of interest to review shortly the routine and some of the points brought out by the Medical Examination of aliens under the Act during the eight years now completed. The Medical Inspection of aliens arriving in the Port of London was placed in the hands of your Medical Officer of Health, by the Secretary of State, in conformity with the powers of arrangement conferred by Section 6 of the Act. An " immigrant ship " was defined by the Act to be " a ship which brings to the United Kingdom more than twenty alien steerage passengers who are to be landed in the United Kingdom, whether at the same or different ports, or such number of those passengers as may be for the time being fixed by order of the Secretary of State, either generally or as regards any special ships or ports." It was arranged that the examination should be carried out between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. on each day, and a Medical Officer had to be available within these hours, and if more than one immigrant ship was expected, the services of an additional Medical Officer had to be arranged for. 10 The object of the Medical Inspection was to ascertain if an alien was undesirable on account of:â€” (a) The absence of the means of decently supporting himself and his dependents (if any), or (b) Being a lunatic or an idiot, or owing to any disease or infirmity likely to become a charge upon the rates, or otherwise a detriment to the public. Daring the period, 77,295 aliens were medically examined, and 1,368 were refused leave to land. At first the rejections were numerous, but when the shipping companies who brought undesirable passengers found that they had to return them whence they came, they found it to their interest to have them all medically examined before embarkation, and as the standard of fitness at the port of departure was based upon the standard of examination in London, the number of rejections on immigrant vessels became ultimately very few. It is, however, known that many aliens undesirable on medical grounds found their way into this country on vessels not carrying the requisite number of alien steerage passengers to constitute them as " immigrant vessels " within the meaning of the Act, thus they escaped any medical inspection. On one occasion a vessel arrived and declared 20 alien steerage passengers, and so was not an "immigrant vessel." The discovery of an American passenger on board who had been considered as English raised the number to 21, and the passengers were then carefully examined, with a result that six cases of trachoma were discovered who were rejected and sent back after appealing to the Immigration Board, The arrangement under which I have been acting as Medical Inspector of Aliens in the Port of London terminated after notice from the Home Office on December 31st, 1914. In connection with these duties, since the Act came into force, a certain amount of clerical work has had to be done, and this has been willingly performed by the clerical staff, in addition to the ordinary clerical work of the Port Sanitary Authority. REFUGEES. On Thursday evening, 3rd September, 1914, Dr. Buchanan, the Acting Principal Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, telephoned that a large number of Belgian refugees, 50,000â€”100,000, were expected to arrive at Tilbury from Antwerp. It was reported in the press that these refugees would have to leave Antwerp before midnight on the 4th September, and the probability, therefore, was that they would be packed on such vessels as were lying in that port, possibly cargo boats without proper accommodation for a number of passengers, or even sufficient food on board for the voyage, and therefore they might arrive at any time. The matter was very urgent, so I visited Gravesend forthwith, and all the necessary arrangements for dealing with the arrival of a large number of such people, were ready by 5 p.m. of the 4th September; these were as follows:â€” (1) A medical inspection of all persons on board to ascertain whether anyone was suffering with a dangerous infectious disorder. Your Medical Officer of Health, with three assistant Medical Officers, were available for this work, whilst Dr. Buchanan had kindly offered the services of three of the Local Government Board Medical Inspectors to assist in the work of inspection. 11 All persons suffering from dangerous infectious disorders would have been removed to hospitalâ€”the Local Government Board were especially apprehensive oÂ£ the presence of small-pox and enteric fever amongst the refugees. (2) If any of the passengers had been obviously filthy and unwholesome, they would have been landed at Denton Hospital, cleansed, their clothes disinfected, and arrangements were made at the Hospital for doing this. (3) If any of the refugees had been in a state of collapse, or suffering from some illness other than an infectious disorder, which would have rendered them unfit to travel without danger to life, I intended to have landed them at Denton Hospital as a matter of common humanity, so far as accommodation was available. (4) A supply of bread, milk, bovril, tea and hot water could have been available at short notice in the event of any of the refugees suffering from want of nourishment. The Local Government Board arranged to telephone to me and send a telegram to the Hulk at Gravesend directly they received any information of the departure of vessels conveying refugees from Antwerp. These arrangements were kept available throughout Saturday and Sunday, the 5th and 6th September respectively, but on Monday, 7th September, I received a letter from Dr. Buchanan, of the Local Government Board, saying that there had been a hitch about transport and certain international matters, and that it was uncertain if the scheme would take effect. The British Government had consented to receive these refugees, had taken over all the arrangements for transport to this country and their reception after arrival, and in accordance with the instructions of the Court of Common Council, I rendered all possible assistance and co-operated with the Government Officials in every possible way, at the same time carrying out all the duties of Medical Inspection, &c., as the Port of London Sanitary Authority are required by statute to do. The refugees began arriving on Friday, 11th September, by the ordinary passenger boats of the Great Eastern Railway Company, which usually ply between Antwerp and Harwich, so that they arrived under satisfactory conditions as regards personal cleanliness, food, &c. The boats usually arrived in the evening, the largest number on any one boat being 928, and 13,389 refugees have arrived in this Port up to 31st December. They were all medically examined before leaving the boat, or before embarkation, for infectious diseases, and then were landed by a tender at Tilbury station, where special trains were in waiting to convey them to their destination. A supply of bovril, milk, &c., was available on the station platform, handed round by kind voluntary helpers, whilst a doctor and nurse were in attendance, who travelled with the train, so that the refugees were well looked after, and seemed much to appreciate the kindness shown them on their arrival in this country. I desire to express my appreciation of the assistance given me by Dr. Willoughby and the other Medical Officers of this Authority, cheerfully and willingly rendered at times when they were not officially on duty. It was not found necessary to admit any of the refugees to Denton Hospital, either for infectious disease or for other causes. Three children were found suffering with measles, but they were allowed to go to the hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in charge of a doctor and nurse of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 12 TABLE V.â€” INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

This disease was prevalent in several towns in Galicia, and also occurred in Vienna amongst the troops who had returned there after fighting in that locality. Cases were even reported to have occurred in Belgium, but there is no definite confirmation of this. It is, however, known that Austrian troops have been fighting in the Western area of the War, and it is not improbable that the organisms of this disease may have been thus introduced into that region. If this be so, cases of Cholera may occur in the course of the Summer of 1915, and a careful watch must be kept so as to isolate the first suspected cases and so minimise the risk of this disease spreading, and the possibility of cases occurring amongst the troops and other persons returning to this country, who will have to be carefully watched, and it may mean the bacteriological examination of the excreta of a number of persons. This question has been considered, and in case of necessity arrangements for doing the work can be put in force, so as to minimize the detention and inconvenience to persons arriving on vessels in the Port of London.

This disease continues to be endemic in many countries of the world, and the precautions required by the Local Government Board Order of the 9th September, 1907, have been carried out. 2,716 rats have been bacteriologically examined during the year, and I am pleased to say that no evidence of Plague has been found in any one of them. The destruction of rats in the Docks continues, but the Dock Authorities still remain indifferent to the necessity of rendering rat-proof those shore buildings in which food stuffs are stored. 16 The s.s. "Caledonia," of Greenock, 102,390, arrived at Gravesend on the 13th March from Bombay, On the 25th February one of the crew, a Goanese scullion, was taken ill, and developed a bubo in the left inguinal region. He was landed at Suez, where the diagnosis of plague was confirmed bacteriologically. Disinfection was carried out. No dead rats were found on board. On arrival at Gravesend all were found to be well, and the ship was kept under observation while in the Port. The vessel left Bombay on the 21st February, 1914, so that only four days elapsed from the departure of the vessel and onset of the illness. It was therefore probable that the man was infected in Bombay before leaving, and it was not necessary to fumigate the vessel in order to destroy the rats on board. The Local Government Board was duly notified of this case. The s.s. "Persia," of Greenock, 109,258, arrived in Tilbury Dock on the 5th June from Bombay, There had been no suspicious cases of illness during the voyage, but on discharging the cargo from No. 4 hold, on the 6 th, nine dead rats were found. A post-mortem and microscopical examination was made by Dr. Willoughby, and in his opinion the appearances were suspicious of plague. The hold was therefore shut down, and fumigated before the cargo was discharged. I allowed the cargo to be discharged from the other holds, and had a careful watch kept for any dead rats in these holds. As soon as the rest of the cargo was discharged, the ship was fumigated by sulphur di-oxide gas. Bacteriological examination of rats found subsequently was carried out, but the results were "negative" as regards plague. The crew were kept under daily observation, and on the 18th June a native was taken ill with pneumonia. He was removed to Denton Hospital on the 19th for observation, but no suspicious symptoms presented themselves. The patient was discharged from hospital on the 23rd June. On the 14th November I received information from the Medical Officer of Health for Bristol that a case suspicious of plague had been landed there from the s.s. "Kilchattan" on the 12th November, and that the vessel would proceed to London. All necessary disinfection was carried out, and rat precautions complied with. A specimen of material from bubo was sent to the Local Government Board, and I received a report stating that the result was " negative " as regards plague. The s.s. "Malakand," of Liverpool, 120,907, arrived at Gravesend on the 3rd December from Calcutta, having landed a case suspicious of plague at Suez on the 17th November. The ship is stated to have been disinfected at Suez, and no other suspicious cases occurred. All were well on arrival at Gravesend. The vessel left Calcutta on the 28th October, 1914, and the man ailed on November 17th. There were no dead rats discovered during the voyage, and the man was simply attacked with fever, without any bubo. There was no evidence that the man was suffering from Plague, and the vessel was therefore not fumigated. 17 TABLE X. Return of Rats caught and destroyed during 1914.

In my last Annual Report, I gave particulars of a Conference which had been held between the Port of London Sanitary Authority and the Port of London Authority, at the Local Government Board, with a view to certain measures being taken in the docks to prevent the risk of plague arising within the Port of London. I regret to say that no serious attempt has been made to have these measures carried out. TABLE XII. (Small-pox.) Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry and Official Number. Where from. No. of Cases.

"Antigone" of London, 123,694, arrived on the 9th January from Smyrna, when a case of Small-pox was removed therefrom to Denton Hospital. 19 All necessary disinfection was carried out, and the men were taken ashore and bathed. Vaccination was performed in the case of 21 persons. This was not accepted by the master and chief officer. The crew remained on board and were kept under daily observation until the vessel sailed for Leith, and the facts were reported to the Medical Officer of Health for that port. Before sailing, one of the engineers was taken ill with feverish symptoms, but the disease did not turn out to be Small-pox. The s.s. "Karin" (Swedish) arrived on the 24th January from Barcelona, and a case of Small-pox was removed therefrom to Denton Hospital. All necessary disinfection was carried out and the crew were vaccinated. Possible contacts: were taken ashore and bathed, and the vessel was kept under daily observation while in the port. On the 29th January, I received information from the Medical Officer of Health of Harrogate, that a case of Small-pox had been notified to him. It appeared that the patient had left Port Said on the 12th January travelling by the s.s. "Macedonia" to Marseilles, where he disembarked on 16th January. The date of onset of the disease appears to have been 23rd January. The s.s. "Macedonia" arrived at Gravesend on the 23rd January, when it was ascertained that no case of Small-pox or other infectious or contagious disease had occurred during the voyage. All were well on board on arrival. The vessel originally came from Sydney. Small-pox existed at Port Said, and it is probable that the patient was infected there and was incubating the disease whilst on the steamer, but did not develop the rash, &c., until after his arrival at Harrogate. The s.s. "Malwa," of Greenock, 127,543, arrived on the 6th February from Sydney, having landed a case of Small-pox at Gibraltar on the 2nd. All necessary disinfection was carried out there, and bedding, &c., thrown overboard. The names and addresses of all passengers and crew were taken and notified to the respective Medical Officers of Health. The number so notified was 122 passengers and 129 crew. No further case occurred, and the vessel was kept under daily observation while in the port. The s.s. "Mombassa," of Glasgow, 96,082, arrived from Calcutta on the 1st April. The vessel carried 134 natives as passengers to join a new ship in London. On the 7th March, one of these natives was attacked with Small-pox and was landed at Aden the same day. On the 23rd March, two of them developed Small-pox and were landed at Marseilles. The vessel and effects were disinfected at Genoa and Marseilles, and all the contacts were taken ashore at Marseilles and bathed. Vaccination of all was carried out. No further cases occurred, and on arrival at Gravesend all on board were found to be well. Some of the natives left the vessel to join a ship in Glasgow, and the Medical Officer of Health for that port was duly notified of the facts. Others joined a vessel in the Royal Albert Dock, and were kept under daily observation while in the port. The vessel sailed for Calcutta on the 4th April. The s.s. "Media," of Liverpool, 129,598, arrived on the 22nd May from Calcutta. On the 30th April a native Quartermaster was taken ill, and on the 2nd May Small-pox rash appeared on his face, forearms and feet. There was no fever after the 2nd May, and the patient had been vaccinated. He was isolated and landed at Suez on the 10th May. All disinfection was carried out and the native crew vaccinated. No further case occurred, and all were well on arrival at Gravesend. 20 On the 30th June, information was received that a man from the barque "Hudson," lying at Northfleet, was taken ill with shivering and pains in the stomach; he also had a suspicious rash. The man consulted a doctor and the case was notified as one of Small-pox. The case was removed to Denton Hospital. On July 1st, however, it was ascertained that the disease was not Small-pox but Measles. All necessary precautions and disinfection were adopted. Vaccination of the crew was performed. The s.s. "Nevasa," of Glasgow, 133,102, arrived on the 17th August from Calcutta, having landed a case of Small-pox at Colombo on the 28th July. The vessel was disinfected and the crew vaccinated. No further case occurred, and all were well on arrival at Gravesend. A circular letter dated 31st August, 1914, was received from the Local Government Board with regard to the measures to be taken to prevent the spread of Small-pox. The arrangements at Gravesend and Denton Hospital for dealing with such cases, which have proved efficient in previous epidemics, should prove equally satisfactory and sufficient to deal with any probable outbreak of Small-pox, TABLE XIII.

On the 26th April, 1914, I received a notification that a member of the crew of the s.s. "Portinglis," of West Hartlepool, 127,436, was suffering from Scarlet Fever. This vessel arrived from Antwerp on the 24th April, bound for the Surrey Commercial Dock. On the 26th April, the patient visited a doctor on account of a sore throat, was told that he had fever, but did not understand it was Scarlet Fever. Rash appeared on the 27th April. On the morning of the 27th April, the patient went to Mark Lane by train. On his return, he was confined to his room and was subsequently removed to Denton Hospital. He stated that he was not told that he was suffering from Scarlet Fever, and therefore, did not adopt any precautions. I communicated with the doctor who signed the notification certificate, and received a reply from him as follows:â€” "30th April, 1914. " Dear Sir, "s.s. 'Portinglis.' "When the patient, J. A., called on me on the 26th inst. I told him he was suffering from Scarlatina. "Faithfully yours, "H. L. A." The patient must of necessity, while suffering from Scarlet Fever, have been a source of risk to persons with whom he was in contact, and this is an illustration of the way in which Scarlet Fever may spread. 22 The s.s. "Galician," of Southampton, 113,334, arrived from East London on the 28th May, 1914. On the 29th I received information that a child, travelling with mother and another child, were landed at Southampton and proceeded to an address in Whitechapel, where the child was found to be suffering from Scarlet Fever. The child is reported to have been taken ill on the 11th May. No mention was made of any such case on arrival of the vessel at Gravesend. I therefore communicated with the owners of the vessel, asking for an explanation, and they replied as follows:â€” "4th June, 1914. "Sir, "s.s. 'Galician.' "In reply to your letter of yesterday, we have to inform you that a male child of Mrs. D. came under the treatment of the surgeon of this steamer on 12th May, the entry in the day book stating that he was suffering from sickness and pyrexia. On the 13th and 14th the child appears to have been very unwell. On the latter day with a temperature of 102 he was placed in the ship's hospital. On the 15th and 16th the patient was somewhat better, the morning temperature on the latter date being 100.4 and the evening temperature 101.2. On the morning of the 17th May the temperature was normal and it remained so until arrival at Southampton on the 27th ultimo. "Your obedient Servants, ".............................." It would therefore appear that the case was not diagnosed before arrival. TABLE XIV. (Diphtheria, including Membranous Croup.) Date. Name of Vessel, Port of Registry, and Official Number. Where from.

On arrival at Gravesend no sickness was reported, and the Master reported "all well on board." At about 10 a.m. on the 3rd June a fireman was sent to the Seamen's Hospital, and was diagnosed as suffering from Enteric Fever. I communicated with the owners of the vessel asking for an explanation, and the following is a copy of their reply:â€” 8th June, 1914. "Dear Sir, "s.s. 'Katori Maru.' "With reference to your letter of 4th instant, re Fireman H. Y., sent to hospital from this steamer, we beg to say that we now have a reply from the steamer's surgeon. He states that the man had a 'cold' ten days before he was sent to hospital, but recovered in a few days. He was quite well when he arrived in London on Tuesday morning the 2nd instant. On Tuesday evening he was feverish, and after careful examination was suspected of typhoid, when he was immediately isolated. The Master's report that there was no sickness on board on steamer's arrival at Gravesend on 1st instant was given in good faith, and we trust you will accept this explanation. "Yours faithfully, " " 25 The following is a copy of a further letter from the owners:â€” " 11th June, 1914. "Dear Sir, "s.s. 'Katori Maru.' "We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, copy of which we are sending to the Master, the steamer having left for Japan. We trust the Port Sanitary Committee will not take too serious a view of the incident. We might urge in extenuation that the Master's reply that he had had no sickness on the voyage was literally true, as the voyage in question was only from Antwerp, and the man was thought to have recovered from his 'cold' before departure of the steamer from Antwerp. Meanwhile, we are emphasising to our captains the necessity of faithfully reporting all suspected cases of sickness, and we trust that you will not be troubled by any such future occurrences. "Yours faithfully, "..........................................." The s.s. "Grainton," of Newcastle, 129,766, arrived on the 19th September, 1914, from Galveston, and seven cases of this disease were landed at Denton Hospital. The vessel was at Galveston August 19th-27th, where water was taken on board from a stand pipe on the quay. The men state, however, that there was a water barrel on the quay, the contents of which was used for drinking purposes. This was filled from time to time, and negroes put blocks of ice in it. Of the men who subsequently developed Enteric Fever all except one partook freely of this water over a period of eight days. Six cases occurred between September 1st and 12th, and one on September 18th. The latter patient was probably infected from the two earliest cases, who were attended to by him when they became ill. Of the seven cases, six made a good recovery and one died. On the 21st October, 1914, I received a notification that two men had been admitted to the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, from the s.s. "F. A. Tamplin," on the 13th September, and that the disease had been diagnosed as typhoid fever. This vessel arrived on the 11th September, and proceeded to Thames Haven, and received pratique from H.M. Customs, the Master stating that there had been no illness on board. It is obvious that the two men in question must have been ill on arrival of the vessel at Thames Haven, and I therefore communicated with the Master asking for an explanation. The following is a copy of a letter sent by the Master to his owners, dated 11th December, 1914 :â€” "Regarding the two enteric fever cases which the Medical Officer of Health mentioned, the two men had been ill on the passage, but not of such a nature as to be reported as illnesses. I treated them to the best of my ability, and they had recovered and were on deck on arrival in London. These two men it appears ate something at Thames Haven, and, as all our food had to be cooked on shore, I cannot be responsible for water or anything the men got hold of, but the fact remained that during the time of my arrival in Thames Haven and Woolwich Buoys, these two men complained of feeling ill, and on arrival at Woolwich Buoys I immediately called the Doctor down to examine them ; he 26 was unable to advise me as to what they were suffering from, but suggested they be sent to Greenwich Hospital, which was done. This is the first intimation that I have had that they were suffering from enteric fever. As to their illness at sea, I am not a medical man, therefore the slight illness they had on the voyage I cannot say what it was, but as before stated, the health of these two men was sufficient on arrival at Thames Haven as not to hinder me from stating truthfully that there was no sickness on board, nor had there been any serious illness during the passage," I replied stating that the Master should not take the responsibility of stating that all are well on board, but should report every case of illness on arrival at Gravesend.

The s.s. "Rotorua," of Plymouth, 124,587, arrived from Wellington on the 15th August, when it was ascertained that the second cook, age 29 years, worked up to the 19th June, when he reported sick, and was found to be suffering with advanced Pulmonary Tuberculosis. He died on the 3rd July. The cabin, bedding and clothing were thoroughly disinfected. The s.s. "Durham Castle," of London, 118,587, arrived from Beira on the 11th December, when it was ascertained that the assistant cook was suffering with Pulmonary Tuberculosis. The s.s. "Inanda," of Aberdeen, 118,187, arrived from Beira on the 14th December, when a fireman was found to be suffering with Pulmonary Tuberculosis. He was in an early stage of the disease and was able to do his work. He was paid off in London and his name and address were taken and notified to the Medical Officer of Health concerned. The infected cabin was disinfected and repainted out. 31 The fact that men suffering with detectable Pulmonary Tuberculosis should be employed as cooks indicates the desirability of a medical examination being made before engaging any man employed on board ship in the preparation of food, apart from the risk to those occupying the same quarters of being affected with the same disease.

The facts were reported to the Local Government Board and the London County Council, and all necessary disinfection was carried out. ANTHRAX. On the 4th June, I received information that H. T., aged 37, was admitted to the London Hospital suffering from Anthrax. The patient was reported to be a waterside labourer and was employed carting horses' hides. He is reported to have been last at work on the s.s. "Cawdor Castle" in the East India Dock on the 2nd June. I therefore made immediate enquiries and ascertained that no hides had been discharged from this vessel in the Port of London. I received information that the patient was discharged from hospital on the 21st June, having recovered from Anthrax. COMPULSORY NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

W. Weddel and Co., Ltd., the total receipts of all kinds of frozen and chilled meats in 1914 amounted to 694,456 tons, as against 720,661 tons in 1913. Out of 200,875 tons of frozen beef imported, only 101,440 tons were produced within the British Empire. Further, that more than sixty per cent, of the beef, mutton and lamb consumed in the United Kingdom is still produced in the British Isles, The world's export of frozen and chilled meat in 1914 is estimated at 800,413 tons, compared with 766,910 tons in 1913, and 678,658 tons in 1912. BEEF. The total importations of beef (frozen and chilled), from all sources aggregated 5,788,147 quarters, of which:â€” Australia contributed 1,236,466 frozen quarters. New Zealand â€ž 321,784 â€ž â€ž South America â€ž 1,308,868 ,, â€ž â€ž â€ž â€ž 2,865,022 chilled â€ž United States ,, 55,307 frozen â€ž South Africa â€ž 700 â€ž â€ž Total 5,788,147 quarters. The number of quarters discharged from vessels in the Port of London was 2,426,505 or 41'92 per cent, of the total imported, being an increase of 374,393 quarters compared with 1913. With very few exceptions the beef arrived in good condition, and your officers only found it necessary to seize as unfit for human food 926 hinds and crops, 426 pieces, and a quantity of trimmings, the total weight of which was 82 tons 9 cwts. qrs. 26 lbs., being upwards of 50 tons in excess of the previous year's total. The largest seizure made was about 21 tons, and particulars in respect of this are given on page 49. AUSTRALIAN BEEF AFFECTED WITH "WORM" (ONCHOCERCA). In only one instance was Australian beef found to be affected with "worm." The consignment consisted of 398 buttocks, which arrived on the 22nd January, was examined by one of your Food Inspectors, and "worm " nests (Onchocerca) found in 49 of them = 12*3 per cent. One hundred and sixty-one hind-quarters of beef of a different mark from the same ship were carefully examined and " worm "nests found in 6 of them = 3-72 per cent. The meat bore the Official Certificate of the Commonwealth of Australia, as approved by the Local Government Board. 38 Subsequently a systematic examination of beef arriving from Australia was made, and in the course of a 10 percentage examination of 11,435 hind-quarters, 168 crops, and 467 buttocks, small " worm" nests were found in only 5 hind-quarters. Four hundred and seventy-one crops of beef, which arrived on the s.s. " Marere," from Australia, on the 3rd March, were found not cut in accordance with the Regulations made by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, an insufficient quantity having been cut off the wing end of the fore-quarter. The joints were really fore-quarters with the brisket and part of the flank removed. Each crop was examined, but not a single u worm " was found. MUTTON AND LAMB. The total importations of frozen mutton 'and lamb into the United Kingdom from Australia, New Zealand and South America was :â€” From Australia .... 3,722.830 carcases. ,, New Zealand ... 6,181,184 â€ž â€ž South America 2,884,825 â€ž Total 12,788,839 carcases. Although this shows a decrease of 147,326 carcases, or 1.1 per cent, on the total for 1913, the number of carcases discharged from vessels in the Port of London, namely 8,496,735, was an increase of 157,621 carcases on the previous year and represented 66'43 per cent, of the whole quantity landed in the United Kingdom from the above-mentioned countries. The total quantity seized by your officers as unfit for human food and destroyed comprised 5,844 carcases, 1,142 pieces and a quantity of trimmings, weighing 161 tons 11 cwts. 1 qr. 22 lbs., being upwards of 27 tons in excess of the total of the previous year. The largest seizure was about 113 tons, and particulars of this are given on page 49. Although quantities of mutton and lamb arrived from the Continent, your officers did not find it necessary to seize any. PORK. The pork seized and destroyed, namely 236 carcases and 2 pieces, shows a considerable increase compared with the previous year, when the total was only 4 carcases and 6 pieces. 39 Of the total, 228 were seized on account of tuberculosis, 1 was dropsical, 3 were affected with abscesses, 3 carcases and 2 pieces were putrid, 1 was an illegal importation inasmuch as the glands about the neck and throat had been removed. It was destroyed at the request of the consignees, in order to avoid the expense of re-exporting it. 128 were from Holland. 10 â€ž â€ž Belgium. 97 ,, â€ž Argentina. 1 carcase and 2 pieces were from New York. The weight was 11 tons 6 cwts. 1 qr. 27 lbs. One of your Food Inspectors, while examining a consignment of 323 pig-carcases from Argentina, which arrived on the 10th November, found three of the carcases covered with a profuse rash. Specimens of the skin taken from the carcases were submitted to Dr. H. B. Newham, Director of the London School of Tropical Medicine, who reported as follows :â€” "Received 16th November, 1914, several pieces of pig skin taken from the face of a pig's carcase, and presenting a number of small round nodules projecting on the surface. " On examining the skin it is seen to be studded with numerous whitish nodules varying in size from that of a mustard seed to that of a small pea, and closely resembling acne pustules. In some portions of the skin, especially that taken from just below the eye, these nodules were very thickly set indeed. " The individual nodules were in some cases urnbilicated. " On opening the nodules they were seen to contain a thick sebaceous material. Some of this was transferred to a slide and teased up with a little saline solution. On examining this with a microscope there were seen very numerous parasites of the family Demodicidse, mixed with a certain amount of sebaceous material. " By suitable treatment it was found possible to abstract the sebaceous material and so get the Demodicidse free. " It was then seen that the parasites were of three kindsâ€”males, females, larvae, all of which were found lying together in one and the same nodule. " The males are provided with eight short legs, a mouth apparatus and an annulated abdomen, and measure some 205w. in length, 60w. in breadth. 40 " The females are somewhat larger, measuring some 230w. in length by 60w. in breadth. They also are possessed oÂ£ eight legs, mouth apparatus and annulated tapering abdomen, but are distinguished by the possession of an egg sac situated in the interior portion of the abdomen. " The larvÃ¦ differ from the adults mainly in only possessing six legs, in possessing no developed sexual apparatus, and in their smaller size. Their measurements are 160w. long and 45w. broad. " Section of the skin showed that these nodules appeared to arise in the sebaceous glands converting same into little cysts lined by fairly dense fibrous material, and containing sebaceous material and crowds of parasites. " Parasites of the genus demodex have been described in various animals, including, man, dog, cat, pig, ox, hare, sheep, horse, fox, deer, bat, rat. and field mouse. In the last named it was first described as Zschokke. " The species occurring in the pig is known as demodex foliculorum (var. suis.). " It does appear to be of common occurrence in the pig. It was first described in that animal by Csokok in 1878. Since then it has been noted by Neumann, Wright, and Lindquist. i! These observers state that the favourite site for the activities is in the skin of the groin. It is also found on the neck, the brisket, the flanks, and the internal aspect of the legs, but they do not mention the skin of the face as part affected by the ravages of the pest. " The general health of any of the hosts attacked by these parasites does not seem to be affected, and the disease is a purely local affair." It does not render the carcase unfit for human food, after the affected part has been removed. PIG-CARCASES FROM CHINA. The s.s.

"Highland Piper," from Argentina, arrived on the 14th March. There was on board an experimental consignment of " Chilled " offal, comprising : â€” 2 bags of Ox-tails. 1 bag of Ox-hearts. 2 bags of Ox-tongues. The whole of the ox-tails and hearts, together with 21 out of 24 of the ox-tongues, were putrid. They were seized and destroyed in the usual way, and as the experiment was not a success, it probably will not be repeated. TINNED MEATS. The tinned meats seized and destroyed comprised:â€” Tons.

This comprised 16 tins, weighing 28 lbs. These had been rejected by the owners and were seized by the Port Sanitary Authority to prevent sale to small buyers. POULTRY AND GAME. This consisted of one package, weighing 16 lbs. 44 FISH. Although the quantity of wet and dried fish seized was about normal, a considerable increase is shown under the headings of " Herrings " and " Sundries." In the case of tinned Herrings, two consignments of 512 cases and 48 cases respectively had been shipped from this country to Western Australia where they were seized by the Public Health Authorities and condemned, owing to the fact that on analysis, tin in dangerous quantities was found to be present. The goods were returned to this country consigned to the Agent-General for Western Australia, who brought the matter to the notice of your Medical Officer of Health. The goods were seized by your officers on arrival in the Port of London, and an analysis of a number of tins agreed with that made by the Health Authorities in Western Australia. They were, therefore, with the consent of the owners, destroyed in the usual way. The increase coming under the heading of "Sundries" is represented by two seizures of various kinds of tinned fish on " Naval prizes." The total quantity seized and destroyed included :â€” Tons.

There was upwards of 350 tons decrease in this class of goods seized and destroyed, compared with the previous year. As in previous years, the dates seized as unfit for food, proved to be of some commercial value for the manufacture of vinegar, and they were accordingly released for that purpose, the Medical Officers of Health of the districts to which the goods were proceeding being notified of the facts. The goods destroyed included:â€” Tons. Cwts. Qrs. Lbs.

The greater part of the tea and cheese included in the following list formed part of the damaged cargo of a vessel which had been sunk in the River Thames whilst outward bound. The tea was subsequently used for the extraction of caffeine. The margarine formed part of the stores of a " Naval prize." With regard to the condensed milk, 321 cases, weighing 6 tons 9 cwts. 3 qrs. 3 lbs., were destroyed, 83 cases and 45 tins, weighing 1 ton 13 cwts. 1 qr. 14 lbs., were used for poultry feeding, and 43 cases, weighing 1 ton 2 cwts., were released for confectionery purposes. The milk used for poultry food and confectionery purposes was only allowed to leave the district of the Port Sanitary Authority after your Medical Officer of Health had received a satisfactory guarantee respecting it and the Medical Officers of Health of the district to which the goods were proceeding were furnished with full particulars.

The quantity seized was 3 tons 6 cwts. 2 qrs. 24 lbs. Most of it was Rummage Sale goods, and was dealt with in the same way as the grain. SUGAR. The total quantity of Sugar destroyed was 65 tons 19 cwts. 2 qrs. 10 lbs., and in respect of the greater part of this the following is of interest :â€” The s.s. " Lime Branch," from Peru, arrived on the 16th March and discharged her cargo, amongst which were 12,625 sacks of crude borate and also 7,737 sacks of sugar. When the sugar had been delivered, it was found that many of the sacks were coated on the exterior with the borate. An examination of the borate showed that it contained arsenic in dangerous quantities, and samples of the sugar taken from the surface of the sugar also contained arsenic. Consignments of the sugar had already been delivered in West Ham, Battersea, Stepney and Poplar. The bags of sugar contaminated with borate which went to Battersea, Stepney and Poplar were returned to the district of this Authority and dealt with under the supervision of your Officer. The bags were opened, the surface of the sugar scraped off to the extent of halfan-inch, and the sound sugar placed in new, clean bags. Of a total of 3,936 bags returned to the Dock for sorting, 419 were found to be sound and 3,517 were damaged. From the damaged bags 61 tons 4 cwts. 2 qrs. 4 lbs. of sugar was scraped off as unfit for human food, the remainder being passed as fit for human food. The s.s. " Ville du Havre," from Peru, which arrived on the 15th May, was also found to contain bags of sugar contaminated with borate. In all, 479 bags were examined and 276 found to be contaminated. These were dealt with in the same manner as those from the " Lime Branch," and resulted in 1 ton 11 cwts. 0 qrs. 19 lbs. of the sugar being rejected as unfit for human food. EGGS. No eggs were seized during the year. Fifteen barrels of egg yolk, weighing 2 tons 1 cwt. 1 qr., were seized on board a " Naval prize." These were disposed of by the owners, and released under a satisfactory guarantee for leather dressing. PREPARED FOODS. rhese included:â€” Cwts. qrs. lbs.

PUBLIC HEALTH (FOREIGN MEAT) REGULATIONS, 1908. During the year Notices were served under Articles III. (5), IY. (1) and VI. of the above-mentioned Regulations, for the exportation of the following meat:â€” Date of Arrival. Name of Vessel. Where from. Where lying.

Dec. 4 s.s. " El Paraguayo " Do. Do. 1 pig-carcase. * These goods were found in a case marked " 2 dozen sheep-plucks." On examination the case was found to contain 14 sheep-plucks and 10 pig-plucks. The goods were destroyed at the request of the consignees in order to avoid the expense of exporting them. The s.s. "La Blanca," from Argentina, which was due to arrive in London on the 17th February, did not arrive until the 29th March. The bulk of the cargo consisted of meat, and it was obvious that as the voyage was prolonged the cargo would require special attention. There was a rumour that No. 1 Hold contained water, and on opening up that hold it was found that the whole of the contents required most careful and detailed examination. This hold contained 49 about 18,494 carcases of mutton, and of these nearly 15,000 were put into Dock Store for special examination and cutting, while 3,447 were seized on the vessel and delivered overside into lighters for destruction. In addition 190 quarters of beef which were seized at the ship's side and delivered to vans for destruction, a large number were sent to the Dock Store for further examination and trimming. This was carried out under the supervision of your Inspectors and occupied them for a fortnight. The examination and cutting of the mutton by a gang of butchers under a foreman, and supervised by an Inspector, occupied three weeks. As a result of the examination, the following meat was found to be unfit for human food and destroyed :â€” Muttonâ€”383 carcases. 684 pieces. 40 bags, shoulders and loins. Beefâ€”189 fore-quarters. 26 hind-quarters. 241 pieces. 83 bags trimmings. 4 cases and 4 bags boneless chucks. Offalâ€”99 cases sheep-hearts. 2 bags ox-tails. 1 bag and 14 cases ox-hearts. 1 bag and 20 cases ox-cheeks. 6 bags ox-skirts. 2 cases thick skirts. The total weight of meat destroyed was 142 tons 1 cwt. 1 qr. 27 lbs. TABLE XXXII. ACTINOMYCOSIS IN OX-TONGUES IMPORTED FROM ARGENTINA. With reference to the above subject, referred to in my last Annual Report, the examination of ox-tongues which arrived in the Port of London during the year under review, was continued with a view to detecting the presence of the disease.

The above consignments represent only a proportion of the tongues which arrived. The remainder were allowed to leave the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority (without inspection) for removal to Cold Stores within the City of London, and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Bermondsey and Finsbury, to be examined there under the supervision of the Medical Officers of Health of those districts. Actinomycosis in ox-tongues was also found in two consignments which arrived from Australia. In a consignment of 144 tongues examined, 1 tongue was found affected, and in another consignment of 207 tongues, 13 (â€” 6'28 per cent.) were found affected. 51 TABLE XXXIII.

On the 25th March, I received a complaint relating to the condition of a barge laden with paper and rags, sunk in Puddle Dock. I visited the locality with the Sanitary Inspector on the 27th March. There was no nuisance, but with a view to preventing the possibility of one arising, the barge was unloaded into another craft and the cargo removed from the Dock. Complaints were made with reference to dust arising from the coal wharf inside Poplar Dock, facing the London County Council Buildings, Prestons Road, Poplar. At this part of the dock barges are loaded from trucks, the practice being to raise the truck some 10 to 11 feet and then tilting it, to discharge the contents at one operation into the barge. In the course of this process much inconvenience is experienced owing to the blowing of coal dust into the dwellings. The facts were laid before Mr. Solicitor, but although there might be a nuisance, it was not one Avhich could be dealt with summarily under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The s.s. " Italian Prince " brought as part cargo a quantity of bones ; these were stowed under the poop adjoining the store room which was not effectively cut off from the space in which the bones were stowed. This space was swarming with maggots and beetles, and on examination the sugar and biscuits forming part of the stores for use of the crew were found to contain these creatures. The stores were accordingly destroyed. RIVER THAMES. On the 1st January, a large quantity of oil was noticed floating on the surface of the water in the vicinity of Blackwall. On investigation it was traced to an oil lighter which was moored at Folly House Buoys, which craft was being cleaned out at the time. The matter was brought to the notice of the owners and persons in charge of the lighter. On the 28th March, effluent was observed being discharged from the Crossness Outfall Sewage Works. It was young flood at the time, and the effluent formed a thick brownish scum which gave off a strong odour. On the 29th and 30th April, a similar discharge was observed. On the 27th May, a discharge was observed from the Northern Outfall Sewage Works at Barking on the young flood. The effluent from the outfall at Barking and Crossness is kept under observation by the Port of London Authority, and I understand analyses of the effluent are regularly made. 53 TABLE XXXIV.

An additional fireproof safe was obtained in November for the accommodation of the principal official books, the number and size of these having considerably increased in late years with the expansion of business and staff. STAFF. Office.â€”James Arthur Gillis was appointed as Junior Clerk, in the place of James George Godden, resigned. Inspectors.â€”William J. Berry was appointed as a Sanitary Inspector, and in June was promoted to be a Third Class Inspector, having obtained by examination the Certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute as a Sanitary Inspector. Hospital.â€”Mr. and Mrs. Stone were appointed as Caretakers, in the place of Mr. and Mrs. Wragg. They resigned their position, which was filled by Mr. and Mrs. Lewis. 58 Miss A. Densham and Miss A. A. Foggo resigned their appointments as Assistant Nurses, and the vacancies were filled by Miss M. Mummery and Miss A. Maynard. Miss Mummery resigned, and Miss C. M. Pleace was appointed in her place. Mrs. A. V. Davies was appointed as Staff" Nurse. Elizabeth Brooks was appointed as Cook, and Ellen Hutson as Housemaid. "Lady Truscott."â€”A. F. Rough was appointed as Deckhand in the place of 0. Boyd, who left, the Port Sanitary Committee having no further use for his services, and W. Mclntier as temporary Stoker in the place of A. E. Howard, who was called up for Naval Service. " David Burnett."â€”J. Steen appointed as Engineer in the place of G-. H. Bagshaw. E. Martin appointed as temporary Deckhand in the place of J. Baulsom serving with H.M. Forces. Services of a stoker 011 the Greenwich Station discontinued. CD " George Briggs."â€”W. H. Buzzel appointed as Mechanic in the place of J. Steen. " Collingwood."â€”G. H. Bagshaw appointed as Watchman until he resigned on the 2nd January, 1915. Edward Ditch appointed as Watchman in the place of W. H. Buzzel. The following members of the Staff are serving with His Majesty's Forces :â€” Boarding Medical Officer - Dr. J. S. Warrack, Lieut.-Colonel, R.A.M.C., T.F. Office, Junior Clerk - - T. J. S. Cotterell, Corporal, R.A.M.C., T.F. Launches, Deckhand J, Baulsom, R.F.A. â€ž Stoker C. Wilcox, Bombardier, R.F.A. â€ž â€ž A. E, Howard, Royal Navy. Watchman H. A. Clarkson, Royal Navy. Owing to the suspension of Medical Examination in connection with the Aliens Act, it has been found possible, with the co-operation of Dr. Willoughby and the Assistant Medical Officers, to carry on the duties of Medical Inspection, &c., at Gravesend and Sheerness, without any addition to the Medical Staff in place of Dr. Warrack ; owing to the scarcity of medical men it is even doubtful if an additional medical officer could have been obtained. Dr. W. M. Willoughby was formally appointed by the Port Sanitary Committee, Deputy Medical Officer of Health. This appointment will increase the efficiency of the Service. The duties of the Junior Clerk have been performed by the other members of the Clerical Staff without additional help. Substitutes have been engaged temporarily in the place of Baulsom, Wilcox, Howard and Clarkson. Those members of the Staff absent on service have received the difference between their service pay and that received from the Corporation, and their places will be kept open until they return. 59 LAUNCHES. The launch "Clotho" was disposed of on the 16th December. She was a most useful economical boat, and should be replaced by a motor launch, which should be of shallow draft, suitable for landing cases of illness at the Causeway at Denton Hospital. "George Briggs," motor launch.â€” The period of guarantee terminated during the year, and I had the launch surveyed by your Consulting Engineers. The engines we're found to be in excellent condition, but the shaft had worn in the bearings and required renewing. The "David Burnett" continues to work satisfactorily, but as her toiler is now 22 years old, the probability of renewal in the near future may have to be considered. MOORING BARGE " COLLINGWOOD." Some of the links of the mooring chain were found to be badly chafed. These were overhauled by the Port of London Authority, and made good where required. A check was also provided to prevent a recurrence of the chafing. The general condition of this barge is not good, and another should be obtained when the time is propitious for getting a suitable one. FUMIGATING APPARATUS, BARGE "THOMAS." The fumigating plant was used on 11 occasions during the year, the largest ship fumigated being one of 7,137 tons, with a cubic capacity of 550,000 cubic feet. TABLE XXXIX. Date. Name of Vessel.

The limits of the Port of London as at present defined commence at High Water Mark in the River Thames at Teddington Lock, in the County of Surrey, and extend down both sides of the River Thames to an imaginary straight line drawn from the Pilot Mark at the entrance of Havengore Creek, in the County of Essex, to the Lands end at Warden Point, in the Isle of Sheppey, in the County of Kent, such point being the North-Western limit of the Port of Faversham, and shall extend up and include both sides of the River Med way to an imaginary straight line drawn from the SouthEast point of land Westward of Coalmouth Creek, thence across the said River Medway to the Westernmost point of the piece of land which forms the Eastern side of the Stangate Creek, or, in other words, the North-West point of Fleet Marsh, and from thence in a Southerly direction to Iwade Church, in the said County of Kent, and thence in a North-Easterly direction to Elmley Chapel, in the said Isle of Sheppey, a supposed direct line from Elmley Chapel to Iwade Church, being the Western limit of the Port of Faversham, and the said Port of London shall include the Islands of Havengore Creek aforesaid, called Potton and Rushley Islands, and so much of the said Creek and watercourse as extends from it to the town of Rochford, and shall also include all other islands, rivers, streams, creeks, waters, watercourses, channels, harbours, docks and places within the before-mentioned limits contained. CANAL BOATS ACTS. In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith my Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, during the year ending 31st December, 1914. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole of the district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the river and docks â€”as a "canal," for the purposes of the Act, includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or is not within the ebb or flow of the tide. The navigation in addition to the enclosed docks, includes the following navigable tributary waters and creeks of the River Thames :â€” On the right bank from Teddington downwards :â€” Wandsworth Creek (River Wandle). Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Surrey Commercial Docks. Hay's Dock. St. Saviour's Dock. Deadman's Dock. Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). The entrance to the Gravesend Canals. Cliffe Creek. Yantlet and Coalmouth Creeks. Part of the river Medway, and of the Swale. 61 On the left bank from Teddington downwards:â€” The entrance to the River Brent. Chelsea Dock. Grosvenor Dock. Limekiln Creek. Part of the River Lea. Barking Creek (River Roding). Rainham Creek (River Ingrebourne). Mucking Creek. Thames Haven. Hole Haven. Potton and Rushley Creeks. River Roach as far up as Rochford. The whole of this area is divided into three districts, known as the Upper, Middle and Lower, each district being in charge of an Inspector, as follows :â€” RIVER. Upper District. Teddington to Greenwich. Inspector Burr - 2081, per annum. Inspector El ward - - - 18 21. ,, Middle District. Greenwich to Erith. Inspector Shepherd - - - 156/. per annum. Lower District. Erith to seaward limits of the Port of London (including part of the River Medway). Inspector Berry - - - 104/. per annum. t The Docks are divided into four districts, known as the Central, Eastern, Western and the Gravesend district. Central District. West India Dock. South West India Dock. Poplar Dock. Millwall Dock. Inspector Lambe 208l. per annum. 62 Eastern District. Royal Victoria Dock. East India Dock. Inspector Garland 208/. per annum. Royal Albert Dock. Inspector Wetjen ... 208/. per annum. Western District. London Dock. St. Katherine's Dock. Regent's Dock. Inspector Hopkins 208/. per annum. Surrey Commercial Dock. Inspector Rolfe 208/. per annum. Gravesend District. / Tilbury Dock. Left Shore, from Purfleet down. Right Shore, from Erith down. Inspector Massie 175/. 10s. per annum. (2) The total number of inspections for the year was 571, representing a net number of 237 boats. The remainder, 334, represents repeated visits by Inspectors of this Authority. The number of boats not conforming to the Acts and Regulations was 73 (inspected on 98 occasions, or 12.78 per cent, of the total inspections, the percentage for the previous five years being 9.39 per cent.). In addition to the above, 9 boats were at the time of visit found with the cabin doors locked, there being no person on board. Inspection was therefore impossible, and these visits are not included in the number of boats inspected. (3) With reference to the various infringements of the Act: â€” Unregistered Boats. The following boats were found, on inspection, to be unregistered within the meaning of the Act:â€” 63 Date. Name of Boat. Registration Authority. Reason for Registration or Re-registration. 1914.
