TED 18 District of Teddington. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health TO BE PRESENTED TO THE Urban District Council of Teddington 1906. KNAPP, DREWETT AND SONS LIMITED, TEDDINGTON AND KINGSTON. 30,396. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE URBAN DISTRICT OP TEDDINGTON For the year 1906. To the Chairman and, Members of the Urban District Council of Teddington. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the Mortality, Health, and Sanitary Condition of your District for the year 1906. AREA AND INHABITED HOUSES. The area of the Urban District of Teddington contains 1,214 acres. The Land Area is 1,196 acres, and the Water Area is 18 acres. This area is situated in the southern part of the County of Middlesex, and extends from the River Thames on the eastern side to the Rural District of Staines on the western side, a distance of about three miles. The District is bounded on the north by the Urban District of Twickenham, and adjoins the Urban Districts of Hampton Wick and Hampton on 4 its southern side. The District is divided into four wards, viz., Fulwell, Upper Teddington, Lower Teddington, and South Teddington. The Fulwell Ward is situated at the western end of the District, and the South Teddington Ward at the eastern end. The number of inhabited houses at the time of the Census of 1901 was 2,754. In the middle of the year 1906 there were 3,509 inhabited houses. Of late years a great many new houses have been erected in Teddington, more especially in the Fulwell and South Teddington Wards. POPULATION. The following table shows the enumerated population of the District at the last Census in 1901, and at the previous Census in 1891, and also> the estimated population in June 1900. Population (enumerated) Population Estimated Middle 1906. 1891. 1901. 10,025 14,037 17,000 The estimated population of your District is based upon the number of inhabited houses in the District at the end of June, 1906. multiplied by the average number of persons per house which obtained at the date of the last Census. BIRTHS. The births of 438 children were registered in your District during 1900, which gives a birth-rate on the estimated population of 25.76 per 1,000 living. Of 5 these 438 children, 227 were males and 211 were females. There were eight illegitimate children, three of which were males and five females. The birth-rates of various localities are as follows:— 1905. 1906. England and Wales 27.2 27 London 27.1 26.7 County of Middlesex 27.3 Teddington 23.3 25.8 Teddington Average for years 1896-1905—24.1. DEATHS. The total number of deaths of residents of Teddington, fully corrected for deaths occurring and registered outside the District during 1906, is 238. This number is considerably greater than the corresponding numbers in previous years, and is no doubt to be accounted for by the great increase of the population in recent years. The nett number of deaths belonging to the District is calculated as follows:— M. F. Total Deaths registered in the District 105 112 217 Deaths of Teddington Residents— In the Kingston Union Infirmary 9 9 18 „ Surbiton Cottage Hospital 1 — 1 „ Brompton Hospital 2 — 2 „„ West London Hospital — 1 1 „ Wandsworth Asylum 1 2 3 In Private Houses in other districts — 2 2 Found drowned in other districts — 2 2 Complete Total 118 128 246 6 Deaths of Non-residents— M. F. Total In the Teddington and Hampton Wick Cottage Hospital 4 3 7 Found Drowned and taken out of the River Thames in the District 1 1 Total 5 3 8 Deducting this total from the Complete Total we obtain the Nett Total of all deaths belonging to the District 113 125 238 The death-rates for various localities per 1,000 persons living are as follows:— 1901. 1905. 1906. England and Wales 16.9 15.2 15.4 London 18.7 15.8 15.1 County of Middlesex 14 12.2 — Teddington Recorded Death Rate 9.55 11.5 14 Teddington Corrected Death Rate 10.00 12 14.66 Teddington average for preceding 10 years 12.86 12.23 11.88 The Corrected Death-Rate is arrived at— (1) By the exclusion of the deaths of non-residents which occurred and were registered in Teddington. (2) By the inclusion of the deaths of residents of Teddington which occurred and were registered elsewhere ; and (3) By allowing for the disturbing influence caused by the age and sex distribution of the population. 7 CAUSES OF DEATHS. The various causes contributing to the deaths (fully corrected) belonging to Teddington are shown in Table [V They include the following:— Measles 6 Whooping Cough 3 Enteric Fever 1 Epidemic Influenza 4 Diarrhœa 21 Puerperal Fever 1 Other Septic Diseases 6 Phthisis 19 Other Tuberculous Diseases 6 Cancer 16 Bronchitis 15 Pneumonia 20 Pleurisy 2 Other Diseases of the Respiratory Organs 4 Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver 3 Premature Birth 9 Diseases and Accidents of Parturition 1 Heart Diseases 23 Accidents 4 Suicides 4 Diabetes 4 Acute Rheumatism 2 Pernicious Anaemia 1 Intestinal Obstruction 2 Old Age 17 All other causes 44 238 Of these, 113 were males and 125 females; 53 were under 1 year of age and 71 were over 65 years of age. 8 INFANTILE MORTALITY. This death-rate is based upon the number of deaths of children under one year of age, and is expressed as a proportion of such deaths to the births registered during the same period. The total number of such deaths belonging to Teddington for 1906 is 53. This is slightly greater than the number in recent years but the rate of infantile mortality is less than the average infantile death-rate for the previous ten years. This is due to the fact that the numbers of births is considerably in excess of the number for other years. Infantile Mobtality per 1,000 Births. Year. Teddington. Middlesex. London. England & Wales. Births Deaths Rate per 1,000 Births. 1901 359 40 111 133 149 151 1902 351 49 139 129 141 133 1903 419 40 95 117 131 132 1904 391 50 128 136 146 146 1905 381 42 110 107 131 128 1906 438 53 121 - 130 133 The factors which have influence in causing the deaths of infants are complex. Probably meteorological conditions have influence in any one year in producing a higher or lower number of infants' deaths. Thus, during the year 1906, 18 infants died of Diarrhoea, and 14 of these deaths occurred in August and September when the weather had been very hot for many weeks. In the whole of the previous year there were only 11 9 deaths from Diarrhœa. Again, Improper Feeding and General Neglect are other factors to be reckoned with. It may also be noticed that five infants under one year of age at the time of their death were illegitimate and only eight illegitimate births were registered in the District during the year. Since the year 1905 the Local Government Board have issued a new table (Table V.) which sets out a great number of details. The figures in the table for 1906 show— 1. That one-fourth of all the deaths under one year occurred before the end of the first month of life. 2. That 18 or one-third of the whole number died of Diarrhoea. 3. That Premature Birth is responsible for nine deaths out of 53, or roughly a sixth. 4. That the conditions known as Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus are credited with seven deaths, or about an eighth of the whole number. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. I.—Not Notifiable. MEASLES. There were six deaths of children under five years of age and they occurred between September and November in the Upper Teddington Ward. Isolated cases occurred in various parts of the District in the first and last quarters of the year. As the disease was more prevalent in the Upper Teddington and Fulwell Wards, where the Wellington Road School and the Victoria Schools are situated, I advised the teachers of those schools to watch the children carefully and send those home who had a bad cold, inflamed eyes or cough, and to exclude any child residing in an infected house. 10 When I inspected the Public Elementary School in South Teddington in December, I found that one-third of the children were absent principally because they were suffering from Measles or were living in an infected house. As this happened about a week prior to the Christmas holidays, I advised the Managers to give the children an extra week's holiday. My advice was adopted and when the children reassembled in January, an average number of pupils were present. It is interesting to note that there is close to this school the Roman Catholic School, which remained free from infection, although the majority of the children attending it, reside in the same neighbourhood. NOTIFICATION OF MEASLES. On August 17th a letter was received from the Hampton District Council asking your Council to consider the desirability of declaring Measles a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Notification Act. Your Council requested me to give them my opinion upon the subject and I made the following remarks:— "On account of the very infectious stage, before the skin eruption appears, the notification certificate would arrive too late to be of much value in the adoption of measures to protect others in the infected household. Generally, four days would elapse (during which the infection is at its highest) before the characteristic rash appears. Prior to the rash the disease cannot be diagnosed, and all those who are susceptible have probably been fully exposed to the infection. As the poor regard the disease very trivially, no medical man is called in; and cases occurring in small houses, often crowded with other children, and being the most potent for harm, would not be notified. 11 "Efficient home isolation in the houses of the poorer classes is generally impracticable, and without the means of hospital isolation the compulsory notification would be useless, and I should not advise its adoption. "It is significant to note that many Districts which included measles in the list of notifiable diseases have revoked the addition." In their reply to the Hampton Council your Council adopted my view. WHOOPING COUGH. This disease caused three deaths. They occurred in the early part of the year and in cases of children under five years of age. The number of cases of this disease was not great. Statistics show that this disease is more fatal than either Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria, and is, next to Measles, the disease most fatal to infant life. It is often very difficult to distinguish between a common cold and the early stage of Whooping Cough. This accounts for the spread of the disease, which is very infectious in its early stages when the child is attending school or mixing with other children. DIARRHŒA. Twenty-one deaths were registered, 18 being under one year of age, two under five, and one above the age of 65. Nearly all these deaths occurred in August and September. The infant mortality from this disease is 41 per 1,000 births. II.—Notifiable. SCARLET FEVER. Forty-two cases were notified and, with the exception of February, they occurred in every month of the 12 year and in various parts of the District. Five cases were notified between July 16th and 21st: one was in a girl and four in hoys. The boys were day scholars at a private school in Teddington. At the same period two boys residing in Hampton AVick and who attended that school were also notified as suffering from Scarlet Fever. As soon as I heard of the outbreak, I visited the school and found that, in addition, a boy living at Twickenham had also contracted the disease. All these boys had been sitting close to one another in the schoolroom. There could be no doubt that these cases were infected by an undetected case which would have occurred before July 15th. On further investigation I ascertained that two brothers of the girl, whose illness was notified on July 16th, attended that school and were absent from July 9th—14th, as they were suffering from soreness of their throats. In both cases the illness was of such a slight character that they were able to consult a medical man at his own house and no heed of the matter was taken. I examined these boys on July 26th and found them in the peeling stage. The acute stage of the disease had evidently been passed through without attracting special notice. These two undetected cases were directly and indirectly responsible for 16 others. The school was closed on July 17th and the premises were disinfected and cleaned. No death occurred and nearly all cases were of a mild type. One of the cases was removed to the Hampton Isolation Hospital, and one was sent to the London Fever Hospital. DIPHTHERIA. Only five cases were notified and there was no death. The mortality from this disease shows a great improvement, probably due to the early administration of antidiphtheritic serum in most cases. 13 ENTERIC FEVER. Six cases were notified, but two of these were sent in to the Teddington and Hampton Wick Cottage Hospital from another district where they had contracted the disease. The other four cases occurred in Teddington. In three of these the source of infection remained obscure; in the fourth the eating of oysters was a possible cause as the patient had partaken of that food. This was a very severe case and it proved fatal. One of the cases sent into the hospital from another district also proved fatal. PUERPERAL FEVER. Two cases were notified, one in January and the other in May. Both were attended by the same certified midwife. I informed the County Medical Officer and he investigated both cases, which were of a mild type. Both patients made a quick recovery. When the midwife had ceased to visit the patients, her premises, clothes, and bag with contents, were disinfected, and after taking baths she was allowed to attend other cases. The death from Puerperal Fever which is registered in Table IV. was that of a resident of Teddington who contracted the disease and died outside the district. DISINFECTION. Disinfection of rooms occupied by persons suffering from infectious diseases is carried out after removal of the patient by means of the Formalin Spray. As we have no steam disinfecting apparatus, articles of clothing, bedding, etc., are steeped in a solution of Jeyes' liquid and are then dried in the open air. Afterwards they can be washed. In some cases the walls are stripped and the ceilings whitewashed. 14 INSPECTION—MOUSE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE WORKING CLASSES. Apart from the General Inspection of the District in October and November I inspected six cottages in York Road in April, and I made a report to your Council on the condition of these houses. Two were empty and four were in a very dirty, dilapidated and insanitary condition and were found to be unfit for human habitation. After notice was served, the owner disposed of the property and the new proprietor put the cottages into good and habitable repair. After the adoption of Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, your Council selected a suitable site of over six acres of land for the erection of working men's dwellings. In order to obtain power to borrow £4,200 for the purchase of this land, the Local Government Inspector held an inquiry on November 9th. In connection with this inquiry your industrious and efficient Sanitary Inspector made a house-to-house inspection and obtained information as to rent, number of inmates and number of rooms in each cottage in the following roads, which are chiefly inhabited by weekly tenants:— York Road Victor Road Stanley Gardens Rd Shacklegate Lane Clifton Road Walpole Place Railway Road Latimer Road Cranmer Road Cranmer Place Argyle Road Church Lane West Road North Lane Park Lane Little Queen's Rd, Willoughby Road Springfield Road Field Lane Gomer Road Gomer Place Wade's Lane Watt's Lane Wick Road Bushey Park Terrace Fairfax Road School House Lane Munster Road The result of this investigation elicited the following facts. 15 That there are about 829 houses in the parish containing 4,454 persons of the labouring class. This gives an average population of 5'37 inhabitants per house. Four of these houses contains three families and 117 two families. The majority of the cottages are let at rents ranging from 7/- to 9/- per week. There are a lew let at 6/6 per week and under. Houses occupied by two families contain four, five or six rooms. Although these houses are not overcrowded to the extent that would justify my recommending proceedings, still, they contain more people than is desirable for consideration of health. The cottages are not adapted for two families and have only one kitchen, one wash-house, and one w.c. In my Report for 1905 I drew the Council's attention to the desirability, if possible, of making provision for housing the working classes. Suitable land in the District each year becomes scarcer and more difficult to obtain at a reasonable price, hence, unless measures are at once taken it will hereafter be impossible to make any provision. There can be little doubt that the over-populating of the houses referred to, is due to high rents and in my opinion it would be a great boon for many families who have to live in lodgings to be able to get a cottage at a rent which does not absorb one-third of a workman's wage. There should be no difficulty in providing houses that would be financially self-supporting and not chargeable upon the rates. The Scheme is now under the consideration of the Local Government Board. POLLUTION OF A WATERCOURSE. In the summer a complaint was received from the Twickenham Urban District Council regarding a nuisance arising from the discharge of offensive matter into a ditch on the boundary between the Teddington 16 and Twickenham Districts. I made several inspections and on one occasion was accompanied by Dr. Young, the Medical Officer of Health for the County of Middlesex. It was found that the pollution of the ditch chiefly arose from the discharge of offensive matter in the Hampton District, but that the Tramway Company, who are the owners of some land intersected by the ditch, contributed to the nuisance in a minor degree. A notice was served upon the Tramway Company to abate their participation in the nuisance, and the Hampton District Council was also communicated with and they promised to take steps to discontinue their share in the nuisance. DISUSED GRAVEL PITS. Several inspections of these pits were made during the summer months, as a nuisance arose in Minister Road from bad smells caused by the stagnant water. A notice was served upon the owner to abate the nuisance by filling the pit up to the water level. This notice was complied with. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. There are 14 Factories and 30 Workshops and Workplaces in the District. Only a few sanitary defects were found; these were caused by stopped drains, defective water closets and insufficient ventilation. The premises were inspected half-yearly. Only two out-workers were found in the District. They were makers of wearing apparel. They were notified by their employers. Their premises were inspected and found to be in a satisfactory condition. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. These were periodically inspected. In one instance the drains and the inspection chamber were found defective and in another case the water closets were found to be in an insanitary condition. On giving notice to the Managers the defects were at once remedied. 17 As soon as a child is notified as suffering from an infectious disease, a printed form giving name and address of the patient is sent to the teachers informing them of the occurrence. BAKEHOUSES. The twelve bakehouses and their premises were periodically inspected. In one case the regulations were not affixed, in another case limewashing was neglected, and in two cases the ceilings were defective. The place for storing flour was unsuitable in one instance. Verbal notices were given and were complied with. LAUNDRIES. We have two laundries in the District where machinery is used and five hand laundries. They were periodically inspected and most of them were found in good order. Notices had to be served in one instance with respect to defective floors and insufficient drainage. Two laundries had dirty walls and in one case manure was stored in the laundry grounds. All these defects were remedied. There are a number of small laundries in the District, where the work is done by one or two members of the family. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. There are nine Cowsheds and 20 Dairies and Milk,shops in the District. These were frequently inspected. The following defects were found and remedied upon notice being served, viz.:—two nuisances arising from accumulation of manure, one from a full cesspool, and two from dirty cowsheds. With these exceptions the places were kept in a satisfactory condition. 18 As it is of the greatest importance that pure milk from healthy cows should be supplied to the consumer, especially for the prevention of Tuberculosis and for the preservation of infant life, I advised your Council to appoint a Veterinary Surgeon who would be prepared to examine periodically the milking cows in the District. Your Council adopted my advice and received in December the following report from the Veterinary Surgeon:— "I hereby beg to announce that I have completed the second inspection of the milk cows of the Teddington District. Up to the present I have had to notify three cows to the Sanitary Inspector, and these cows have been disposed of by their owner. The cowkeeper who owned these cows that have been disposed of, allowed his other cows to be subjected to the Tuberculin Test, the result of which has been satisfactory." J. L. Still, m.r.c.v.s. The Sanitary Committee recommended that the Veterinary Inspector be instructed to test in future all doubtful cases, instead of allowing the owner to dispose of the animals. There are only 50 cows in the District. The greater part of the milk is obtained from neighbouring farms or from a distance by railway. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The six Slaughter-houses were found in a satisfactory condition. In one instance notice was given to remove accumulated manure. Another Slaughter-house required limewashing. 19 ICE CREAM SELLERS. There are a number of small shops in the District where ice creams are made in the summer and consumed on the premises. Handbills were distributed, to inform the sellers as to the provisions of the Act which came into operation on November 6th. No barrow men reside in the District, but several come from neighbouring parishes and sell the ice-creams in the streets. According to the Act, the name and address of the salesman must be placed on the the barrow to enable the Inspector to communicate with the Medical Officer of Health of the vendor's district, who will ascertain whether the provisions of the Act are carried out. The following are the principal clauses of the Act:— "Any person being a manufacturer of or merchant or dealer in Ice Cream or other similar commodity who within the County (a) Causes or permits Ice Cream or any similar commodity or any materials used in the manufacture thereof to be manufactured sold or stored in any sleeping room or in any room cellar or place which is in a condition likely to render such commodity injurious to health or in which there is an inlet or opening to a drain or (b) In the manufacture sale or storage of any such commodity does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination; or (c) Omits on the outbreak of any infectious disease amongst the persons employed in his business to give notice thereof forthwith to the Medical Officer of the District in which such business is carried on 20 shall be liable for every such offence on conviction in a Court of Summary Jurisdiction to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings. "Every itinerant vendor of any such commodity as aforesaid shall if not himself the manufacturer thereof exhibit in a legible manner on a conspicuous part of his barrow a notice stating the name and address of the person from whom he obtains such commodity and if such vendor is himself the manufacturer of such commodity he shall in the same manner exhibit his own name and address. Every such itinerant vendor who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this section shall be liable for each offence on conviction as aforesaid to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings." HOUSE REFUSE. The system of daily collection of refuse continues to work well as complaints are seldom received. At the general inspection very few places were found where there was an accumulation of refuse. SEWAGE DISPOSAL WORKS. The extension of these Works has now definitely been decided upon and the Surveyor's recommendations have been accepted by your Council and instructions have been given for the preparation of plans and other details. The scheme consists in additional pumping plant, bacterial tanks purification area, furnaces, and in enlargement of the buildings. This will cost about £27,000. DRAINAGE. Eighty-five connections have been made to the sewerage system, and an equal number to the surface water system. Through these connections the sewage from about 200 houses will ultimately flow. Eight cesspools have been closed. 21 SEWER VENTILATION. The ventilation of the sewers at the street level has been a source of a number of complaints during the year. The hot dry summer doubtless accounted for a good deal of this trouble. PRIVATE ROADS. The preliminaries with respect to Monster Road have been completed, and the sanction of the Local Government Board obtained to the making up of the road. Broom Water Road is still in a very dirty, insanitary condition. NEW BUILDINGS. Plans for the erection of 279 houses have been passed during the year. SANITARY STAFF. Mr. Wheeler, your Sanitary Inspector, devotes his whole time to the duties of his office. He receives assistance whenever rooms have to be disinfected. HAMPTON ISOLATION HOSPITAL. One person suffering from Scarlet Fever went to the Hampton Isolation Hospital and he paid the fee. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, TH.
