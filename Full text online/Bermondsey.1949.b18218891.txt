To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Bermondsey. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1949. In accordance with the prevailing need for economy it takes the form of a statistical summary. The changes consequent upon the National Health Service Act have now been in force eighteen months or so, but in my opinion it is still too early to make any useful comment. The outstanding need in the borough at the present time is the need for proper housing accommodation, and improvement in this direction is painfully slow. I would like once again to thank both the Council and the staff for their kindness and consideration during the past year. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, D.M.CONNAN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS. AREA. The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres. POPULATION.

DIPHTHERIA There was a somewhat distressing epidemic of Diphtheria in the first half of the year. On the 29th April an infant aged 2 years was admitted to hospital suffering from Diphtheria; she had not been immunised and she died in hospital on the 10th May. A child living in the same house attended the neighbouring school and 10 children from this school were subsequently removed to hospital, and later " contacts " of some of these children also contracted the disease. In all 51 patients were removed to hospital; 31 were found to be suffering from Diphtheria and 7 were considered to be " carriers " I regret to say that there were 5 deaths. There was some considerable local alarm and the school was closed for a few days and disinfected. As none of the children who died had been immunised, special clinics were at once arranged and several hundred children were immunised. DISINFECTION. The figures showing the work done in the disinfecting station are set out below.

The Public Health (London) Act, 1936, Section 234, requires the Borough Council to provide a proper place for the reception of dead bodies before interment. The Regional Hospital Board acts as agent for the Borough Council in this matter and receives into the mortuary at St. Olave's Hospital those bodies for which it is the duty of the Borough Council to provide. A fee of one guinea per body is paid by the Borough Council for this service. Number of infectious bodies removed Nil Total number of bodies removed 5 BURIAL OF THE DEAD It is the duty of the Borough Council under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or been found dead in the Borough in any case where no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are being made. The number of burials of such bodies arranged during the year was 13. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. SECTION 47. Section 47 provides for the removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. One such case was dealt with during the year, that of a woman aged 78, and I append a brief history of the case. The case first came to notice of the District Sanitary Inspector on the 25th May, 1948. The woman was then living at home with her husband; she was feeble, mentally weak, and in far too poor a condition to look after herself. On the 22nd December, 1948, her husband having been admitted to hospital, her son, who had a fourroom flat in the district and whose family consisted of seven adults, took her to live with him. The extra burden of looking after her caused considerable family tension, and she returned to her own home on the 8th April, 1949, to live alone, her husband having died in hospital. During all this time she had been regularly visited by the District Sanitary Inspector, who had made repeated, but unsuccessful attempts to persuade her voluntarily to enter an Old People's Home. On the 3rd May, 1949, in company with the District Sanitary Inspector, I visited her and found that her condition had deteriorated to such an extent as to warrant application to a magistrate for a Dentention Order. This was made at Tower Bridge Magistrates' Court on the 12th May, 1949, when the Magistrate made an Order for a period of three months. She was removed to Newington Lodge, Southwark, and at the time of going to press is still there and stated to be happy and comfortable. STREET AND OPEN MARKETS On the 2nd May, 1949, the open markets in Bermondsey Square and Southwark Park Road were officially opened by His Worship the Mayor of Bermondsey (Councillor H. A. Beal, J.P.), on which date the street traders removed from the streets on to the market sites provided by the Council. On the 26th May, 1949, however, the street traders of Tower Bridge Road and Bermondsey Street moved back to their original positions in the roadway, having lodged an appeal with the Secretary of State against the action of the Council. A public inquiry was held before E. Daly Lewis, Esq., Barristerat-Law, on the 22nd and 27th September, 1949, with the result that the Secretary of State decided that the parts of the streets which should be designated for the purpose of street trading under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1947, were to be — (i) Tower Bridge Road (North side from 93 Tower Bridge Road to Bermondsey Street). (ii) Bermondsey Street (Tower Bridge Road to a point 30 feet south of the junction of Bermondsey Street with Abbey Street and Long Lane). The Council, at the meeting of the 21st December, 1949, passed a designating resolution to this effect, and the licensed street traders were transferred to their new positions on the 2nd January, 1950. The effect of the ruling was that the congested portion of Tower Bridge Road, taking heavy vehicular traffic, could not be used for street trading. On 27th September, 1949, the Southwark Park Road street traders moved from the open market sites provided for them, back into the roadway, and their appeal to the Secretary of State is under consideration. Number of licences in operation during 1949 232 Income for 1949 £3,434 IIs 6d. During the year 130 summonses were taken out under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1947, against unlicensed traders—these were all " barrow boys " trading in the London Bridge area. All these prosecutions were successful and fines totalling £102 5s. od. were imposed with costs amounting to £40 10s. 6d. DRAINAGE WORK.

It was observed that in nearly every carcase lymphatic glands had been deliberately removed, and in the case of a portion of the consignment the Mutton was described in the papers as " Caseous Meat." Inquiries were made and it was learned that this meat was intended for human consumption. Under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937, any meat from which a lymphatic gland has been removed (except a gland necessarily removed in the preparation of the meat) is prohibited meat which shall not be imported for human consumption. The whole consignment was detained and I gave instructions that it was not to be allowed to go for human consumption nor allowed to be transferred to another borough without permission. The matter was reported to the Public Health Committee, and I finally received a note from the Ministry of Food to say that the Ministers of Food and Health had amended the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations so as to permit the importation of mutton and lamb from which a lymphatic gland had been removed and had drawn up a revised code to guide food inspectors in dealing with carcases which showed evidence of having been infected with caseous lymphadenitis. The amending regulations had been published and copies of them and of the memorandum containing the revised criteria of inspection were being sent to all Port Health Authorities and Port Medical Officers. I therefore gave the necessary instructions for the release of the meat. Portuguese Chinchards. —A consignment of 7,789 cases of Chinchards comprising ten different marks was landed at Chambers Wharf ex the S.S. " Omlandia." Two samples were submitted for analysis, and the Public Analyst reported that — " upon emptying the cans it would seem that small metallic particles came away with the scale of the fish skin." The metallic contamination in each sample was well below the limit. The consignment was detained and the importer notified. Some deliveries had already been made and therefore the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which they had gone was notified of the condition of the Chinchards, the name and address of the merchant, and the quantity sent to that district. Eight more samples, one from each of the remaining marks, were submitted to the Analyst, and as a result of his reports it was decided to release 3,147 cases of Chinchards. On December 7th I met the importer, who suggested that the condition was due to the tins being overpacked and the contents scorched during the processing. This contention was borne out by the reports of the Public Analyst and in no case was the metallic contamination excessive. The importer stated that the goods had already been paid for and were worth approximately £20,000, and they would probably lose this sum if the goods were destroyed. I came to the conclusion that as the metallic contamination was so low, no possible harm from metal poisoning could come to a person consuming the fish, and I therefore agreed to release these goods for sale. It was considered that although the fish might be unsaleable, it was not unfit for food. I pointed out to the importer, however, that he might experience some trouble from other Local Authorities who might not consider the goods suitable for sale. Subsequently quite a considerable proportion of these Chinchards were returned to the importer as unsaleable. French pork.—On April 7th a consignment of about 10 tons of French Pork Sides came into the Bricklayers Arms Depot addressed to the Ministry of Food. This importation appeared to be contrary to the provisions of the Importation of Carcases (Prohibition) Order, 1926 (S.R. & O. 1926, No. 574 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries), and the meat was not accompanied by any recognised Official Certificate as required by the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937/48 (Circular No. 1690, 30th March, 1938). I therefore wrote to the Ministry of Food pointing out that I naturally did not wish to take any action which would prevent sound food from coming into the country at the present time, and asking for information on the matter. In reply I was informed that an agreement had been reached between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food that the provisions for the Importation of Carcases (Prohibition) Order of 1926 should not apply to meat and meat products imported from France by the Ministry of Food. This agreement was reached after discussion between United Kingdom and French veterinary authorities during which certain safeguards were worked out against the risk of introducing foot and mouth disease. It was stated that the consignment referred to was a sample, and had originally been prepared, frozen, and stored, without any intention of exporting it to the United Kingdom and therefore no official certificates had been attached. The meat was accordingly released. UNSOUND FOOD. The general inspection of food in shops and on stalls forms part of the duty of the District Sanitary Inspectors. Food, in the quantities stated, came under the notice of the Inspectors during the year, and being found unfit for human consumption was destroyed or disposed of for animal feeding purposes.

As a result of samples being purchased, it was found that nine contraventions of the Act occurred, poisons being sold wrongly by unlisted vendors. Warnings were given in all cases. MILK PREMISES. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938. MILK AND DAIRIES ORDER, 1936. Seven milk sellers were registered under the above Acts during 1949, and 5 were removed from the Register. There were 104 milk sellers on the Register at the end of the year. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (RAW MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED) REGULATIONS, 1949.

MILK SAMPLING. Samples of milk, both for bacteriological and chemical examination, are taken from milksellers, and special arrangements are made for the sampling of the milk supplied to all schools in the borough. The total number of samples submitted for analysis during 1949 was 561, of which number 67 were taken from schools. For Chemical (i.e., Fat and non-Fatty Solids) Analysis.

General Report by the Public Analyst on the analysis of twelve samples of Breads received from the Food and Drugs Inspector during October and November, 1949. All the samples were " White " bread ; the colours and textures were satisfactory and there was little deviation from a standard product. Crude Fibre.—The greater the proportion of th: grain milled as flour, i.e., the higher the extraction, the more crude fibre is to be expected. However, the crude fibre content of these samples (presumably made from £5 per cent extraction National Flour) is low for bread made from such high extraction flour, and compares favourably with pre-war white bread. This may be due to improved methods of milling. The crude fibre in present-day wholemeal bread is about 0.73 per cent. Added Chalk.—The calcium content of National flour is fortified by the addition of chalk to the extent of 14 ounces “creta preparata” per sack of 280 pounds. The natural calcium of the flour amounts to about 0.025 per cent and fortification increases this to a total of about 0.144 per cent. For bread prepared from such flour the figures are approximately 0.015 per cent and 0.105 per cent (depending on the moisture content of the loaf). The calcium content of these samples has been calculated back to show approximately the amount of added chalk present in the flour used in making the bread. This necessitated the natural calcium content of the flour itself being assumed. From the accompanying table it can be seen that there is a variation from 11½ to 23 ounces per sack, although the majority came within a range of 12 to 16 ounces per sack which might be taken as reasonable limits of variation in view of the uncertainty of the results. It is understood that millers have some difficulty in evenly mixing the chalk in the flour and that there is a tendency afterwards for the chalk to separate out. This may account for the higher figures in the cases of samples Nos. 242, 335, 336 and 431.
