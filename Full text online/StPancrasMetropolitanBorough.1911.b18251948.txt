To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors,— I.—INTRODUCTION. I have the honour to present to you the Fifty-Sixth Annual Report upon the Vital and Sanitary Condition of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Although the Registration District of St. Pancras has remained practically the same area since 1856, except for a few adjustments of boundary described in the Report for the year 1900, the changes in the areas of the Registration Sub-Districts since the last-mentioned date have been great. Changes were made in 1900, at the census of 1901, and again in 1906, when the two southern Sub-Districts were almalgamated. So that now the four Registration Sub-Districts of St. Pancras, except for slight deviations of the outer boundary, coincide with the four Parliamentary Divisions. CENSUS. The detailed figures of the 1911 Census were not available for this Report. METEOROLOGICAL RECORDS. Here follow the Meteorological Records for the year, as deduced from observations made at Greenwich and at Camden Square. 11 METEOROLOGICAL TABLE FOR SAINT PANCRAS, 1911.

The Notification of Births Act, 1907, came into operation on 9th March, 1908. Primarily, the duty of notifying a birth to the Medical Officer of Health devolves upon the father of the child if he be resident in the house at the time of its occurrence; secondarily, upon any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth. The notice must be given by posting a prepaid letter or post card within 3G hours after the birth, or by delivery of a written notice of the birth at the office of the Medical Officer of Health within the same time. The local authority must supply, without charge, addressed and stamped post cards containing the form of notice to any medical practitioner or midwife residing or practising in their area who applies for the same. The notification is in addition to and not in substitution for the requirements of the Act relating to the registration of births, and it applies to any child born after the expiration of the 28th week of pregnancy, whether alive or dead. Liability to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings is incurred by any person who fails to give notice of a birth unless there is reasonable ground to believe that notice has been duly given by some other person. 23 ACTION TAKEN DURING THE YEAR.

During the year 1911, of 5,135 live births registered, 4554, or 88.7 per cent., were notified within 36 hours—that is to say, marly three-fourths of the livebirths were promptly notified, and, in addition, 134 still-births. The sending of cautionary letters in cases where there has been omission to notify is having the effect of bringing the notifications in earlier. The effect upon the infantile mortality has been as follows:— In 1904 = 151.6 deaths of infants per 1000 births. „ 1905 = 135.7 „ 1906 = 131.1 „ 1907 = 113.8 „ 1908 = 115.0 „ 1909 = 108.8 „ 1910 = 107.8 „ 1911 = 121.3 (1121)* THE POSITION OF ST. PANCRAS. The summers of 1907, 1908, 1909, and 1910 were cold, and the St. Pancras method of prevention was not put to the test of comparison with other boroughs and towns in the third quarter of the year. It was in this hot quarter of the year that St. Pancras did so well, by comparison, in lowering the mortality, as shown by the three years 1904, 1905, and 1906, especially in the last and hottest year of the three. When it is called to mind what a large proportion of infant mortality is caused by summer diarrhoea and other diseases due to improper feeding in the hot weather, it is apparent that the principal test of the value of a system of saving infant life by breast-feeding is the total mortality in the third, or summer quarter of the year. The prevalence of measles exerts its main effect in the second and fourth quarters, and cold in the presence of poverty, which connotes insufficient clothing and warming in the first or winter quarter of the year, and prematurity, more or less, all the vear round. The Quarterly and Annual position of merit of St. Pancras, compared to London Boroughs and the 76 large towns, for the years 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, and 1911 in regard to Infantile Mortality :— 29 London Boroughs. 1st Qr. 2nd Qr. 3rd Qr. 4th Qr.

PANCRAS PREVENTIVE SCHEME. The St. Pancras preventive scheme of infantile mortality is briefly as follows:— 1. Notification of Births.—From these are selected the most suitable cases to visit, commencing with the poorest houses in the poorest streets. 2. Advice Cards to Mothers.—A copy of the Advice Card is sent to the mother of every newly-born child as soon as the birth is notified. Supplies of these cards are also sent to medical practitioners, hospitals, dispensaries, and midwives for distribution. 3. Medical Advice. —In cases where mothers are suffering from disease they are referred to doctors, hospitals, and dispensaries, and where mothers arc in need of extra food and milk to continue breast-feeding they are referred to religious and charitable organisations, and especially the St. Pancras School for Mothers. During the year, as previously, the work of the Woman Inspector in advising expectant mothers and in correcting defective and improper feeding has been supplemented by assistance received from a number of lady voluntary visitors. The St. Pancras Mothers' and Infants' Society, supported by voluntary contributions and voluntary workers, with its SCHOOL FOR MOTHERS, supplements the municipal work, and is doing a great good in the southern part of the Borough. On the 4th September, 1909, the Local Government Board issued an Order with respect to the qualification, duties, &c., of Health Visitors under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which empowers the Borough Councils to appoint suitable women for the purpose of giving to persons advice as to the proper nurture, care and management of young children, and the promotion of cleanliness. The Act of 1908 enables the County Council to pay out of the County Fund any sum by way of contribution towards the salary of a Health Visitor appointed under the regulations not exceeding in any case one-half the amount. In 1910 the Chief Medical Officer of the Local Government Board issued a complete report upon the subject of infant and child mortality. Amongst the remedies recommended were:—A more detailed investigation of all deaths occurring in infancy as a guide to administrative acton; inquiries into the circumstances attending still-births ; the adequate training of midwives; the efficient administration of the Midwives Act ; the adoption of the Notification of Births Act; and making of arrangements for the giving of instruction on infant hygiene. Rut the foremost means of securing a low infant mortality are :—Efficient domestic and municipal sanitation and housing, and intelligent and painstaking motherhood. There is much machinery which has already been devised to meet this last-mentioned end, including paid and voluntary' women health visitors, schools for mothers, consultation centres for mothers, infant milk depots, and in some of the London Boroughs nursing and expectant 28 mothers are able to avail themselves of the opportunities provided by philanthropic bodies of obtaining meals at trivial cost. Moreover, much assistance has been given in the same direction through such legislative enactments as the Notification of Births Act and the Midwives Act. The Local Government Board had under their consideration the excessive child mortality, especially from diarrhoea and enteritis, which accompanied the very hot and dry summer of 1911. They realised that some excess of mortality over that occuring in the cool and wet summers was inevitable, and suggested the following lines along which it was most important that action should be taken:— Firstly it is important that exact advice should be given as to the feeding and management of children and more generally as to preventing the exposure of their food to contamination from decomposing organic matter. The distribution of clearly worded leaflets is useful in this connection : but even more important are personal visits and the offer of practical advice to the mother of babies born within the last twelve months. Exact and simple instructions are most likely to be followed if given during a period of special danger. In districts and towns in which the Notification of Births Act has been adopted, the records obtained under that Act will give valuable information in selecting the homes to which visits are now most urgently required. Secondly, the full value of the personal instructions indicated above cannot be realised unless vigorous efforts are made to prevent the accumulation in or in the vicinity of the house of decomposing animal or vegetable matter. It is not necessary to do more than mention the importance of efficient scavenging of frequent and if practicable daily removal of house and stable refuse, of domestic cleanliness, and of keeping all food properly protected. The Council may consider it advisable during the next few weeks to divert the sanitary inspectors from less urgent work, and to instruct them to make rapid visits with a view to securing efficient sanitation, especially in and about the houses of the working classes. Thirdly, it is important that the Council should promptly ascertain in which parts of their district diarrhoea is especially prevalent, and should devote close attention to street and court scavenging and to the removal of stable and domestic refuse in these areas. Without waiting for the weekly death returns, efforts should be made to obtain information of cases of diarrhoea from health visitors and others who make domestic visits, and to impress upon parents the importance of immediate treatment of infantile diarrhoea. Apart from the medical notification of cases of epidemicidiarrhoea in children, the vistis of health visitors can be utilised for impressing upon parents the seriousness of diarrhoea amongst young children and the desirability of information being given to the Medical Officer of Health should a case of diarrhoea occur. During the year a North St. Pancras School for Mothers was started by a Committee of Ladies and Gentlemen, who obtained the use of a large room at 4, Rhyl Street, Maiden Road, Kentish Town. This new School is doing excellent work and increasing rapidly. 29 BRIEF HISTORY OF SCHOOLS FOR MOTHERS. The steady fall in the birth-rate of civilised countries, and especially of France, first drew attention to the importance of making efforts to diminish the infantile mortality. These commenced also in France and were initiated by obstetric physicians in connection with maternity hospitals—the best organised institutions being the "Consultations de Nourrissons," which started at the Maternity Hospital at Nancy in 1890, followed by the late Professor Budin in the Paris Hospitals, commencing at La Charite in 1892, and these and other similar institutions dealt at first with mothers who had been patients in the Hospitals. In 1892 also Dr. Yariot established in Paris a " Gouttes de Lait " in connection with a Dispensary where mothers not attending hospitals could bring their infants for advice, and where sick infants were treated and supplied with milk of proper quality and quantity for hand-feeding. Faulty hand-feeding being regarded as the main cause of infantile mortality, especially in summer time, the idea of supplying a better artificial food for sucklings was eagerly assumed to be a speedy and direct method of checking the death-rate of infants. Accordingly, Infants' Milk Depots (Gouttes de Lait) were started in Great Britain in various places between 1899 and 1904. These institutions diminished the mortality of the hand-fed infants to whom their prepared milk was distributed, but had little or no effect upon infantile mortality generally, until infant consultations and home visiting were adopted by them with a view to diminishing the amount of hand-feeding which their first efforts tended to increase by the subsidisation of this mode of feeding. To quote Dr. J. J. Buchan, M.O.H. of St. Helens, where the first Milk Depot in Great Britain was established:—" The sphere of such a depot is strictly limited ; it must be used as part of a general plan, the success of which will be greatly to diminish the number of infants to be supplied with depot milk. At St. Helens during the ten years the depot has been in use, the number of hand-fed infants has fallen from 20 to 5 per cent. of the total births. There are at present in the Borough only 150 infants being hand-fed, about half of them are nourished on depot milk. Infant milk depots, like fever hospitals, must work for their own extinction." In his Annual Report for 1910 Dr. Buchan says: " the percentage of infants who are breast-fed has increased, and on the present method of reckoning amounted to 98 in 1910. An inquiry into 2,170 cases showed that only 6.6 per cent, of the infants originally reckoned as breast-fed at birth were weaned before they were six months old." When the Infant Milk Depots were coming upon the scene careful enquiries were made in St. Pancras into the effect of the usual leaflets distributed by Medical Officers of Health in which breast-feeding was briefly referred to as desirable, and lengthy details were given of the preparation of food for handfeeding, and it was found that mothers were weaning their babies prematurely in order to carry out the detailed instructions of the Medical Officer of Health as to hand-feeding. We promptly destroyed our leaflets and set to work to analyse anew the causes of infant mortality during the previous half century and these were the conclusions arrived at:— 30 (1) That improved sanitation [i.e., hygiene of place) had brought down the death-rate of persons over one year of age, but had failed to bring down the death-rate of infants under one. (2) That deteriorating maternal hygiene (i.e., hygiene of person) had counteracted the effect of improving sanitation (i.e., hygiene of place) upon the death-rate of infants under one. (3) That the infantile mortality had increased in the earlier days, weeks and months of life, and diminished in the later period of the first year. (4) That the increased earlier mortality of infants was caused—firstly by immaturity, due to pre-natal conditions, especially the health of the mother during expectancy; secondly by post-natal conditions, especially the faulty feeding of the infant by the mother, and in a lesser degree the deficiency of clothing and warmth provided by the parents for the child. (5) That the greatest mortality of infants was from diseases of the alimentary system during the summer months, a lesser mortality frc.m respiratory diseases during the winter months, and a marked mortality from immaturity or want of vitality all the year round. (6) That enquiries everywhere into the deaths of infants showed that the mortality of the hand-fed was 10, 29, 30 or more fold than that of the breast-fed. Therefore, it was concluded that the main remedies required were briefly— (a) The improvement of the health of the expectant mother; (b) The maintenance of the health of the suckling mother ; (c) The avoidance of premature weaning of the infant from the breast, especially during the summer months; and (d) the protection of the infant from cold, especially during the winter months. In 1904 in St. Pancras we commenced, through our Health Visitors, to base our action upon these indications. In the new leaflet we issued we purposely omitted any instructions as to hand feeding, and referred all mothers to medical practitioners in order to prevent them from failing in health, and prematurely weaning their infants from the breast, and, in any case, to submit themselves and their infants to periodical medical consultation and advice. In the summer of 1905 a Conference of London Representatives was held in St. Pancras Town Hall. A brief account of this Conference was given in a paper "On teaching the hygiene of the expectant and suckling mother" by the Medical Officer of Health, and published in the Proceedings of the National Conference on Infantile Mortality held at Caxton Hall in the summer of 1906. We preached breast-feeding in season and out of season until we were regarded as unreasonable, but the infant mortality during the warm summer of 1906, when compared with that of 1901 and 1905, fully justified our persistent attitude. During that warm dry summer quarter of 1906 the infantile mortality of England and Wales rose 21 per thousand, that of the 76 great towns, 31 23 per thousand, and that of the 142 smaller towns 31 per thousand, and that of London 16 per thousand, whereas that of St. Pancras fell 3 per thousand. Similarly, in the hot dry summer quarter of 1911 just concluded, the infantile mortality of St. Pancras was 11 per cent. below that of London, although in ordinary times the mortality of St. Pancras is usually the same as that of London, i.e., an average of ail London. Again proving the value of the breastfeeding campaign at a period when many other Metropolitan Boroughs had also adopted the same course. In November, 1904, the first "Restaurant de Meres-Nourrices" was opened by Henry Coullet in a little shop in the Passage Julien Lacroix at Belleville in Paris, but this new departure did not become known in Great Britain until -Miss Evelyn Bunting's letter appeared in the Times of the 29th December, 1905, and in 1906 dinners for Nursing Mothers were started in Fulham by Mrs. Gordon. About this time Dr. Miele was adding to his Dispensary for Nursing Mothers in Ghent the teaching of puericulture or infant care, with which educational method the Hon. Mrs. Bertramd Russell was so favourably impressed upon her visit there. Ultimately, in June, 1907, the St. Pancras School for Mothers was opened, and organised by a combination of these various activities centred round the mother. British and Foreign Institutions differ in one important particular—British Institutions do not treat sick mothers and children but refer them to their own medical attendants. Is is the maintenance of the health, and the improvement of the domestic education of mothers and their children that is the aim of the British Schools for Mothers. It has been found that the organisation of a complete school should be such us to provide:— (a) Periodical medical consultations (weighing and hygienic advice) for both nursing and non-nursing mothers and their infants. (b) Cheap nourishing dinners daily for mothers suckling their infants. (c) Periodical instruction and demonstration in the arts of mothercraft at the school and at home. (d) Association with the Day Nursery and Nursery School, which should be so conducted as to provide:— (i) Daily scrutiny of each child by the matron, supplemented by medical opinion, when necessary, to protect the institution from infectious diseases and contagious disorders. (ii) Periodical medical inspection and hygienic advice for the prevention of physical defects. (iii) Training the functions, habits, senses and reasoning powers of children according to age, and familiarising the mothers in the methods adopted for training. (iv) Visits to the homes to improve the home hygiene and surroundings. (v) Regulations as to the admission of infants under six months of age so as to avoid giving encouragement to premature weaning. 32 The most recent move is the amalgamation of Consultations and Schools for Mothers, keeping in view further extension so as to embrace Day Nurseries and Nursery Schools. The object is to formulate the teaching and practice of mothcrcraft from expectancy to school age, so as to prevent not only infant mortality, but also the defects of school children. The amalgamation of the two societies of "Infant Consultations" and "Schools for Mothers" into one Association under the auspices and as a Department of the National League of Physical Education was approved and agreed to in May, 1911, upon the following basis: — (1) That curative medical treatment, as apart from advice on the ordinary care, feeding, &c , of mothers and infants does not come within the scope either of the Consultations or of the Schools. (2) That Infant Consultations should form the basis of every School for Mothers, and should be aimed at as the basis of all Infant Visiting and similar Associations. (3) That all Consultations should be conducted by properly qualified medical practitioners. (4) That no cases should be brought to the Consultations if they are already being attended by their own medical attendant, except by desire of the latter. (5) That the indiscriminate distribution of printed matter giving instructions for artificial feeding is not to be recommended, and that this form of advice should be given in each individual case by the medical officer at the consultation. (6) That all cases should be investigated to ascertain their suitability from the social and economic point of view, before admission to the services of either institution. These should be regarded as the golden rules for guidance in the organisation and administration of Schools for Mothers. REPORT OF THE WOMAN INSPECTOR AND HEALTH VISITOR. To the Medical Officer of Health, Sir, I submit a report of the work done for the Prevention of Infant Mortality in the Borough of St. Pancras during the year 1911. The work has been carried out on the same lines as in previous years. 1 have been ably assisted from time to time in both the clerical and visiting work by fully qualified women voluntary visitors. Several hours each morning are spent in clerical work. Advice cards are sent daily on receipt of each Notification, which is then copied on to its District Sheet. The lists of Notifications are compared weekly with the Registrars' Returns, and those parents who have failed to notify are sent Cautionary Letters reminding them of their duty under the Notification of Births Act. Complete indices are also kept of all registered Births and Deaths of infants under one year. I have endeavoured where possible to come into touch with all the philanthropic and charitable agencies at work in St. Pancras. These have been most helpful in dealing with difficult and necessitous cases. 33 In July of this year the North St. Pancras School for Mothers was opened at 4, Rhyl Street—the premises having been kindly lent one afternoon a week for this purpose. This new School has been of the greatest assistance in dealing with the infant work in the northern part of the Borough, and a large number of mothers have taken advantage of the educational facilities afforded by the School. The Summer of 1911 was an abnormally hot one, and the infant death-rate all over the country was much above the average. A special inquiry was made in St. Pancras at the homes of all infants under one year who died of Diarrhœal diseases during July, August and September. The following information obtained through this enquiry may be of interest:— Cases investigated 135 Some information obtained 129 Family moved. No information 3 6 Information refused 1 Never lived in St. Pancras 2 Feeding at time of death illness. Breast-fed 11 129 Mixed-fed 22 Hand-fed 96 Of the 118 wholly or partially artificially fed at death:— 118 44 had never been breast-fed. 12 had been breast-fed up to 1 week. 30 „ ,, from 2-3 weeks. 7 ,, ,, to 1 month. 14 ,, ,, from 1-2 month 3 „ „ 2-3 „ 1 „ „ „ 3-4 „ 1 „ „ „ 4-5 „ 3 „ „ „ 5-6 „ 1 „ „ „ 6-7 „ 2 „ „ „ 8-9 „ Of these only 5 confessed to using tube bottles. 16 were illegitimate. 6 were twins. The subjoined Table A may also be of interest as showing the particular month of age at death, and the method of feeding at that time. The compulsory notification of Ophthalmia Neonatorum came into force from March 13th, 1911. Since that date twenty-six notifications of this disease have been received in St. Pancras. Of these, five were workhouse cases. Twenty-one were being nursed at home at the date of the first inquiry. Of these, four were afterwards removed to Hospital or Infirmary. Of the remaining seventeen, eleven mothers were taught how to carry out the Doctors instructions themselves. In four cases Queen's Nurses were called in, and in the remaining two the maternity nurse who had attended at the confinement was responsible. 34 I have in every case made the inquiry myself on the day of receipt of the notification, and have afterwards kept the cases under observation. I paid 42 revisits to these houses to urge cleanliness and carc in following the Doctors directions and to arrange for disinfection of the clothing and bedding after the infant's recovery. The District Nursing Associations working in the Borough have been most kind in co-op crating with the Public Health Department in this matter, and have agreed to attend any cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum on receiving written request from me to do so, provided that the patient is being medically attended. The following Institutions have expressed their willingness to co-operate with us in this way :— the Queen s Nurses, 26, Heathhurst Road. „ ,, 143, Camden Street. ,, „ 35, South Villas, Highgate. The Metropolitan and Nursing Association for providing trained Nurses for the sick poor. 23, Bloomsbury Square. the North London Association for nursing the sick poor 413, Holloway Road. These Associations cover every district in St. Pancras, so that there is no part of the Borough in which it is impossible to obtain skilled attendance should occasion require. It will be seen from the accompanying table of feeding in these 21 cases (Table C.) that the greater number of the notifications were received between the first and second week of the infant's life. It may therefore be of interest to know the proportion of Doctors, Midwives, or Professional Assistants attending: at the confinement. This is set out in the table below:— Doctor's Cases 7 21 Midwives Cases 10 Professional Assistants Cases 1 Confinements in Hospital 3 The need for the greater instruction of the untrained nurse and relations who look after both mother and infant in the intervals between the visits of the Doctor or Midwife, is very apparent in many of these cases. The London County Council has provided instruction for these nurses in special classes during the winter months ; and I have sent names of women who have been nursing Ophthalmia Neonatorum cases to the nurse in charge of one of these classes, ill order that they may receive special instruction on the care of the eyes of newborn infants. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Celia Smith, Sanitary Inspector. TABLE A.

In inquiring into any infectious disease it is ascertained whether there are any other persons in the house unwell, and, if so, they are advised to seek medical advice forthwith. In cases of consumption the health-visitor or nurse searches out contacts, suspects, and susceptible persons and sends them to be medically examined as to their condition and to have their symptoms or disease diagnosed. A systematic search is now made amongst school children for any defects or diseases present, and the search beiug conducted by medical practitioners the examination and diagnosis are made at the same time. Bacteriological Tests.—When cases of suspected infectious diseases occur there is sometimes considerable difficulty and delay in making an exact medical diagnosis in certain types of the diseases. Here bacteriological and additional clinical examinations are brought to bear upon doubtful types, and to check or confirm the diagnosis. The number of specimens of secretion, blood and sputum submitted to bacteriological tests during the year in suspected cases of Diphtheria, Typhoid, or Enteric Fever, and Tuberculosis, and the results of examination, were as follows:— Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Diphtheria (Secretion) 53 .. 99 152 Reaction obtained. Doubtful. Reaction not obtained. Total. Typhoid (Blood) 14 .. 26 40 Bacillus found. Doubtful. Bacillus not found. Total. Tuberculosis (Sputum) 19 .. 74 93 39 Swabs of the secretion of the throat or nose are taken in three sets of circumstances for bacteriological examination— 1. In order to verify the diagnosis of diphtheria at the earliest moment. 2. In order to ascertain that a patient is free from diphtheria bacilli before release from isolation. 3. In order to obtain information whether apparently healthy contacts are harbouring diphtheria bacilli in the throat or nose Infectious diseases fall into several categories— (a) Compulsorily certifiable diseases. (b) Temporary certifiable diseases, e.g., chicken-pox when small-pox is present. (c) Non-certifiable diseases — (i.) Communicable Diseases notifiable by School Teachers, e.g., measles, whooping-cough, mumps, tonsilitis. (ii.) Communicable Disorders notifiable by School Teachers, e.g., ophthalmia (blight), ringworm, impetigo, scabies, pediculosis. (iii.) Suspicious Symptoms, e.g., sore throat, feverish cold, whooping, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, &c. 40 § 2.—NOTIFICATION AND DISEASES.

This matter was considered by the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health in 1906, and it was decided that it was undesirable to take any steps to remove erysipelas from the list of notifiable diseases. 45 SMALL-POX. In the early part of the year an outbreak of Small-pox occurred. The first known case in the outbreak was that of a young girl who became an inmate of the Mile End Infirmary on the 5th February, and was removed, with six other patients, to the Metropolitan Asylum Board's Small-pox Hospital on the '21st February, 1911. For a little over seven months previous to the latter date no case of Small-pox had occurred in London. Of the seven cases referred to above five were inpatients at that Infirmary, one was a scrubber employed there, and the seventh was a sister of the first case and living in Mile End. On the 22nd February four, and on the 23rd fourteen, patients were removed from the Infirmary or from houses in contiguous districts, and from that date onward until the middle of May cases continued to arise from day to day. In all 70 cases were received, 33 from the district of Mile End (28 of these from the Infirmary where the first cases arose), 24 from eight other districts of London, and 13 from beyond the Metropolitan area. No cases occurred in St. Pancras. A11 outline of the organisation ready to meet Small-pox was given in last year's Annual Report. CHICKEN-POX. On account of the outbreak of Small-pox in the Borough of Stepney in February, the London County Council resolved, on March 14th, 1911, to make an Order requiring the notification of Chicken-pox to be compulsory for a period of three months, dating from the 22nd March, 1911.

An outbreak of Diphtheria occurred in the Infants' Department of the Princess Road School, of which the following is a brief summary:— Between the middle of May and the end of July, before the summer holidays, there were, in the Infants' Department of the Princess Road School, 13 cases of Diphtheria, of which 6 were fatal; of these, 13 cases, 10 occurred in classroom F, 1 in B, 1 in G, 1 in D, and none in the other three classrooms. The summer holidays commenced on the 26th July and terminated on the 28th August. No cases occurred in that district during the holidays amongst any of the children attending the school. For the first fortnight on the reassembly of the schools there were no cases of diphtheria in any part of the schools, boys, girls, or infants. Between the 1lth September and the 8th December, there were 18 cases, of which 3 were fatal; of the 18 eases, 7 occurred in classroom B, 4 in D, 2 in C, 2 in Hall, 2 in F, and 1 in G, and none in E. The London County Council Education Department asked that the classrooms, etc., might be sprayed and fumigated, and it was pointed out that what was wanted was closure of the school and thorough cleansing of all surfaces, furniture and fittings. The school was closed on Friday, December 8th, the London County Council admitted the disinfectors and the rooms were sprayed and disinfected on the 8th and 9th December, when the department was found to be in a filthy condition. The Infants' Department was closed until after the Christmas holidays, and the London County Council Education Department thoroughly cleansed the school. ACUTE POLIO-MYELITIS AND CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. Cerebro-spinal Fever (Epidemic Cerebro-spinal Meningitis) was first made a notifiable disease in London in 1907, and the Order came into effect on the 12th March of that year, and the Order has been renewed from year to year since. The term cerebro-spinal fever includes posterior basal meningitis, but not meningitis due to tuberculosis, syphilis, middle-ear disease, or injury. The services of Dr. Wanklyn, Assistant Medical Officer of Health, Public Health Department, London County Council, 8, St. Martin's Place, W.C., are available for the investigation of cases in association with medical practitioners, should they so desire. A circular letter of the Local Government Board, dated 12th December, 1911, advised the permanent notification of Acute Polio-Myelitis or Acute PolioEncephalitis and of Cerebro-spinal Fever or Epidemic Cerebro-spinal Meningitis. Accordingly the London County Council made an Order requiring, from and including 13th March, 1912, the notification, in the Administrative County of London, of these two diseases. The dangers of these diseases are, that they are believed to be communicable, that their onset is insidious, that they mainly attack young children, and are often the cause of infantile paralysis. 47 OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. " Ophthalmia Neonatorum" means literally " inflammatory eye-disease of the new-born." The disease usually commences when (I.) Doctor, (II.) Midwife, or (III.) Professional Assistant is in attendance on the mother, and therefore one of these who is in attendance must be the first to observe any inflammation of the eyes. (I.) Duly of Medical Practitioners. It is the duty of a medical attendant to forthwith certify to the Medical Officer of Health any case of Ophthalmia Neonatorum as soon as he becomes aware of it in accordance with Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (II.) Duties of Midwives in regard to Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Rulks Framed by the Central Midwives' Board under Section 3 (1) of the Midwives Act, 1902 (2 Edw. 7, c. 17). * * * * E. Regulating, supervising, and restricting within due limits the practice of midwives. * * * * 14. As soon as the child's head is born, and if possible before the eyes are opened, its eyelids should be carefully cleanted. * * * * 18. In all cases of abortion, of illness of the patient or child, or of any abnormality occurring during pregnancy, labour, or lying-in, a midwife must explain that the case is one in which the attendance of a registered medical practitioner is required, and must hand to the husband or nearest relative or friend present the form of sending for medical help [see Rule 21 (a) ], properly filled up and signed by her, in order that this may be immediately forwarded to the medical practitioner. If for any reason the services of a registered medical practitioner be not available, a midwife must, if the case be one of emergency, remain with the patient and do her best for her until the registered medical practitioner arrives, or until the emergency is over. After having complied with the Rule as to the summoning of medical assistance, the midwife will not incur any legal liability by remaining on duty and doing her best for her patient. * * * * 19. The foregoing rule shall apply :— * * * * (5) In the case of the child, when there is any abnormality or complication, such as— * * * * 48 Inflammation of the eyes, however slight. * * * * 20. (1) The midwife must send notice to the Local Supervising Authority, in accordance with Rule 21, in the following cases— (a) Medical help.—Whenever she has advised under Rule 18 that a registered medical practitioner should be sent for. # * * * 21. For the purpose of the preceding rules the use of the following forms shall be compulsory: — (a) Form of sending for Medical Help. No. Date This notice is on behalf of (here fill in name of patient) Address I have advised that medical assistance be obtained on account of (inflammation of the eyes). Signed Certified Midwife. The case is/is not urgent. Sent to (name of Doctor) at (address) Time of sending message The midwife shall make two copies of the above, making with the original documents three forms in all. The original she shall keep, the second she shall hand to the patient's representative in accordance with Rule 18, and the third she shall send to the Local Supervising Authority as soon as possible, but within 24 hours at the latest. * * * * The London County Council has appointed two lady doctors to act as Medical Inspectors of Midwives. As soon as a Medical Inspector receives a notice from a midwife that a child has inflammation of the eyes, she visits the case and, if satisfied, after examination, she certifies it as Ophthalmia Neonatorum. (III.) Duties of Professional Assistants in regard to Ophthalmia Neonatorum. The presumption is that the pupils of midwives are instructed to examine and cleanse the eyes of newly born infants and to report. It woidd be desirable for all hospitals to adopt the rules made to guide midwives in cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum as far as they would be applicable to extern obstetric attendants. The vigilance then exercised would probably be as omplete as human ingenuity can devise. 49 CONSUMPTION (PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS). Deaths from Consumption.

The compulsory notification of Tuberculosis has proceeded by stages to its completion. On the 1st January, 1909, the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations came into operation. They require cases of pulmonary tuberculosis coming under the notice of the following Poor La.v Officers in the discharge of their respective duties to be notified within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health:— 1.—Medical Officers of Poor Law Institutions to notify cases occurring in their Institutions to Medical Officers of Health of the district in which the sufferer resided previous to admission to the Institution. (Notification Form A.) 2.—District Medical Officers to report cases occurring among persons visited by them under their agreement with the Guardians. (Notification Form B.) 3.—Superintendent Officers of Poor Law Institutions to notify intended places of residence of persons leaving the Institution who have been certified by the Medical Officer thereof to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. (Notification Form C.) 4.—Relieving Officers to notify changes of residence of persons who have been reported by District Medical Officers to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. (Notification Form D.) On March 22nd, 1911, the Local Government Board issued the Public Health (Tuberculosis in Hospitals) Regulations, 191.1, which came into operation on May 1st. Under these Regulations notifications are received of all phthisical patients attending hospitals, dispensaries, or similar institutions. Finally, we have at the end of 1911 an order of the Local Government Board called " The Public Health (Tuberculosis Regulations), 1911," under which all other cases of pulmonary phthisis must be notified. This order came into force on the 1st January, 1912, and the Board advised that the arrangements which were necessary to facilitate the execution of the order should be made as soon as possible. These latter Regulations complete the system of compulsory notification which was inaugurated in 1908, and relate to cases in Poor Law practice, afterwards supplemented by the Public Health (Tuberculosis in Hospitals) Regulations, 1911. They make it the duty of every Medical Practitioner, with certain exceptions, to notify every case of pulmonary tuberculosis, either in his public or private practice. For each case notified the medical man is entitled to a fee of 2s. 6d. In the circular letter which accompanied the last series of Regulations, the Local Government Board observe that pulmonary tuberculosis is now generally recognised as a communicable disease. It has, however, certain special characteristics which raise new administrative problems, and some of the measures which were appropriate to diseases notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are hardly applicable to pulmonary tuberculosis. 53 The primary object in requiring notification is to enable the local authority to assist in the eradication of the disease. It is worthy of note that the death-rate from pulmonary tuberculosis, though still far higher than that resulting from any other disease to which the principle of notification has hitherto been applied, has, nevertheless, shown a marked decline in the last thirty years. In 1881 the death-rate per 10,000 of the population was 18.25, in 1891 it was 15.99, in 1901 it was 12.64, and in 1909 it was 10.93. This decrease has coincided with a marked increase in the activities of local authorities, including greatly improved sanitary administration and the treatment of the sick under more satisfactory conditions. It is impossible to estimate precisely the influence of these causes on the diminution of the death-rate, but there can be no doubt that they have been powerful factors in bringing about the reduction. With regard to the statutory powers of the Council, the Board point out that in certain cases it is no doubt desirable that the local authority should be able to offer sanatorium treatment, and for this the powers of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are available. Under these powers local authorities may either themselves provide sanatoria or may contract for the use of such institutions. The Board have been advised that these powers also enable a local authority to provide or contract for the use of dispensaries or out-patient hospitals. Treatment in an institution is not, however, always necessary or desirable, and there are many cases which, under suitable instruction and supervision, may properly be treated in the patients' own homes. Accordingly the Board have, by the Order, given a general power to the local authority, on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health, to supply such medical assistance, facilities and articles as may be necessary for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis, for preventing the spread of' infection and for removing conditionsfavourable to infection. The local authority are also empowered to appoint any necessary additional officers. Tn considering in what ways they can best aid in the control, treatment, and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis, the Board suggest that local authorities should carefully take account of existing agencies. Apart from the actual treatment of cases, the Board urge on local authorities the great importance of their making full use of their powers of preventing overcrowding, and of securing the removal of any conditions tending to injure the health of persons residing in their districts. As to the position of persons notified, the term "notification" has been associated in many minds with certain disabilities and discomforts which would involve no hardship to an adult suffering from an attack of an acute infectious disease, such as typhoid fever, but which would be intolerable, in many instances, to phthisical patients. Tuberculosis of the lung is usually a chronic disease which may permit the patient during many months, or even years, to pursue his ordinary work. The ability to convey infection is limited and intermittent, and infection can be prevented by the patient himself, when he has learnt, and 54 is not too ill to practise, elementary precautions. In these two respects the disease is essentially different from the infectious diseases which are made notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. This difference is affirmed by Article XIII of the new Regulations, and is the basis of the administrative policy of the Board in relation to pulmonary tuberculosis, and the reason for the issue of a special code of Regulations under Section 130 of the Act of 1875. The fact that the patient may be trained and may as a result cease to be a source of infection, in which case he need be subjected to no disability, should be made clear both to the patient in the interests ot society and to society in the interests of the patient. It is for this reason that education must occupy an important place in the campaign against this disease. It is, of course, unnecessary and undesirable that notification should involve publicity. The Board have no doubt that local authorities and their officers will avoid doing anything which could cause pain or annoyance to patients or their friends. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that any records which may be kept by a Medical Officer of Health in relation to persons notified should be regarded as strictly confidential documents, for whose custody the Medical Officer of Health is personally responsible. The register to be kept by a Medical Officer of Health under the new Regulations is to be open to inspection only by a person duly authorised by resolution of the Council, by t he Medical Officer of Health for the County, by any School Medical Inspector acting within the area of the Sanitary Authority, and by Officers of the Local Government Board and of the Board of Education. Article XIII. referred to above reads as follows : — "Nothing in these Regulations shall have effect so as to apply, or so as to authorise or require a Medical Officer of Health or a Council, or any other person or authority, directly or indirectly, to put in force with respect to any patient in relation to whom a notification in pursuance of these Regulations has been transmitted to a Medical Officer of Health, any enactment which renders the patient, or a person in charge of the patient, or any other person, liable to a penalty, or subjects the patient to any restriction, prohibition, or disability affecting himself or his employment, occupation, or means of livelihood, on the ground of his suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis." The St. Pancras scheme for the control, treatment, and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis works out thus :— 1. -All cases diagnosed are medically certified to the Medical Officer of Health. 2.—To all cases certified a card of advice is sent. 3.—Any person can apply to the Officers of the Public Health Department for advice and as to the available means of assistance. 4.—At the end of every quarter the residences of all patients, both private and public, are verified. 5.—The families of cases certified by Poor Law Medical Officers and Officers of Hospitals and Public Dispensaries are visited for the purpose of inquiry and advice by the Woman Inspector or her assistants. 55 6.—Contacts, suspects, and susceptibles are given introduction cards to the St. Pancras Dispensary for the purpose of medical examination, diagnosis, and report. 7.—The treatment of patients is referred in suitable cases to (a) Medical Practitioners, (b) Provident Dispensaries, Clubs, etc., (c) Hospitals and Public Dispensaries, (d) Poor Law Authorities, and (?) to various philanthropic agencies. The scheme for the voluntary notification of consumption in St. Pancras commenced at the beginning of 1906. Daring the year 1911 only 59 voluntary medical certificates were received, as compared with 192 in the preceding year. The voluntary system is now superseded by the Regulations of 1911 before mentioned, which came into force 1st January, 1912. Under the Poor Law Regulations during 1911, of a total number of 861 cases notified, 237 were received from the Workhouse, 98 from the South Infirmary, 363 from the North Infirmary, 137 from District Medical Officers, and 26 from extra parochial institutions. The St. Pancras Guardians have provided at the North Infirmary six wards specially for consumption, four of the wards containing 33, 33, 33, and 16 bods respectively for men, and two wards containing 33 and 16 beds respectively for women. There are also in addition 12 beds for men and 6 beds for women in other parts of the building, making a total of 182 beds. Under the Hospitals Regulations, 1911, the duty is imposed upon the Medical Officer who is in medical attendance upon a patient at a hospital to send a notification to the Medical Officer of Health for the area in which the hospital is situate, and the Medical Officer of Health who receives a notification relating to a patient whose residence is not within his area must transmit the notification to the Medical Officer of Health for the area where the patient resides and at the same time inform the medical officer of the hospital that he has done so. These regulations came into force on the 1st May, 1911, and up to the 31st December certificates to the number of 1192 were received. Of these 1,192 cases, 266 referred to patients residing in St. Pancras, 618 to patients residing in other Metropolitan Boroughs, and 308 to patients residing in districts outside the Metropolitan area. The work of receiving, recording, and distributing these notifications imposes a heavy additional duty upon the clerical staff of the Public Health Department. The number of deaths in St. Pancras from the pulmonary form of tuberculosis during the year was 330, as compared with 297, 374, and 362 during the three preceding years respectively. At the Conference of Metropolitan Cities and Boroughs on matters relating to Public Health, held at Spring Gardens on the 6th April, 1911, the following resolutions were passed on the subject of pulmonary tuberculosis: — (a) That the principle of compulsory notification should be extended to all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. (b) That the establishment of tuberculosis dispensaries throughout London is urgently required. 56 WOMAN INSPECTOR'S REPORT UPON CONSUMPTION. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, TUBERCULOSIS. I submit a Report upon the work done in St. Pancras during the year 1911, in connection with the notification of Consumption. During that year the system of Notification was extended, by the order of the Local Government Board, making Notification compulsory in the case of Hospital and Dispensary patients. The number of cases increased considerably, in consequence, during the past year, and the result of increasing the number of cases to which some attention has been paid, has been that less attention has been given to each individual case. The thoroughness of the investigation has naturally suffered. I have endeavoured to secure that the interests of the patients have not suffered by using as fully as possible the valuable help of local voluntary visitors in suitable cases, but investigation is necessarily a matter for officials and their place, in certain directions, cannot be filled by outside agencies. The visitors of the Public Welfare Association dealt with 175 families, and I estimate that about one thousand visits must have been paid by these visitors during the year in this work. This is a valuable addition to the educational resources of the Department, and we are deeply grateful for the assistance which has been given to our cases in this way. These visitors are valuable, not only in educating the actual patients, but also as spreading information among the general public, and in helping to form a sane public opinion which shall tend neither to panic nor to carelessness with regard to health matters. The general co-operation with the Social forces of the Borough has continued happily. The Organizers of London County Council Care Committees and of the Labour Exchange Juvenile Department, Miss Nussey and Miss Phenix, are among our new and much valued allies. The St. Pancras Dispensary, although hampered by changes during the year, has continued to give most useful help in examining and reporting upon cases referred, and in advising our helpers wherever necessary. We are also indebted to Officers of the Mount Vernon Hospital, and of the General Hospitals of the Borough for kind co-operation in various directions. There has been no alteration in the general plan of our work, and it seems only necessary to offer some general observations on points which emerge on examining about one thousand of our enquiry forms. As to the controversy which has at times raged during the year as to the part played by heredity and by infection in the causation of consumption we can only, on the evidence of our enquiry forms, take up a middle position. It has not been possible to check and sift our evidence with care sufficient to justify us in putting forward statistics. We have cases in which we can get no history of previous cases in the same family, but in which we have some evidence of infection; we have other cases in which the family history is apparently the dominating factor; and we have still other cases in which cancer, insanity, heart disease, nervous affection, and deformity appear in the 57 same family us our consumptive patient. The number of cases in which we have either 110 evidence or evidence of a kind which is reasonably open to doubt is, however, so large as to vitiate any conclusions which might be drawn from smaller groups. We have instances in which debility following measles, or other infectious disease, seems to be a predisposing case of the later illness, others in which early neglect, and still others in which constitutional weakness seem to play the main part. At this moment it may be useful to note th it we cannot solve our problem simply by providing medical treatment for consumptive patients. Patients return from Institutions, where they are perfectly comfortable, in order to meet some domestic emergency, either of sickness or want of money; others refuse to accept Institutional treatment because they are unable to leave their dependents alone at home. Men who are still able to work cannot absent themselves from duty at hours when doctors are accessible, and mothers of young children cannot leave home for the time necessary to attend a Hospital. An increase in the price of food neutralizes some of the advantages of the supply of medicine, and the best advice 011 graduated labour is useless to the person who must work or starve, and who cannot obtain work of an entirely suitable nature. I am inclined to think that one modification of the present practice might be made with advantage, and that when parents refuse to enter an Institution we might in occasional cases offer them the alternative help of temporary provision for their children away from the danger of infection. The recent Circular of the Local Government Board suggests special attention to the needs of children. We still need some provision to break the sudden change from the sea and Country Convalescent Home to the ordinarySchool. An open air School is much needed, and, even preparatory to that, our old project of a Day Convalescent Home. For delicate children who suffer so much from the strain and excitement of the ordinary School, one would like to see Froebel—or perhaps Montessori—methods in use to a much later age. I have very little doubt that the strain of constant attendance at School from too early an age, the recurring diseases which weaken School life, and the excitement and anxiety of the children as to attendance and punctuality are responsible for much of the ill-health of many of the children notified. The Hon. Secretary of the Southern St. Pancras I. C. A. A. tells me that during the year her Association dealt with 74 consumptives and pre-consumptiye children; of these 18 were under five, and 56 between five and 14. It is not probable that the number in the Northern half of the Borough would be less, so that we probably need, as an initial step, to consider the needs of from a hundred to a hundred and fifty children. A recently initiated movement to provide for the proper care of the permanently or temporarily motherless children should be of great use, and we hope to give every assistance in our power to the project. The semi-parented child is always likely to suffer in health, and any provision we can make for its welfare is of importance. The Shelter movement has not, so far, succe ded. For the two or three cases who might use them 110 shelters are available, and no one so far has been 58 found willing to use a shelter in the Southern half of the Borough where they are to be obtained. There are less strenuous objections to disinfection than formerly, though, in spite of our instruction, ideas are still a little vague as to its purpose. One woman refused a second disinfection of her room because she had felt no benefit from the first; while another woman begged for the process because she felt sure it would do her good. It may stimulate the care of the consumptive if we realise to how large an extent the uncared-for consumptive tends to drift to the food trades. A girl, who was refused Sanatorium treatment, promptly went and obtained work in a restaurant kitchen ; a man, whom no one else would employ, helped his mother, the keeper of a lodging house, to wash up, etc. These people must live by some means, and must obtain light and semi-casual work. It is these general considerations which make so welcomc the long delayed arrival of our Dispensary. Acting in close agreement with the other Institutions, both Medical and Social, of the district, it will help us to an accurate diagnosis, not simply of the physical, but also of the social conditions which are at the root of our difficulties. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, M. E. Bibby, Sanitary Inspector. 59 INSTITUTIONS AND AGES OF PERSONS NOTIFIED DURING 1911: — Ages. Poor Law Cases. Cases Notified by the St.'Pancras Dispensary.

In Part III. (Infectious Diseases) of the same Annual Report paragraphs relating to human glanders were quoted, and it was explained that in future, by the Order, a Veterinary Inspector must report the existence of glanders to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough as well as to the County Council. During the year 1911 the Veterinary Inspector reportes 5 outbreaks of glanders in horses in various stables in the Borough. § 3.—ISOLATION AND EXCLUSION.

In the last Annual Report an account was given of the action taken by your Council in regard to hospital accommodation for Puerperal Fever. On the 16th July, 1910, the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board adopted a reconnnendati >11 of their General Purposes Committee " that the Local Government Board be informed that the Managers are prepared to make arrangements for the reception of certified eases of Puerperal Fever into their Hospitals." There the matter still stands. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION FOR OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Your Council, in March, 1911, received a communication from the London County Council forwarding a copy of an Order made by them requiring the notification, in the Administrative County of London, of cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum, which had been approved by the Local Government Board. Your Council also, 011 the 12th April 1911, considered as to hospital accommodation for this disease, and were informed that out of a total of 116,560 births in London in 1909 about 30,000 births were attended by midwives. From these .30,000 births there were about 165 eases of infants found to be suffering from inflammatory eyes, and of these about 16 cases, or one-tenth, were such as might have to be sent to the hospital for treatment. From these figures it was seen that there would probably be about 60 eases of Ophalmia Neonatorum a year in London which would need hospital treatment. The Metropolitan Asylums Board having already agreed to provide accommodation in their hospitals for cases of Puerperal Fever, your Council were of opinion that it would be possible for them to also provide for the small number of cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum at the same time, and recommended that the Metropolitan Asylums Board be asked to consider the advisability for providing a ward 011 the north and a ward on the south side of the Thames for urgent eases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum at the same time as providing similar separate accommodation for Puerperal Fever cases. The Board have not taken and are not likely to take any action M.A.B. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION FOR CONSUMPTION. The question of hospital accommodation has often been before the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and by them has been referred to the Local Government Board. It is still under consideration. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION FOR MEASLES. On the '6th July, 1910, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, on the recommendation of their General Purposes Committee, resolved, " That the Local Goverment Board be informed that the Managers are willing to arrange for the reception tentatively of measles, and other approved diseases, in their fever hospitals, provided the Board can empower them to admit selected cases from the poorer classes for which 110 accommodotion is now available." 62 The Local Government Board approved of this course, and in April, 1911, the Metropolitan Asylums Board commenced to receive Poor Law Cases of measles and whooping cough. On the 30th May, 1911, the Local Government Board issued an Order under Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prescribing the following regulations and restrictions, subject to which non-pauper cases of measles may be received into the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board : — Article /.—The Metropolitan Asylums Managers shall not receive into any of their hospitals a person to whom this Order applies, unless, in their opinion, they have more accommodation available than is required for the reception of the pauper patients suffering from measles, whom the Managers are authorised to receive. Article II.—Except as hereinafter provided a person to whom this Order applies shall not be admitted by the Metropolitan Asylums Managers into any of their hospitals, except on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health for the District of the Sanitary Authority for the execution of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in which the person is residing at the time when the question of his removal to hospital arises. The recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health shall in every case be sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Managers, and shall be accompanied by such information respecting the circumstances of the case as the Metropolitan Asylums Managers may reasonably require : Provided that the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Managers may, if he receives general authority in that behalf from the Managers, direct that a person to whom this Order applies shall be admitted into a hospital of the Managers otherwise than on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health, if, in the Clerk's opinion, the admission of such person is desirable on the ground of sudden or urgent necessity, or for some other special or exceptional reason. The Clerk shall report to the Hospitals Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Managers at their next ordinary meeting the name of any person admitted to a hospital of the Managers on his direction, and the grounds on which his direction for the admission of such person was given. Article III.—If it becomes necessary to determine the priority in which persons to whom this Order applies shall be admitted into any hospital, the Metropolitan Asylums Managers shall have regard to each person's need of isolation in the interests of the public health, so far as the same can be ascertained from the information sent to them by Medical Officers of Health in pursuance of Article II. of this Order, with the recommendations relating to the admission to hospital of persons to whom this Order applies. 63 At the Conference of Metropolitan Cities and Boroughs 011 matters relating to Public Health, it was resolved:— (a) (1) That a better organisation is desirable in London for the control of measles in schools. (2) That during a serious outbreak of measles children under five years of age should be excluded from school attendance. (3) That compulsory notification of measles is desirable. (4) That the cleansing of infants' departments and of the furniture, lower walls and floors thereof, shall take place once a week. (5) That accommodation should be provided in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals for urgent non-pauper cases of measles. (/>) That in the interests of public health the school regulations should provide that all children from houses infected with measles should be prohibited from school attendance. 64 EXCLUSION OF CHILDREN FROM SCHOOL ON ACCOUNT OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND DISORDERS.

THE CLEANSING OF CHILDREN. During the year the baths were used by 1,764 adults (males, 1,691 ; females, 73). The children bathed numbered 2,369. Bedfellows of children to the number of 397 were also cleansed. The addresses given by the male adults included Rowton Houses, 261 ; common lodging houses, 1,056 ; and 347 stated that they had slept in the open on the night previous to making application. The children resorting to the baths from the schools in the Borough have received a considerable amount of attention during the year, and numerous visits have been paid to their homes by the Woman Inspector. The statutory powers of the Council for dealing with the cleansing of verminous persons are briefly as follows: — 68 The Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, empowers the Borough Council to expend money in providing a cleansing station. The General Powers Act, 1904, enables the Borough Council to deal with the homes. The General Powers Act, 1907, confers compulsory powers on the County Council for the removal of verminous school children and verminous inmates of common lodging houses to cleansing stations. The Children Act, 1908, enlarges the powers with regard to school children, and compels the Borough Council to permit the use of their cleansing station by the local education authority for the cleansing of school children upon an agreed payment. Negotiations were continued with the London County Council (Education Department) with regard to the possibility of the Borough Council arranging definitely to bath verminous children at a fixed charge per head, in accordance with the provisions of Section 122, Sub section (3) of the Children Act, 1908, above mentioned. A letter was received from the Education Department of the County Council stating that the Council's Committee were still of opinion that the interval of three days between the dates of cleansing proposed by the Borough Council was insufficient to enable the nurses to certify whether or not the cleansing had been effected, and regretting that they were, therefore, unable to vary the terms of the draft agreement. The importance of the three days interval is vital, as unless it is insisted upon the cleansing of the children will be indefinitely prolonged, with the added risk of infecting other children ; and, further, the loss of the prospect of diminishing and stamping out the amount of vermin prevalent, and of reducing the expenditure upon the freeing of children from vermin, will follow. Your Public Health Committee considered that the views of this Authority in the matter should be personally placed before the County Council's Committee, and, therefore resolved, on the 10th May, 1911, that the Committee of the County Council dealing with the matter he asked to receive a Deputation consisting of Councillors C. Williams, G. Blount and C. A. Coggan, and the Medical Officer of Health. A communication was then received stating that the County Council's Subcommittee, before whom the Deputation appeared, could not see their way to recommend the County Council to accede to this Authority's request that an interval of not more than three days should be allowed to elapse between each cleansing of a particular child, but that they would endeavour, as far as possible, to meet the points raised by the Deputation. Also, that they had under consideration a proposal to increase the existing staff of School Nurses in order to cope with the work involved in their comprehensive scheme for the cleansing of verminous school children, and that it was proposed that when the additional staff was appointed, one Nurse shall be allocated to each Cleansing Station to insure that systematic arrangements were made for the attendance of school children thereat. It was further stated in the communication that if, in the operation of this scheme, it was found possible to send children at intervals of three days they 69 would bo glad to adopt this course, and they hoped that the Borough Council would be prepared to co operate, upon the basis of the draft agreement, in securing the cleansing of school children infested with vermin. On receiving this letter the attention of your Committee was called to the numbers of school children attending the Council's Cleansing Station for the four weeks prior to the Deputation attending before the County Council's Committee and the four weeks subsequent thereto, which were as follows : — Four weeks Before the Attendance of the Deputation.—63, 62, 53, and 88 children attended the Station each week respectively. Four weeks Subsequent to the Attendance ot the Deputation. — 14, 15, 17 and 13 children attended the Station each week respectively. This falling off in attendance may have been the result of the absence of School Nurses on holidays, or because of their engagements elsewhere, but nevertheless your Committee could not but regard the small number of school children who, during the second four weeks referred to, attended the Station as a serious obstacle in the way of effective cleansing of the children, and it strengthened them in their opinion that it was imperative, if the satisfactory grappling with this matter was to be attained, that the children should be directed to attend for cleansing at intervals of not more than three days until completely cleansed. In the absence of such a provision in the proposed agreement your Committee could not see their way to advise the Council to enter into the agreement, and the County Council were so informed. The matter was subsequently under discussion and consideration between the Committees of both Bodies, and on the 8th November, 1911. the Solicitor to the County Council wrote saying that the County Council would have no objection to the following words being added to the proposed agreement:— (a) The London County Council will endeavour to obtain the attendance of children at intervals of not more than three days, provided that in cases under Statutory Notice the intervals shall be determined by the necessities of the legal procedure. As the printed scheme of the County Council for the cleansing of bodies and clothing of verminous school children provided that the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough Council should receive a form stating that a Statutory Notice under section 122 of the Children Act, 1908, would be served upon the parent or guardian of a child in each case where legal proceedings were contemplated, your Committee considered it unnecessary to refer in the proposed agreement to the need for such a notice. Your Committee learned, however, that the County Council considered it necessary, in cases where proceedings against, the parents or guardians of school children were to be taken, to cut the children's hair, because the Act says that the Officer of the Education Authority may convey to a cleansing station and there detain a child until the cleansing has been effected, and that the only alternatives were, that they shall detain the child for about a week for repeated cleansings without cutting the hair, or shall cut the hair and complete 70 the cleansing at one sitting and the .Solicitor to the County Council stated, in a letter of the 19th December, 1911, that this opinion was based upon the decision of a Magistrate dealing with cases of verminous school children. Members of your Committee objected to the cutting of children's hair, being of opinion that with an average of three attendances in a week the cleansing could be effected without it. Your Committee considered this was a matter more for the decision of the County Council, but desired it to be made quite clear that the officers of the Borough Council were not to cut the children's hair under any circumstances, and that the following clause should also be inserted in the proposed agreement, viz. :— (b) If the hair of a child is required by the Statutory Notice to be cut, the school nurse or other qualified person, on behalf of the prosecuting authority, shall cut such hair previous to the cleansing. In regard to the general means of cleansing, your Committee were further of opinion that, in order to prevent any misunderstanding, the following further clauses should be added to the proposed agreement: — (c) The cleansing of children shall be carried out by the Borough Council Attendant in such a manner as shall be agreed upon between the School Medical Officer of the County Council, and the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough Council. (d) The Borough Council will open and keep open the said Cleansing Station at St. Pancras Gardens (herein referred to as the Cleansing Station), on every day in every week (exclusive of Sundays, Public Holidays, and Bank Holidays) from the date hereof, between the hours of 9 o'clock in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, on Saturday, 9 o'clock in the morning and 1 o'clock in the afternoon, for the use of children who may be sent to the Cleansing Station by the County Council, in pursuance of this agreement, provided also that no tramps or undesirable adults are admitted to the same Cleansing Station." These recommendations were approved by the Borough Council on the 17th January, 1912, and have since been accepted by the County Council. The agreement as finally approved is as follows:— 1.—The Borough Council will open and keep open the said Cleansing Station at Cambridge Street (herein referred to as the Cleansing Station) on every day in every week (exclusive of Sundays, Public Holidays, and Bank Holidays) from the date hereof, between the hours of 9 o'clock in the morning and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, 011 Saturday 9 o'clock in the morning and 1 o'clock in the afternoon, for the use of children who may be sent to the Cleansing Station by the County Council, in pursuance of this Agreement; provided also that no tramps or undesirable adults are admitted to the same Cleansing Station. 2.—The cleansing of children shall be carried out by the Borough Council Attendant in such a manner as shall be agreed upon between the School Medical Officer of the Count}' Council, and the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough Council, 71 3. — The London County Council will endeavour to obtain the attendance of children at intervals of not more than three days, provided that in cases under Statutory Notice the intervals shall be determined by the necessities of the legal procedure. 4.—If it is necessary that a child's hair should be cut in order that the child may be properly cleansed in accordance with a statutory Notice given by the Council, under Section 122 of the Children Act, 1908, the School Nurse or other qualified person, on behalf of the Council, shall cut such hair previous to the cleansing. 5.—The Borough Council will provide sufficient and competent assistants for the purpose of effecting the cleansing of children under this Agreement, the cleansing of girls to be effected by women only. 6.—The cleansing station shall, during the continuance of this Agreement, be kept entirely separate from any premises used by the Borough Council for the isolation of suspected cases of infectious disease contacts. 7.—The Council will pay to the Borough Council in respect of each child cleansed under this Agreement the sum of 2s., such payment of 2s. in respect of each child to cover a period of one calendar month from the date upon which the first cleansing takes place and within the period specified if shall be irrespective of the number of baths required before a child can be regarded as cleansed. 8.—The Borough Council will render quarterly accounts to the Council in respect of the payments to be made by the Council under this Agreement and for the purpose of verifying the amounts payable by the Council will produce for the inspection of the Council's Officers such vouchers, books, and other documents as may reasonably be required. 9.—The Agreement shall remain in force for one year from the date hereof provided always that if the parties hereto shall so agr e by memorandum in writing under the hands of the Clerk of the Council and the Town Clerk of the Borough Council the Agreemeet may be renewed upon the terms stated in such memorandum. THE CLEANSING OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. Infants' Departments. On the 21st December, 1910, your Council, upon the recommendation of your Public Health Committee, resolved—"That the London County Council be urged to give directions for the washing out of the Infants' Departments of their schools once a week instead of once in three weeks." At the Conference of Metropolitan Cities and Boroughs on matters relating to Public Health, convened by the London County Council, at Spring Gardens, on Thursday, (ith April, 1911, it was resolved—"That the cleansing of Infants' Departments and of the furniture, lower walls, and floors thereof, shall take place once a week." On the 22nd November, 1911, a report was made by the Medical Officer of Health on the cleansing of schools, when attention was called to the large 72 number of oases of diphtheria notified amongst the children attending the Infants' Department of the Princess Road School. Certain of the class-rooms were disinfected and the disinfectors reported that the rooms were in a very dirty condition. From this and other information your Public Health Committee came to the conclusion that the washing out of schools and the systematic cleansing thereof was not conducted in such a manner as to do all that was possible to minimise the danger of the spread of infectious disease among school children, and being strongly impressed with the necessity of arrangements being made for the weeklyy washing out of all Infants' Departments of the schools, resolved that:— (a) The London County Council be informed that the Borough Council are dissatisfied with the arrangements at present made for the cleansing of schools, and that they be asked to give instructions for the washing out of all Infants' Departments once every week in future. (i) A copy of the report of the Medical Officer of Health, and a copy of the Disinfector's report as to the condition in which the two classrooms at the Princess Road School were found by him, be forwarded to the London County Council for their information. Later, a communication was received from the Education Officer enclosing copy of a revised scheme for the cleaning of Public Elementary Schools and Centres, and the County Council's decision thereon. The Education Officer stated that the decisions of the County Council were the outcome of a full investigation and prolonged consideration of the position and duties of school-keepers, and of the arrangements hitherto in force for the cleansing of schools and centres. The chief object of the new scheme was to raise the standard of cleanliness of the schools by allowing a considerably augmented staff of women cleaners, by providing materials instead of making payments to school-keepers for the purchase thereof, and by systematic inspection of the condition of cleanliness of each school. It was estimated that an additional sum of about £13,000 a year would be spent in wages of charwomen, and that, generally speaking, each school would have allowed to it between 14 and 17 hours per week additional assistance by cleaners. A further important provision in the scheme was that when school buildings were used for purposes other than day school purposes, the County Council would employ additional assistance necessary for the extra cleaning involved. All rooms are swept and dusted daily in respect of their use for day school purposes and again in respect of their use in the evenings. The general rule with regard to the scrubbing in force is that every room must be scrubbed once in three weeks, and babies' rooms in infants' departments once each week.

(ii) When the mode of sub-letting appears to be such as to necessitate periodical supervision of the sanitary condition of a house, a complete inquiry is made into the mode of occupation of each room of the house. (iii) When it has been decided to register a tenement house, each room is measured as to its dimensions and capacity and recorded in the Register. The forms in which the reports as to these matters are made were quoted in the Annual Report for 1904. (b) Tenement Houses.—During the year 14 inspections and 10 re-inspections were made for the purpose of measuring tenement or lodging houses which it had been decided to register, and at the end of the year 2353 houses were upon the Register.

The loss from empties only amounted to £17 7s. 6d. (equal to .92 per cent.) out of a gross rental of £1,725 2s. 0d. A sum of £9 10s. 9d. was also received for the use of the sheds, and £190 7s. 4d. from the baths, us compared with £133 13s. 11d. for the previous year. With reference to the baths at Prospect Terrace, the Metropolitan Water Board required that the water supply should be taken by way of meter. This necessitated alterations to the service pipes, &c., and your Public Health Committee therefore instructed the Architects to obtain quotations for the necessary work. The Architects forwarded an estimate from Messrs. WontnerSmith, Grey and Company, Engineers, to perform the work as provided for in the specification for the sum of £21 9s. 0d.. which included the running of new pipes and all necessary builders' work, but exclusive of the building of the chamber for the water meter, which was done by the Water Board. The advantage gained by these alterations is that a better supply of water is obtained in place of the old supply, which was found to be inadequate. There is a credit balance of £158 2s. 10d. on the Goldington Buildings Account, £551 19s. 1d. on the Flaxman Terrace Account, and £237 0s. 4d. on the Prospect Terrace Account, making a total of £947 2s. 3d., now standing to the credit of the Repairs Funds at 31st March, 1912. Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place Schemes. On the 20th December, 1911, your Public Health Committee reported upon certain proposals made on behalf of the Midland Railway Company for the purpose of improving the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place areas, so as to defer the carrying out of the Improvement Schemes relating thereto, and the recommendation that no objection be raised to the proposals of the Company provided that in the matter of rehousing or otherwise in regard to the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place areas the Council's position was not prejudiced thereby, was adopted. A similar resolution was previously adopted by your Council in respect of the improvement of the air space in and around Weir's Passage, which forms a part of the area included in the Chapel Grove Improvement Scheme. 88 A communication was subsequently received from the Local Government Board asking for the observations of your Council on these proposals, and, on the 24th April, 1912, the Local Government Board were informed that your Council had already acquainted the Midland Railway Company with the fact that they would not raise any objection to their proposals provided that in the matter of rehousing or otherwise in regard to the Chapel Grove and Eastnor Place areas your Council's position was not prejudiced thereby. In Chapel Grove it is suggested that the eight houses, Nos. 2 to 10, 18, and 20, Chapel Grove, and No. 2, Chapel Mews (now called Clark's Yard), which are now shut in by stabling and other buildings, should be removed and the sites converted into open paved yards. The remaining houses will then have better air space back and front. At Eastnor Place it is suggested to pull down Nos. 1 to 6, Ossulston Place, so as to open up back and front Nos. :i to 6, Eastnor Place, and also to pull down Nos. 7 to 10, 16 to 18, 24 and 25, Eastnor Place. Of the houses which it is suggested should be pulled down, eight were found to be vacant in July last. At the same time a detail'd inspection was made by the Midland Railway Company to ascertain what other vacant suitable accommodation there was in and immediately surrounding the above areas, when there were found over 70 houses in whole or part vacant, and containing some 225 vacant rooms. Seymour Row. (South Side). In February, 1911. the London and NorthWestern Railway Company voluntarily ceased to let the houses on the south side of Seymour Row, Seymour Street, as dwelling-houses, namely, numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19. No. 11 was excepted because it was found to be in a better sanitary condition than the rest, and the tenant had properly so maintained it for many years. UNDERGROUND ROOMS. Underground Dwellings.—These are controlled under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sections 96, 97, and 98. Underground Sleeping Rooms.—These are now controllable under Regulations to be made by your Council under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, Section 17 (7), and your Council adopted the following draft Regulations on the 13th December, 1911:— Regulations as to Underground Rooms habitually used as sleeping places. Whereas by Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act., 1909, it is enacted as follows: — Sub-Section 7. A room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room, shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be a dwelling house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either— 89 (a) is not on an average at least seven feet in height from floor to ceiling ; or (b) does not comply with such regulations as the local authority, with the consent of the Local Government Board, may prescribe for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such rooms, and the protection thereof against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation: Provided that if the local authority, after being required to do so by the Local Government Board, fail to make such regulation or such regulations as the Board approve, the Board may themselves make them, and the regulations so made shall have effect as if they had been made by the local authority with the consent of the Board. Provided that a closing order made in respect of a room to which this subsection applies shall not prevent the room being used for purposes other than those of a sleeping place; and that, if the occupier of the room after notice of an order has been served upon him fails to comply with the order, an order to comply therewith may, on summary conviction, be made against him : Now therefore we, the Mayor, aldermen, and councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras, being the local authority for the said Metropolitan Borough, hereby prescribe the following regulations with which a room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room shall comply, namely : — (a) Such room shall in every part thereof have at least three feet of its height above the level of the surface of the street or ground adjoining or nearest to such room: Provided that if the width of the area hereinafter mentioned is not less than the height of the room from the floor to the said surface, or is not less than six feet, the height of the room above such surface may be less than three feet, but not in any case less than one foot. (b) Every wall of such room shall be constructed with a proper damp-proof course, and, if in contact with the soil, shall be effectually protected against dampness from that soil by means of a vertical damp-proof course or otherwise. (c) There shall be outside of and adjoining such room and extending along the entire frontage thereof and open upwards from six inches below the level of the floor thereof an area properly paved and effectually drained and at least four feet wide in every part: Provided that the width of such area may be not less in any part than three feet, if the mean width of the area be not less than four feet: Provided also that in the area there may be placed steps necessary for access to the room, and over and across such area there may be steps necessary for access to any buildings above the room, if the steps are so placed in such case as not to be over or across any external window of the room. (d) The space (if any) beneath the floor of such room shall be provided with adequate means of ventilation, 90 (e) Every drain passing under any such room shall he properly constructed of a gas-tight pipe. (f) Such room shall be effectually protected against the rising of any effluvia or exhalation by means of a layer of good cement concrete at least six inches thick laid upon the soil of the site of the entire room, or in some other equally effective manner. (y) Every such room which is without a fireplace, and a flue properly constructed and properly connected with such fireplace, shall be provided with special and adequate means of ventilation by a sufficient aperture or air shaft which shall provide an unobstructed sectional area of 100 square inches at the least. (h) Such room shall have one or more windows opening directly into the external air, with a total area clear of the sash frames equal to at least one-tenth of the floor area of the room, and so constructed that one-half at least of every such window can be opened, and that the opening may in every case extend to the top of the window. Underground Livring Rooms.—These are mainly used for the purpose of preparing, cooking, and partaking of food—that is, they are practically underground domestic kitchens. Underground Working Rooms.—These are used either as workshops or as offices, and efforts are being made to control some of the worst types. Underground bakehouses have been under the control of the Factory and Workshop Acts for many years. § 4.—SCHOOLS. At the 40 grant-receiving schools, 16 inspections and 0 re-inspections were made during the year by the Woman Inspector. The Board of Education having decided to relieve Local Authorities from the obligation to provide school places for children under the age of five years, the age at which compulsory school attendance begins, many authorities are ceasing to admit school children from three to five years of age. Infectious Diseases as concerning schools is dealt with in Part III., § 3, Isolation and Exclusion. THE CLEANSING OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. On the 21st December, 1910, your Council resolved—" That the London County Council be urged to give directions for the washing out of the Infants' Departments of their Schools once a week instead of once in three weeks." At the Conference of Metropolitan Cities and Boroughs on matters relating to Public Health, convened by the London County Council, at Spring Gardens, S.W., on Thursday, 6th April, 1911, it was resolved—" That the cleansing of Infants' Departments in Elementary Schools, and of the furniture, lower walls, and floors thereof, should take place once a week." In reference to the above resolutions the following is an extract from the " London County Council Gazette," August 26th, 1911;— 91 SWEEPING OF SCHOOL PREMISES, CLEANSING WALLS, Etc., VENTILATION, Etc. Instuctions to school,keepers. Attention is drawn to the necessity for exercising the utmost care in order to reduce to a minimum the danger to health arising from dust in the school premises. Schoolkeepers are accordingly specially directed to observe the undermentioned instructions:— (a) Ventilating inlets and Tobin tubes must be swept, and the internal walls and grates freed from all dirt and dust once a month. The door at the foot must be used for the purpose, and kept locked at all other times. (b) All mats must be thoroughly scraped, brushed, and cleaned, and the space below the scrapers must be cleaned out retry nigh'. (c) Under 110 circumstances whatever is dry sweeping or dusting in school buildings allowed. W herever possible, damp saw-dust must be used in sweeping the floors. Where saw-dust cannot be obtained, or in those portions of the classrooms occupied by dual desks, where it may not be possible to make use of damp saw-dust, the floor should be sprinkled with clean water before sweeping. (d) While the sweeping is actually being done, whether in the evening or on Saturdays, all windows and ventilators must be kept wide open. They must be kept open until all signs of dust have disappeared and the air is quite sweet and fresh. The windows must then be closed, and the surfaces of the desks, tables, seats, chairs, and window cills wiped over with a clean damp cloth to remove deposited dust and dirt. (e) The tops of all cupboards and ledges must be thoroughly freed from dust at least once in every three weeks before the floors are scrubbed. (f) The walls and cornices must be swept with the Turk's head broom (which is supplied) at often as may be necessarv to keep them thoroughly clean ; the painted dadoes on the walls must be kept well brushed and dusted, and also the glazed brickwork which is above the dado height on the walls of staircases and landings, and which is within reach without the use of ladders. Once a year all the dadoes and glazed br.ckwork must be rubbed over and cleansed with a cloth well moistened with turpentine or other approved material (which will be supplied on application at the Clerk of Works Office), one third of the school to be done during each of the Easter, Midsummer, and Christmas school holidays. Schoolkeepers are to note that these instructions apply to the whole of the premises for the cleaning of which they are hold responsible, including all centres, schools for blind, deaf, and defective children, offices, &c., as well as to the ordinary school buildings, except in Plenum ventilated schools, where the opening of windows and the cleansing of Tobin's tubes do not apply. 92 It will be observed in the above instruction to Schoolkeepers— (1) That no differentiation is made between Infants' and other Departments of Elementary Schools, but that all departments and all kinds of Schools are treated alike (see end of paragraph). (2) That no period is fixed for sweeping the floor, but the inference appears to be once a week for sweeping the floors and dusting the desks, tables, seats, chairs, and window cills although it is not specifically so stated (see paragraphs c and d). (3) That the tops of cupboards and ledges are to be dusted "at least once in every three weeks before the floors are scrubbed." From the last few words one gathers as by a side issue that the floors are to be scrubbed once in every three weeks, although it is not specifically so stated. (4) That at often as may be necessary the walls and cornices, the painted dadoes, and the glazed brickwork above the dado which is within reach without the use of ladders must be swept or dusted. There is no maximum interval stated, but once a year all the dadoes and glazed brickwork must be rubbed over and cleansed with a cloth well moistened with turpentine or other approved material. In framing a scheme for the cleansing of schools, four series of factors are embraced - (1) the kind of department or school, (2) the processes to be employed in cleansing, (3) the periods or intervals of employment of the processes, and (4) the surfaces or objects to be cleansed (1) The Department or School specially considered by the Council and the Conference was the Infants' Department, which is usually a separate school or premises. (2) The processes in cleansing are (a) dusting and sweeping, (b) washing and wiping, and (f) rubbing and polishing. (3) The periods or intervals of cleansing may be (a) daily, (b) weekly, (e) monthly, (d) quarterly — that is, at the end of each term at the Christmas, Easter, and Summer holidays. (4) The surfaces or objects to cleanse are (a) floors, (b) lower walls, (c) surfaces of furniture, fixtures and ledges, including window cills, (d) upper walls and cornices, and (e) special objects, such as ventilation inlet and tubes, mats, mat spaces, &c. Putting these various factors together, a reasonable time table may be constructed on the following lines:— Cleansing of Infants' Departments of Elementary Schools. A.—Dusting and Sweeping. Daily—The surfaces of the furniture, fixtures, and ledges (including window cills), lower walls and floors, also mats and mat spaces. Monthly—Ventilating inlets and tubes, 93 B.— Washing and Wiping. Weekly—The surfaces of the furniture, fixtures and ledges (including window cills), lower walls and floors, after preliminary dusting and sweeping. C.—Rubbing down and Polishing. Quarterly -Rubbing down the upper walls and cornices, and polishing with turpentine or other approved material, the surfaces of unpainted woodwork and metal. Provisions may also be added to the table as required for paraffining or waxing wood floors at intervals, periodically applying any substances to the floors, dadoes, and furniture, and otherwise rendering the table comprehensive and comprehensible by the addition of details as to precautions and procedure. Your Public Health Committee were on several further occasions in communication with the Education Department of the London County Council with regard to the necessity for more efficient cleaning of school premises in the Borough, and in April they received from the Education Officer a copy of a revised scheme for the cleaning of Public Elementary Schools and Centres, and the County Council's decisions thereon. This was reported to your Council on 22nd April, 1912. The Education Officer stated in his letter that the decisions of the County Council were the outcome of a full investigation and prolonged consideration of the position and duties of school-keepers, and of the arrangements hitherto in force for the cleaning of schools and centres. The chief object of the new scheme is to raise the standard of cleanliness of the schools by allowing a considerably augmented staff of women cleaners, by providing materials instead of making payments to school-keepers for the purchase thereof, and by systematic inspection of the condition of cleanliness of each school. It is estimated that an additional sum of about £13,000 a year will be spent in wages of charwomen, and it may be said that, generally speaking, each school will have allowed to it between 14 and 17 hours per week additional assistance by cleaners. A further important provision in the scheme is that when school buildings are used for purposes other than day school purposes the County Council will employ additional assistance necessary for the extra cleaning involved. All rooms are swept and dusted daily in respect of their use for day school purposes, and again in respect of their use in the evenings. The general rule with regard to the scrubbing in force is that every room must be scrubbed once in three weeks, and babies' rooms in infants' departments once each week. § 5.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. Factories.—The Men Inspectors had 409 and the Women Inspectors 107 factories upon the Registers for periodical inspection as to water service, sanitary conveniences, drainage, and nuisances. During the year 88 and 2 inspections of factories respectively were made, and 32 and 5 re-inspections after notices served. 04 Workshops.— The M en Inspectors had 1,282 (apart from bakehouses) and the Woman Inspector 404 workshops (apart from laundries) on the Registers for periodical inspection. During the year 690 and 30 inspections respectively of these premises were made, and 243 and 0 re-inspections after notices. Workplaces.—These include restaurant kitchens, cab and omnibus yards, laundries and domestic workshops and home workplaces. Domestic Workshops and Home Workplaceds.— The Woman Inspector has 71 of these on the Register, of which 2 inspections were made. These places vary in number from year to year, and according to the season of the year. Laundries.— Oil the Register are 74 laundries, at which the Woman Inspector made 2 inspections. Restaurant Kitchens.—Of these the Men Inspectors had 175 and the Woman Inspector 158 on the Registers. At the former 127 inspections and 83 re-inspections were made, and at the latter 0 inspection and 0 re inspection. Bakehouses.—At the commencement of the year there were 167 workshopbakehouses. Of these, and of the five factory bakehouses and the three bakehouses in hotels, 305 inspections and 268 re-inspections were made. Offensive Trade and Effluvia Businesses.—These arc dealt with under the section relating to Nuisances. Tabular Statements—The following is a tabular statement of the work of the Men Inspectors in the form desired by the Factory Department of the Home Office :— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.

It has not been possible to give much attention to the in-pection of industrial premises during the year 1911. It is hoped that our numerous connections with the general life of the Borough may induce persons having knowledge of serious defects in such premises to bring the facts to our notice for, with the ever increasing pressure of general health work now imposed upon us, both by legislation and by public opinion, itis no longer possible to attempt the routine inspection of all suitable premises in the old way. Being responsible for a mass of work which no one person could perform without assistance, I have endeavoured rather to act in the spirit of the ideas now influencing public work than to attempt the impossible task of 97 myself performing every duty involved, and I have taken steps so to place myself in contact with the social agencies of the district as to utilize these agencies as an intelligence department and as a channel through which Public Health ideas may permeate the whole Borough. It is impossible to speak too cordially of the kind co-operation of these agencies with our work. The work in connection with the Notification of Consumption has occupied most of my time and attention. The compulsory notification of Hospital and Dispensary cases came into force in May, 1911, and added considerably to the number of cases to be dealt with. The promotion of further means of dealing with the cases has also taken much time and the necessary assistance given in organising allied health movements has also occupied me. This organising and co-ordinating work is absolutely necessary if the best use is to be made of all the local resources, and in the face of problems so great and so important no local resourses can rightly be neglected. When the projected Tuberculosis Dispensary is fully at work it may be possible to assign some of the work now in my hands to its staff, and thus to leave me free to return to the work of industrial inspection. I have not so far asked your permission to suggest the need of further paid assistance as much of the work in hand would be difficult to delegate from its personal nature, and as our scanty office accommodation also complicates the question ; but unless some such agency as the Tuberculosis Dispensary comes into being, it may be necessary to point out that the work in hand is beyond the possibilities of any one officer. The voluntary visitors give excellent and devoted help, but they only extend the work and do not in any way relieve the responsible officers, to whose labours they are rather an addition than a mitigation. A separate report upon the work of the year in relation to Consumption is submitted to you. A table relating to industrial work is appended. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, M. E.

These conveniences for women are situated at the southern end of Pancras Road near King's Cross, at the eastern end of Park Street adjoining Camden High Street, at the southern end of Fortess Road at its junction with Kentish Town Road, at the centre of Queen's Crescent adjoining Maiden Road, and at the western end of Mansfield Road near its junction with Fleet Road. There is one free W.C. in each of the womens' conveniences. Drainage By-laws.— Attention has previously been called to the decision of the Divisional Court in Kershaw v. Brooks (7 L.G.R. 578, 1909) by way of special case from the decision of a Metropolitan Police Magistrate dismissing certain summonses issued by the Hampstead Borough Council —(1) under the plan By-laws, and (2) under the drainage By-laws made by the London County Council. The question for decision was as to who was the proper person to be brought before the Magistrate for infringement of these by-laws. The Council summoned the responsible person actually carrying out the work, and the summonses were dismissed by the Magistrate on the ground that they should have been issued against the person who ordered the work to be done. The Divisional Court sustained the decision of the Magistrate, with the result that the hitherto invariable practice of proceeding against the responsible person who actually carried out the works would be no longer open to the Borough Councils, but enquiries would have to be entered upon as to who was responsible for the work being done, i.e., who had given the order. Previous to Kershaw v. Brooks, it was the practice of this Authority to proceed against the builder as the responsible person for an infringement of the Bye-laws in question, and your Public Health Committee were strongly of opinion that the duty of complying with the By-laws in regard to the deposit of plans and the giving of notice should be placed upon the person executing the work. In view of the difficulty thus encountered, representations were made to t he London County Council, in which your Council joined, with the result that new By-laws were made in July last, and approved by the Local Government Board on the 4th August, 1911. The new By-laws are set out in Part VI. Legislation. § 4. By-laws. Combined Drainage. —A new and rather striking decision on combined drainage was given last year by the Divisional Court in the case of the House Property and Investment Company v. Grice, (1911), 9 L.G.R. 758. This case formed the subject of a detailed report from the Chief Clerk, which appears in the Council's Minutes of the 20th March, 1912. It carries the decisions much further than any hitherto reported, and should be of much service to local authorities, as it appears to be the first case in which an "order" by a local authority has been proved without a plan. It should be of material assistance in St. Pancras as there are many applications in the books of the Works Department to drain houses by combination with no plans attached. 103 § S.— STORAGE AND REMOVAL OP OFFENSIVE MATTERS. CLEANSING AND SCAVENGING. The substitution of mechanical for horse traction is rapidly reducing the amount of horse droppings in the roadways and the amount of manure stored in mews, and incidentally the number of flies. § 9.—NUISANCES, &c. Offensive Trades.— The two licensed noxious trade premises in St. Pancras have been regularly inspected, and the tallow-melting works in Tudor Place have been kept under continual observation. Effluvia Businesses.— In addition to the above businesses producing offensive effluvia, the businesses of a vendor of fried fish, a fish-curer, and a rag and bone dealer have been brought under control by Section 10, Part II., Sanitarv Provisions, of the London County Council (General Powers) Act. 1908. By this section the County Council may make by-laws for regulating the conduct of these businesses, and with respect to the premises, utensils, and appliances used in connection with these businesses, and it is the duty of the Borough Councils to enforce these by-laws. The framing of these by-laws is still under consideration. Smoke.— During the year the usual observations of smoke shafts were made by the inspectors and re-inspections made after notices served. The Inspectors limit their observations of a chimney to half an hour, and only prolong the observation beyond this period so long as a nuisance is actually being committed. § 10—SUMMONSES.

Food Inspection.—As usual, the places where food is prepared and sold have been frequently inspected and the stock examined, and with few exceptions have been found satisfactory. The cowhouses and slaughterhouses have also been regularly visited. A large number of animals were killed and dressed at the slaughterhouses during the course of the inspections, the carcases and organs being subsequently carefully examined with a view to the detection of disease. The markets and market streets have been specially inspected on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings during the four summer months from June to September. At the Conference of Metropolitan Cities and Boroughs on matters relating to Public Health, the following resolutions ware pussed in reference to places where food is prepared and exposed for sale :— (a) That it is desirable that regulations should be made to limit the pollution resulting from exposure in an improper manner, in public places or adjacent to the public way, of food and food receptacles. (b) That it is desirable that all places where food is prepared for sale should be regulated by by-laws made by the London County Council and administered by the Sanitary Authorities, and should be subject to annual licensing by the Sanitary Authority.

The Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the relations of human and animal tuberculosis made its final report. The Commissioners were appointed to inquire and report with respect to tuberculosis— (1) Whether the disaase in animals and man is one and the same ; (2) Whether animals and man can be reciprocally infected with it. (3) Under what conditions if at all, the transmission of the disease from animals to man takes place, and what are the circumstances favourable or unfavourable to such transmission. In answer to the first question the conclusion arrived at is that " man must therefore be added to the list of animals notably susceptible to bovine tubercle bacilli," and that " whether one prefers to regard bovine tuberculosis and the cases of tuberculosis in man which are caused by the human type of bacilli as varieties of the same disease or as independent diseases, there can be no question that human tuberculosis is in part identical with bovine tuberculosis." As regards the second term of the reference the report states that mammals and men can be reciprocally infected with tuberculosis, that bovine animals are not completely immune to the human tubercle bacillus and adult human beings can be infected with the bovine type, even the pulmonary form of this disease in man being sometimes caused by the bovine tubercle bacillus. In answer to the third question, viz., under what conditions, if at all, the transmission of tuberculosis from animals to man takes place, and what are the circumstances favourable or unfavourable to such transmission, the report states that, as regards human tuberculosis, " animals, domestic and other, which have been found capable of suffering from severe generalised tuberculosis of the human type are comparatively few," and that " probably only where the cow or goat has received a large dose of tuberculous material derived from man does the human tubercle bacillus escapc into the blood stream of the animal, reach her milk sinues and become eliminated with her milk." It cannot, however, the report goes on to say, be confidently affirmed that man is wholly free from risk through animal food, although the degree of danger cannot at present be determined. Turning to bovine tuberculosis, the report shows that as regards the individual cases under observation of persons suffering from tuberculosis, the lesions of the disease (especially pulmonary tuberculosis) when fatal have been referable, with few exceptions, to human bacilli. On the other hand, the report states that " there can be no doubt that a considerable proportion of the tuberculosis affecting children is of bovine origin, and particularly that which affects primarily the abdominal organs and the cervical glands." The report goes on to say that "judging by our feeding experiments there would appear to be strong presumption that as regards most animals comparatively large doses given either singly or by frequent repetition are necessary to produce by ingestion acute progressive generalised tuberculosis, though we have recorded instances in which a very small dose administered but once has produced this result. Applying a like presumption to man (and our observations on the monkey and chimpanzee in this connection afford warrant for so doing) it may be asked in what way are children, the members of the human family who are- 109 especially liable to exhibit acute fatal tuberculosis commencing as an abdominal affection, most likely to obtain a large and fatally infective dose of tubercle bacilli ? As already indicated by us, to this question there can be but one answer—namely, that the evidence which we have accumulated goes to demonstrate that a considerable amount of the tuberculosis of childhood is to be ascribed to infection with bacilli of the bovine type transmitted to children in meals consisting largely of the milk of the cow." In conclusion the report refers in the following terms to the steps that should, in the opinion of the Commissioners, be taken to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis—" Meanwhile we, in view of the evidence adduced by us, regard ourselves as called upon to pronounce on administrative measures required in the present for obtaining security against transmission of bovine tubercle bacilli by means of food. In the interests therefore of infants and children, the members of the population whom we have proved to be especially endangered, and for the reasonable safeguarding of the public health generally, we would urge that existing regulations and supervision of milk production and meat preparation be not relaxed ; that on the contrary, Government should cause to be enforced throughout the kingdom food regulations planned to afford better security against the infection of human beings through the medium of articles of diet derived from tuberculous animals. " More particularly we would urge action in this sense in order to avert or minimise the present danger arising from the consumption of infected milk. And in this connection it may be convenient lor us to repeat certain facts observed by us in reference to the conditions tending to the elimination by the tow of bovine tubercle bacilli in her milk; facts in our opinion of such importance that they formed the subject of our third interim report. Bovine tubercle bacilli are apt to be abundantly present in milk as sold to the public when there is tuberculous disease of the udder of the cow from which it was obtained. This fact is, we believe, generally recognised though not adequately guarded against. But these baci li may also be present in the milk of tuberculous cows presenting no evidence whatever of disease of the udder even when examined post-mortem. Further, the milk of tuberculous cows not containing bacilli as it leaves the udder may, and frequently does, become infective by being contaminated with the fæces or uterine discharges of such diseased animal. We are convinced that measures for securing the prevention of ingestion of living bovine tubercle bacilli with milk would greatly reduce the number of cases of abdominal and cervical gland tuberculosis in children, and that such measures should include the exclusion from the food supply of the milk from the recognisably tuberculous cow, irrespective of the site of the disease, whether in the udder or in the internal organs." Bacterioloqical Examination of Milk.— Twenty samples of Milk were taken by the Food Inspectors at the principal railway stations in St. Pancras for bacteriological examination. These samples were sent to Dr. Eyre, at Guy's Hospital, and his report appears in detail in the Council Minutes of the 29th November, 1911. Upon the reception of this report the Council passed the following resolutions : — (a) " That the Council view with serious concern the condition of the milk examined at the railway stations in St. Pancras as shown in the bacteriological report, and express the strong conviction that legislative action should be taken forthwith which would ensure that clean and wholesome milk be sent to the people of London." 110 (b) "That a copy of the bacteriological report and the foregoing resolution be sent to the President of the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, and the London County Council."

In 54 cases summonses were issued, with the result that penalties were inflicted amounting to £106, and costs £29 18s. 6d., which have been recovered and paid to this authority.

The proceedings were under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and were taken by the Council at the instance of the Earl of Carrick, Inspector of Irish Interests in Great Britain, on behalf of the Irish Department of Agriculture, whose temporary resident Assistants acted as agents for the Council's Inspectors in purchasing the samples. For the prosecution it was stated that the reputation of Irish butter had suffered from the practice of certain dealers in selling margarine as a substitute for the article demanded ; that the margarine sold now-a-days was not as good as of old, as it was composed of vegetable oils instead of animal fat, and that at Is. a pound, at which price Irish butter was to be obtained, margarine of the value of 5d. was sold. At the Marylebone Po'ice Court on Friday, the 19t,h May, 1911, six summonses were heard by Mr. Plowden for selling margarine as butter. These proceedings were also taken by the Council, and the method of sampling was the same as in the preceding cases. All these samples were taken by the Food Inspectors of the St. Pancras Borough Council, operating in conjunction with special Inspectors of the Irish Board of Agriculture, for the purpose of cheeking a custom, which was considerably increasing, of serving customers with margarine when butter was asked for. These special Inspectors had paid regular visits to shops in St. Pancras, and were looked upon as regular customers. At first they were supplied with butter when they asked for it, but when they came to be looked upon as tegular customers they were served with margarine. The result was that in St. Pancras alone, out of sixteen shops sampled, fourteen were found to have served margarine instead of butter. The summonses were issued under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, which provides that no person shall sell to the prejudice of the purchaser any article of food which is not of the nature, substance, and quality of the article demanded, under a penalty not exceeding £20. By Section 17, Sub-Section 1, of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, the penalty upon a second conviction may be increased to £50, and upon any subsequent conviction to £100. By Sub-Section 2, where a person guilty of an offence is liable to a fine exceeding £50, and the offence, in the opinion of the Court, was committed by the personal act, default, or culpable negligence of the person accused, that person shall be liable (if the Court is of opinion that a fine will not meet the circumstances of the case) to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a period not exceeding three months. Notwithstanding these provisions and the fact that several of the defendants had been previously convicted (in one case three times, in another ease twice), the Magistrates only imposed a penalty of 40s. and 12s 6d. costs in each case. Having regard to the inadequate penalties imposed, your Committee, with the concurrence of the Council, placed the whole of the facts before the Home Secretary, the President of the Local Government Board, and the President of the Board of Agriculture. 113 The following correspondence shows the action taken by the Government Departments :— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 18th March, 1912. Sir, Sale of Food and Drugs' Acts—Penalties. I am directed by the Local Government Board to inform you that the Secretary of State for the Home Department has recently drawn the attention of Justices of the Peace to the Home Office circular of the 24th July, 1902, on the subject of the inadequate penalties which are often imposed by them for breaches of the Sale of Food and Drugs' Acts. The Board have received many representations on the same subject, and they think it desirable that local authorities concerned in the enforcement of the Acts should be acquainted with the Home Office circulars, a copy of which is enclosed, for use in cases in which it is desirable to press for heavy penalties. It will be observed that the second paragraph of the circular of 24th July, 1902, refers to particulars of the number of small fines inflicted in respect of offences under the Acts committed during the year 1900. Statistics in the Board's possession for the following ten years show that the proportion of penalties not exceeding 10s. still remains very high, the proportion which such fines bear to the total number, which was 28½ per cent. in 1900, being nearly 28 per cent. in 1910. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. J. "Willis, Assistant Secretary. The Clerk of the County Council, or The Town Clerk. Home Office, Whitehall, S.W. 10th January, 1912. Sir, Sale of Food and Drugs' Acts—Penalties. I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that, in consequence of representations recently received from Local Authorities charged with the enforcement of the provisions of the above Acts, he thinks it right to draw attention to the Home Office circular of the 24th July, 1902, which will be found reprinted overleaf. Later figures obtained by the Local Government Board in connection with this subject demonstrate the large proportion of cases still occurring under these Acts in which penalties are imposed of such a small amount as to suggest that the offence is regarded as being of an altogether trivial character. The Secretary of State will 114 therefore be glad if you will bring the circular to the notice of your justices with a view to securing careful consideration of the adequacy of the penalties which they may decide to impose in cases under the Sale of Food and Drugs' Acts. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Edward Troup. The Clerks to the Justices for the Petty Sessional Divisions and Boroughs. 24th July, 1902. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform you that a local authority charged with the enforcement of the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts has recently called his attention to the inadequate penalties imposed for breaches of these Statutes, and has represented that the efforts made to suppress the abuses against which the Acts are aimed are hereby greatly impeded. This representation is by no means the first of the kind which has been made to the Home Office, and the Secretary of State is informed by the Local Government Board that they have from time to time received many similar complaints from the local authorities entrusted with the administration of the Acts. The matter was considered by the Select Committee of the House of Commons, which inquired into the subject of the adulteration of food products in 1896, and their report contains the following passage : — " There has been a general agreement among the witnesses who have given evidence in reference to this subject that the penalties imposed in respect of offences under the Acts are for the most part trifling and quite insufficent to serve as deterrents. Your Committee have been told that fines such as 10s. with 12s. costs are frequently inflicted." Notwithstanding the attention, however, which was then drawn to the matter, the Local Government Board informed the Secretary of State that in the year 1900, out of 2673 fines imposed by Magistrates under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, no less than 764, or over 28½ per cent. were of 10s. or less, while 19.3 penalties were under 5s., and 118 were Is. or even less than that sum. It is unnecessary to point out the injurious consequences of the adulteration of articles of food or the large and sometimes enormous profits that accrue from the practice ; and it is obvious that when the penalty on detection is trifling, it not only fails to be deterrent, but may even spread the mischievous impression that the offence is venial. The Secretary of State does not wish to be understood as suggesting that these considerations are lost sight of by your bench, but the figures appear to be sufficient to show that the state of things to which the Parliamentary Committee called attention has not yet been set right, and he will be glad if you will bring the matter to the notice of the Justices, in order that, as 115 occasion arises, they may give special consideration to the question whether the penalties imposed in the cases that come before them are such as are likely to deter the offenders from repeating, and other persons from committing, the offence. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, KENFLM E. Digry. EXTRACTED PARAGRAPHS. The three following items are extracts from the Annual Report of the Local Government Board for 1910-11, see the part relating to the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts: — Vegetable Fats substituted for Animal Fats.— Many of the samples of margarine examined during the year contained a large percentages of cocoanut oil, and regarding some of these the analyst for Cheshire, writes :—" All "the (21) samples of margarine were found to contain upwards of DO per cent. " of fat foreign to butter fat. The 21 samples may be divided into two kinds, " viz., nine consisted almost entirely of beef or mutton oleo and stearin whilst " twelve were mixtures of the above fats, with more or less cocoa-nut oil. In '* eight of the latter cases there were from 35 to 50 per cent. of cocoa-nut oil ; "these were very skilfully prepared mixtures, and in many respects stimulate " genuine butter fat in their analytical character. It is quite conceivable that " an analyst relying upon preliminary tests alone might be led to pass such a " fat as pure butter fat, so closely did it physically resemble the real article." Owing to the high price in the last few years of all products derived from the pig, there has been a large increase in the importation into this country of cheap lard substitutes, which in a number of cases are sold as lard without declaration. Lard substitutes, with large percentages of water, from which lard itself is almost entirely free, have been offered to the public, while lard, lard substitutes and margarine have all been found adulterated with paraffin. We issued a memorandum to local authorities drawing attention to these points, and asking to be supplied with information as to the results of any analyses that might be made during 1910. A copy of the memorandum will be found on page 31. The return shows a large increase in the number of samples of lard taken for analysis in the past year, while as many as 1-4" samples of lard substitutes (inrluded under " other articles ") were examined under the following names :—beef lard, nutola lard, lardine, lard compound, compound, &c. The analyst for Kent referring to two samples of watered lard (No. 79 and 107), and to the Board's memorandum, writes :—" We were already on " the alert. It is interesting to observe that these offences area recrudescence "of similar practices that were common enough 20 and more years ago, "culminating in 1888, when, as my own record show, from 30 to 40 per cent. " of the lards then sold were adulterated in a similar fashion. The practices "continued till about 1895, since when, until quite recently, the practice "become obsolete. The two last mentioned samples Nos. 79 and 107 "Ashford, sold as ' compound lard ' were in fact chiefly composed of cotton 116 "seed oil, with which had been incorporated 10 per cent, of water as a make " weight, to be sold at the price of the fatty contents. Now lard (beyond a " trace) contains no water whatever ; it is therefore only reasonable to expect " that lard substitute, or imitation lard, whatever its fatty contents may be, "shall in like manner be free from water. Consequently any lard substitute "or lard mixture containing 10 per cent, of water sold without distinct " declaration of fact is thereby, pro tanto, sold to the prejudice of the purchaser. " It may be fair, even praiseworthy, to invent or introduce a new food, and " persuade a customer to spend his money thereon, so long as the substitute is " a genuine imitation of the article it is intended to replace, but it is sheer " cheating to incorporate water with such substance in order that extraneous " water may be sold at the price of the essential material it replaces." Declaratory Noticcx of Substitutes.—The use of informal sampling in Islington has revealed the large extent to which retailers resort to declaratory notices when supplying articles different from those asked for. In 36 cases where the inspector asked for Demerara sugar, a parcel was handed to him which in 27 cases contained a declaration that the article supplied was not Demerara sugar, but some kind of dyed crystals. 32 samples of malt vinegar were asked for; 10 were found to be spurious, and in eight cases something different was supplied, the purchaser being informed that it was not malt vinegar. In 92 cases coffee was asked for, and in over one-half the inspector or his agent received packets of coffee and chicory, most of them being accompanied by a declaration that a mixture had been given. Such trading cannot be considered satisfactory to the public, especially when it is remembered that a main principle of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts is that a purchaser is entitled to receive the article which he has demanded. DEFINITION OF VINEGAR. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 15 th December, 1911. (Copy.) Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Hoard to advert to the deputation from the London and Country Vinegar Brewers' Association, Limited, received by the President on the 30th October last on the subject of a Standard for Vinegar, and I am to state that the Board have not at present any power to frame definitions of vinegar or artificial vinegar. The Board, however, think it may be desirable that they should state their views on the subject. In the Board's opinion the following definitions might properly be adopted, viz. :— General Standard fou Vinegar. Vinegar is a liquid derived wholly from alcoholic and acetous fermentations ; it shall contain not less than 4 grammes of acetic acid 117 ('CH3COOH) in 100 cubic centimetres of vinegar ; it shall not contain arsenic in amounts exceeding 0.0143 milligrammes per 100 cubic centimetres of vinegar, nor any sulphuric or other mineral acid, lead or copper, nor shall it contain any foreign substance or colouring matter except caramel. Malt Vinegar is derived wholly from malted barley or wholly from cereals, the starch of which has been saccharified by the diastase of malt. Artificial Vinegar. Artificial Vinegar is any vinegar or substitute for vinegar containing, or derived from any preparation containing, any added acetic acid which is not wholly the product of alcoholic and subsequent acetous fermentation. It shall contain not less than 4 grammes of acetic acid (CHsCOOH) in 100 cubic centimetres of the artificial vinegar. It shall not contain arsenic in amounts exceeding 0.0143 milligrammes per 100 cubic centimetres of artificial vinegar, nor any sulphuric or other mineral acid, lead, or copper, nor shall it contain any foreign substance or colouring matter except caramel. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. J. Wilms, Assistant Secretary. W. Davenport, Esq., Secretary, The London and Country Vinegar Brewers' Association, Ltd., Ridler Place, Holland Street, Blackfriars, S.E. Proposed amendment and consolidation of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.— A communication was also received from the Kensington Borough Council stating that they had communicated with the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture "urging the necessity for immediate action to be " taken in the direction of introducing legislation for the purpose of amending and consolidating the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, of laying down for the " guidance of Local Authorities definite standards or limits in respect of all " the principal classes of foods in common use, of establishing a Court of " Reference as mentioned in the recommendations of the Departmental Com" mittee of 1001, and of adequately dealing with the difficulties surrounding " the questions of 'Warranties' and 'Disclosures' as protecting the vendor " of an adulterated or otherwise sophisticated article of food." Your Council concurred with these views, and similar representations were made to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture on the 17th January, 1912. No. of Sample. Article.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sut, I herewith Submit my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1911. Market*.—The market streets, costermongers' barrows, stalls, fish shops, and curing premises have been inspected daily, 2,109 inspections being made. The following articles of food have been destroyed, the same being unsound or diseased, and unfit for human food:— Rabbits, 24. Lobsters, 1 cwt. Crabs, 1 cwt. Apples, 30 lbs. Pears, 14 lbs. Lettuce, 28 lbs. Onions, 28 lbs. Pork fat, 56 lbs. Cherries, 16 lbs. Haddocks, 1 trunk. Fowls, 60. Ducks, 6. Food Makers. —I have made 480 inspections where food is prepared, such as sausage polonies, pies, etc., and have found all the ingredients used sound, wholesome, and fit for food, and the premises generally in a clean and sanitary condition. Ice Cream Maker* —159 inspections have been made by me, and I have not found it necessary to report to the Committee any cases for prosecution. Slaughter-houses.—I have made 271 inspections of the slaughter-houses in my district, and have not found any diseased or unsound animals; the premises have been kept clean, and the London County Council By-laws properly observed by the holders of licences. Cowsheds.—There are three licensed cowsheds in my district, registered for 70 cows. 56 inspections have been made, the animals kept clean, and the London County Council By-laws observed. Milkshops and Dairies. - I have made 352 inspections of the above-named places during the year, and there have not been any prosecutions for infringement of the By-laws. It is very difficult to get the keepers of small general shops to use any precautions to protect the milk from contamination, and I find it is useless calling their attention to the danger ; they seem to treat the matter as of no importance, and as official ''busybodyism" if you do speak about it. Food and Drugs Act.—I have submitted 325 articles of food to the Public Analyst. 120 Legal Proceedings.—I have attended at the Police Court 45 times in connection with my duties as prosecuting Food Inspector. I am, Sir, yours obediently, J. Osborne, Food Inspector. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit my report for the year 1911. I made 721 visits to the market streets, 40 visits to premises where food is in course of preparation for sale, and took 100 samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. 123 visits were made to the licensed slaughter-houses, where I saw the following animals killed and dressed :— 98 Bullocks 125 Sheep 16 Lambs and examined the following carcases : — 23 Beef 83 Mutton — Lamb making a total of 345 animals and carcases examined. 156 inspections were made of cowsheds, milkshops, and dairies. I had the following food destroyed by fire at the dust destructor, viz. :— 2 carcases of Beef and organs. Tuberculous 2 pairs of Ox lungs. ,, 2 Ox heads and tongues. „ 1 Ox liver. Flukes 1 ,, Abscess 6 cwt. Potatoes. Decomposed 60 lbs Skate. „ 2½ cwt. Beef and Mutton. ,, 1 trunk uncured Haddocks. „ 10 boxes of Kippers. „ 5 gallon tins of Prawns. ,, 60 Fowls. „ 6 Ducks. ,, 1 trunk of Coal Fish. ,, I am, yours obediently, W. G. Auger, Food Inspector. \ 121 To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report on my work in the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1911, as Inspector of Food and Food Places. Markets.—I made 1,923 inspections of the various market places, including butchers, pork butchers, fishmongers, and greengrocers shops and stalls, and made applications when necessary to the magistrates sitting at the Police Courts to condemn and order to destroy certain unsound food. The following articles were removed and destroyed from my district, being unfit for the food of man, in cases where the food was not seized it was removed at the request of the owners in writing under Sub-section 8 of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 : — 2 cwt. 0 qrs. 10 lbs. Beef and Mutton. 8 cwt. of Potatoes. 14 cwt. 0 qrs. 12 lbs. Plums. 300 Lemons. 5 boxes of Oranges. 1 box of Apples. 1½cwt. of Skate. ½ cwt of Coal fish. 10 boxes of Kippers. 12 Fowls. Foodmakers.—I made 338 visits to the premises where sausages, tripe, &c. are made and found the premises generally satisfactory, utensils clean, and the food sound. Licemed Slaughter-homes.—There are 4 slaughter-houses in my district, I made 222 inspections, during which I saw a large number of sheep, bullocks, pigs, and lambs killed and dressed, and such organs, as on examination, were found to be diseased I had removed on the written request of the owners under Sub-section 8 of Section 17 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, viz.:— 3 bullock's lungs, 1 bullock's liver and heart affected with Tuberculosis, 1 bullock's liver affected with an abscess, 1 sheep's carcase and organs wet and emaciated, these were destroyed by burning at the dust destructor. Licensed Cowsheds.—I paid 53 visits to the cowsheds and found them satisfactory and the By-laws generally observed. Milkshops.—I made 460 inspections of milkshops, and with few exceptions found the milk vessels clean. During these visits I found several persons selling milk without being registered in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders. Sate of Food and Drugss Acts.—I obtained 325 samples of food and drugs, and submitted them to the Public Analyst for analysis under these Acts, 32 of which were adulterated. Of the samples of milk, 18 were taken promiscuously at the St. Pancras (M.R.), Kentish Town (M.R.), and King's Cross (G.N.R) Stations, and none were found to be adulterated. 122 Ice Cream Makers.—I made 175 inspections of ice cream makers premises and barrows, and on 21 occasions found breaches of the by-laws as to dirty utensils, &c. In some cases the proprietors were cautioned by order of the Public Health Committee. Daring the year I attended before the Magistrates at the different Police Courts 41 times in the discharge of my duties. Harry R. Child, Inspector of Food and Food Places. VI.—LEGISLATION. In the Annual Report for 1909, under Part IV.—Sanitation, § 1 —Inspection, and paragraph "Staff" a list of General and Special Acts, Orders, By-laws and Regulations, passed since 1888 to 1909 inclusive, affecting Public Health, was given. § 1.—GENERAL ACTS. National Insurancr Act, 1911. An Act for insurance against sickness. The Rag Flock Act, 1911. The object of this Act, which came into operation on the 1st of July, is to prevent the sale and use for manufacturing purposes of unclean flock made from rags. Description of Offences. The Act renders it illegal for any person (1) to sell or have in his possession for sale flock manufactured from rags, or (2) to use for the purpose of making any article of upholstery, cushions, or bedding, flock manufactured from rags, or (3) to have in his possession flock manufactured from rags intended to be used for any such purpose, unless the flock conforms to such standard of cleanliness as may be prescribed by regulations to be made by the Board. Any person who sells, uses, or has in his possession flock in contravention of the Act becomes liable on summa'y conviction to a fine not exceeding, in the case of a first offence, ten pounds, or in the case of a second or subsequent offence, fifty pounds (section 1 (1) ). Regulations. The Local Government Board have in hand the preparation of the regulations. Duty of Sanitary Authority. It is made the duty of the Council, as the Sanitary Authority for their district, to enforce the provisions of the Act within their district. For this purpose the medical officer of health, or sanitary inspector, or any other officer whom the council may appoint, is empowered if so authorised by the Council, to institute and carry on any proceedings which the council are authorised to institute and carry on under the Act, and to enter at all reasonable times any premises in which he has reasonable cause to believe that an offence under the 123 Act is being committed, and to examine and take samples for the purpose of analysis of any flock found on the premises. But where a sample is taken the occupier of the premises is at liberty to require the officer taking the sample to divide it into two parts and to mark, seal, and to deliver to the occupier one part. A person who wilfully obstructs any officer in the execution of his powers as above-mentioned will render himself liable on summary conviction to a tine not exceeding five pounds (section 1 (5)). Proceedings against Offenders. In connection with proceedings against offenders it should be noted that where a person is charged with having flock in his possession in contravention of the Act, any flock proved in the proceedings to have been found in his possession is to be deemed to be intended for sale or for use in the manufacture of such articles as above-mentioned, unless the contrary is proved (section 1 (4)). It may be further pointed out that in the proceedings it will be open to any person, who is proved to have committed an offence, to show that he (1) purchased the flock in respect of which the offence was committed from a person resident within the United Kingdom who sold the flock under a warranty that it complied with the prescribed standard of cleanliness, and further (2) took reasonable steps to ascertain, and did in fact believe in, the accuracy of the statement contained in the warranty. In such a case the person charged will be entitled upon an information laid by him to have the person who gave the warranty brought before the Court and that person may be summarily convicted of the offence in question, and if so convicted may be made liable, in the discretion of the Court, to pay any costs incidental to the proceedings, and the person originally charged is to be exempt from any fine (section 1 (3) ). Expenses. The expenses of the Council under the Act are to be defrayed as part of the •expenses incurred by the Council in the execution of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (section 1 (6) (b) ). Application of Penalties. All fines imposed in any proceedings instituted by the Council in pursuance of their powers and duties under the Act are to be paid to the Council and carried to the credit of the fund out of which the expenses incurred by them under the Act are defrayed (section 1 (7)). Indi cation (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1911. (1 & 2 Geo. 5. Ch. 32). Exemption of School Buildings from Builiing By-laws where plans approved by Board of Education. 38 & 39 Vict. c. 55. 3. The provision of any by-laws made by any local authority under section one hundred and fifty-seven of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended by any other Act, with respect to new buildings (including provisions as to the giving of notices and deposit of plans and sections), and any provisions 124 in any local Act dealing with the construction of new buildings, and any by-laws made with respect to new buildings under any local Act, shall not apply in the case of any new buildings being school premises to be erected, or erected, according to plans which are under any regulations relating to the payment of grants required to be, and have been approved by the Board of Education. § 2.—LOCAL ACTS. The London County Council (General Powers) Acts, 1911, contained no provisions affecting public health. 3.—§ ORDERS. Reception ot Cases of Measles.—Metropolitan Asylum District, 30 th May, 1911.

The recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health shall in every case be sent to the Metropolitan Asylum Managers, and shall be accompanied by such information respecting the circumstances of the case as the Metropolitan Asylum Managers may reasonably require. Provided that the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylum Managers may, if he receives general authority in that behalf from the Managers, direct that a person to whom this Order applies shall be admitted into a hospital of the Managers otherwise than on the recommendation of a Medical Officer of Health, if, in the Clerk's opinion, the admission of such person is desirable on the ground of sudden or urgent necessity, or for some other special or exceptional reason. The Clerk shall report to the Hospitals Committee of the Metropolitan Asylum Managers at their next ordinary meeting, the name of any person admitted to a hospital of the Managers on his direction, and the grounds on which his direction for the admission of such person was given. Article III.—If it becomes necessary to determine the priority in which persons to whom this Order applies, shall be admitted into any hospital, the Metropolitan Asylum Managers shall have regard to each person's need of isolation in the interests of the public health, so far as the same can be ascertained from the information sent to them by Medical Officers of Health in pursuance of Article II. of this Order, with the recommendations relating to the admission to hospital of persons to whom this Order applies. Article IV.—This Order may be cited as the Metropolitan Asylums (Measles) Order, 1911.

Extract from Circular Letter of Local Government Board, Dated 16th November, 1911. Powers and Duties of Councils. In a disease such as tuberculosis, the prevention of infection, and the treatment of the patient frequently cannot be separated. In certain cases it is no doubt desirable that the local authority should be able to offer sanatorium treatment, and for this the powers of the Public Health Act, 1875, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are available. Under these powers local authorities may either themselves provide sanatoria or may contract for the use of such institutions. The Board have been advised that these powers also enable a local authority to provide or contract for the use of dispensaries or out-patients' hospitals. Treatment in an institution is not, however, always necessary or desirable, and there are many cases which, under suitable instruction and supervision, may properly be treated in the patients' own homes. 132 Accordingly the Board have, bv the Order, given a general power to the local authority, on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health, to supply such medical assistance, facilities and articles as may be necessary for detecting Pulmonary Tuberculosis, for preventing the spread of infection, and for removing conditions favourable to infection. The local authority are also empowered to appoint any necessary additional officers. In considering in what ways they can best aid in the control, treatment, and prevention of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, local authorities should carefully take account of existing agencies. Apart from the actual treatment of cases, the Board would again urge 011 local authorities the great importance of their making full use of their powers of preventing overcrowding, and of securing the removal of any conditions tending to injure the health of persons residing in their districts. § 4.-BY-LA.WS.

No new Regulations were made during the year. 133 § 6.—LEGAL DECISIONS. Effect of "Kent v. Fittall. The difficulty is the decision of the Court of Appeal in Kent c. Fittall (75 J.P., 378; The Times Law Reports, July 19, 20). The unceasing efforts of the Devonport objector have at last brought about a threatened disfranchisement of very many voters, though the probable effect of the decision may well be misunderstood in view of the different reasons assigned in giving judgment for the appellants by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. The Point in Dispute. There have been four cases in which the various parties have been represented by "Kent" and "Fittall," though the same point has not always been the cat,tlx belii, whatever the final cause of the dispute might have been. Suffice it to say, however, that the chief point in dispute has been this : that the names of certain persons were retained on the list in Division I. of the occupiers' list (occupiers in Division I. must be doubly qualified—first, as Parliamentary electors, and secondly, as County Council electors) as occupiers of premises, whereas in fact tho-e persons had not occupied the premises either as owners or as tenants for the 12 months immediate.y preceding July 15th in the year. The three facts relied upon to support the objector were (1) that the dwellinghouse formed part of a house which itself was what would be generally described as an ordinary dwelling-house; (2) that the landlord resided in the house; and (3) that the landlord was rated for the whole of the house. These three facts constituted prima facie evidence by the objector that the landlord still retained a right of control over the premises let; and the persons objected to were not able, to the satisfaction of the Revising Barrister, to displace that prima facie, evidence, notwithstanding the findings (1) that they enjoyed the sole and exclusive use of the various rooms let to them ; (2) that no services were rendered in the rooms by the landlord ; (3) that the landlord claimed no right to enter into or exercise any control over the rooms, nor had he in fact ever exercised such rights; and (4) that the persons objected to had free access at all times by means of a key provided by the landlord. These four findings on behalf of the persons objected to sufficiently indicate the class of voters to be on the border line between those inhabitant occupiers who are popularly known as "latchkey" voters and "lodgers." It is extremely difficult satisfactorily to distinguish legally these two classes of voters; and the element of dominion or general control by the person letting the rooms, irrespectively of the nature or structure of the premises, is the only trustworthy test. General Control of the Landlord. The Divisional Court decided the ease purely upon this question of general control; and, had the case stopped there, the persons objected to would have had to rely upon being reinstated at some later date as " lodgers." It is conceived that their plight would have been worse than it is under the decision of the Court of Appeal. The latter Court decided against them upon a totally different ground - namely, that, not having been rated in respect of the separate rooms occupied by them, they were on that ground alone not entitled to be placed on the register of voters as inhabitant occupiers. In fact, Lord 134 Justice Buckley assumed, for the purposes of liis judgment, that the landlord had no control, and that the claimant was an inhabitant occupier. That being the ratio decidendi of the Court of Appeal, the virtually disfranchised latchkey voter will not find relief in the camp of the lodgers. What he must do is to satisfy the conditions of Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act, 1867, which, inter alia, require (1) rating as an ordinary occupier of the premises occupied bv him within the Borough to all rates (if any) made for the relief of the poor in respect of such premises; (2) payment on or before July 20th of an equal amount in the pound to that payable by other ordinary occupiers in respect of all poor rates payable by hiin. Decision in the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal refuted the argument that this class of " latchkey " voter was entitled to be deemed to be rated —or, in other words, that he was constructively rated. They held that constructive rating applied only to two classes of cases :— (i.) Where the rates are compounded by the landlord, either by agreement or by order of a local authority. This applies to premises not exceeding £20 in the Metropolis, £13 in Liverpool, £10 in Manchester and Birmingham, and £8 elsewhere. (Sections 3 and 4, of the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act, 1869.) (ii.) Where the dwelling-house or tenement is wholly let out in apartments or lodgings (Section 7 of the Representation of the People Act, 1867, and Section 14 of the Parliamentary and Municipal Registration Act, 1878). Here the test of control is important as distinguishing the case from that in Kent r. Fittall. No one could mistake the tenement-dwellers for lodgers in the case where the whole of the tenements comprised in the building or the whole of the dwelling-house, as the case might be, is let by the landlord, and where the latter does not reside on the premises. Persons, therefore, who dwell in tenements or apartments in these circumstances will not be affected by the decision in Kent t. Fittall (No. 4) in spite of the fact that the owner is the person rated in the Overseers' books. In substance of course these cases do not really differ from the letting to a single person of a whole house, as the separate rooms in the tenement block can be regarded theoretically as constituting distinct and separable dwellings. In short, these are not "latchkey" voters at all, though their conditions of living may strongly resemble those of the voter so sorely hit by the decision now under consideration. Class of VoUrt Affected. There are two questions that are everywhere being asked—(1) Exactly what class of electors are affected ? (2) Will huge blocks of electors disappear altogether from the next register ? The decision affects all those latchkey voters who have hired, especially under verbal agreements, apartments or rooms in dwelling-houses whereof the landlord retains either by arrangement or by natural inference the general control. It is entirely a question of fact. In this respect clearly drawn written 135 ments will be of the greatest importance. Both high-class flat tenements, as well as hovels and artisans' tenements, are alike hit by the decision. But the hovel dweller and artisan usually have no written agreements, and the presumption will be that if the landlord or his agent is resident on the premises the general control remains with the landlord. There will be no distinction, moreover, between cottages, where, say, a landlady dwells on the ground-floor and lets, say, two rooms on an upper floor to tenants, and tenements or flats. But it is in the Metropolitan area that the " latchkey " voter will be most hard hit if the Revising Barristers act upon the decision, for it is there that the tenement blocks exist in greatest numbers. House farming prevails in many of the densely crowded poor parts of London —a system whereby several families live in the same house, or, worse still, where a family rents only one room—and though in these cases the tenant generally has in fact full control over his own part of the house, it may well be and often is the fact that the landlord performs certain duties, and resides somewhere 011 the premises. The saving clause in Section 7 of the Representation of The People Act, 1867, which applies the principle of constructive rating to the case of tenements wholly let out in apartments or lodgings not separately rated, does not apply to business tenements, flats, or offices. If, therefore, the tenant be not rated, he may be disfranchised, unless he can come in under the service franchise. Apparently these considerations apply only to Boroughs, and not to Counties or County Boroughs, as the enactments relating to the rating of the occupier in lieu of the owner, specially mention "boroughs" only. In short, there must be a rate paid and made in respect of the separate dwelling or other tenement to confer the franchise on the inhabitant occupier. Undoubtedly large numbers of voters will be disfranchised. Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton pointed out that the decision would " probably deprive of the right to the franchise a large number of people who, if they had known what were the necessary steps to be taken . . . would probably have obtained it." Moreover, about two years will elapse before they will be able to be reinstated, either as lodgers or inhabitant occupiers (according to which •qualification they possess), inasmuch as a claim must first be put in, to say nothing of the period of 12 months before July next, during which the claimant must have occupied the premises. Such claimants cannot be " rated inhabitant occupiers" for 12 months by July, 1912. They can apparently only fulfil the conditions by July, 1913. It is for the Legislature to supply the casus omissus pointed out by Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton, if casus omissus it be—though in a great many cases the explanation clearly enough is to be found in the fact that the claimant is in reality a lodger, who cannot prove an adequate value.—[The Tunes, September 8th, 1911). 136 VII.—REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH.
