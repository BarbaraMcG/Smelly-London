ABSTRACT OF ACCOUNTS OF THE St. Sauiours District Board of Works, For the Twelve Months ending 25th March, 1868, AND R E P O R T S OF THE CLERK, MEDICAL OFFICER, AND SURVEYOR OF THE BOARD; Compiled and Published in accordance with the 198th section of 18 & 19 Vict., c. 120.—"An Act for the better Local Management of the Metropolis," and respectfully presented to the Inhabitants of the District. CLERK'S REPORT. Since the date of their last Annual Report, the Board have carried out the Resolution, passed on the 14th November, 1866, for removal of the Wellington Clock Tower, so tar as regarded the materials of the structure, and have made arrangements with Messrs. Mowlem & Co., for the construction of a sanctuary as contemplated in the terms of the same Resolution. The removal of the tower, and formation of sanctuary, together with the necessary re-instatement of the carriage-way, are to be completed by Messrs. Mowlem, free of cost to the Board, in consideration of the materials of the tower having been gratuitously placed at their disposal. A standard lamp column with five lamps, similar in design to that near the King William Statue, will then be erected, and the small sanctuary, south of the site of the late tower, will be removed. The St. Olave's Board of Works having called the attention of this Board to the necessity for widening the entrance into St. 4 Thomas's Street, in continuation of the extensive improvement effected in that district, and invited this Board to co-opera??? with them in memorializing the Metropolitan Board of Work to contribute to the cost of so doing, by removal of houses on t??? north side ; this Board, after due consideration of the plan sul??? mitted, were of opinion that if the street were widened chiefly o??? the south side, it would form an extension in effect of the ne Southwark-street, and constitute a metropolitan improvemen On representing their views on the subject to the St. Olave's Board they fully concurred therewith, and the terms of a joint memorial having been agreed upon, the same was presented to the Metro politan Board by a deputation from the two districts on the 29??? of November last, and referred to the Works and General Pur poses Committee of that Board for consideration and report. By order of the Commissioners of Police, the following street within the "general limits" of the Metropolitan Streets Act 1867, are to be deemed to be within the "special limits" of the same, viz.— WELLINGTON STREET DUKE STREET HIGH STREET TOOLEY STREET The effect of this order is inter alia to render illegal the removal of dust from houses in any of these streets between the hours of 10 a.m. and 7 p.m., and also the loading and unloading of coal, and removal of casks by means of ropes, chains, &c., between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. The general provisions of the Act are sufficiently well known to render any reference thereto unnecessary. Two other Acts of some importance were passed during the last Session of Parliament, and are now in force, viz.—the Factory Acts' Extension Act, 1867, and the Workshop Regulation Act, 1867. By the former of these, in conjunction with previous Acts, a large number of trades have been placed under restrictions as regards the labour of children, young persons and women, which restrictions are enforced by the inspectors of factories. These trades are the following:—cotton and other textile factories, printworks, bleaching, dyeing and finishing works, lace, earthenware, fustian cutting, percussion cap, cartridge, lucifer match and paper staining factories, blast furnaces, copper and iron mills and foundries, the manufacture of metal, of machinery, of indiarubber and gutta percha, of paper, of glass, of tobacco, letter-press printing and bookbinding; and in addition to the above, any manual labour exercised for the purposes of gain, on premises where not less than fifty persons are employed in making, preparing, or finishing any article for sale. 5 By the Workshop Regulation Act, 1867, children, young persons and women employed in any manual labour on premises ???ther than the above, and whereon less than fifty persons are employed, are placed under regulations to be enforced by the Local Authority," who for this district are the St. Saviour's District Board of Works. A systematic inspection of the several workshops and factories now being made by the Inspector of the Board, and notices have been served upon the proprietors as a preliminary step ???wards enforcing the provisions of the Act where necessary. In accordance with an application made to them by this Board, the Metropolitan Board of Works have issued orders under their Common Seal for re-numbering the houses in Gt. Guildford???treet, and Red Cross-street, and both streets have been re???umbered accordingly. Orders have also been received very ???ecently in accordance with the request of this Board, for incor???orating Upper Stamford-street with Stamford-street, for discontinuing the name Lucas Cresent in Broadwall, and for ???e-numlbering the houses in both thoroughfares. The control of much re-numbering is vested in the local Board by Section 87 of the 25 & 26 Victoria, cap. 102, and the necessary notices will portly be served upon the occupiers or owners of the houses. The Board have given directions that the inclined roadway of Wellington-street from London Bridge, down to Duke-street, shall be gravelled daily to enable Horses with heavy loads to get a better footing. Since their last Annual Report was made the Board have presented Petitions and Memorials, as under, viz. : To the Metropolitan Board in reference to the proposed widening of St. Thomas's-street, as above mentioned; to Parliament praying for insertion of protective clauses in the Metropolitan Street Tramway Company's Bill (since withdrawn); to Parliament against the Bill for widening Park-lane, praying for inquiry as to whether a plan proposed by Mr. Snell, for making the required roadway, would not be the more advantageous and economical.

Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour once more to place before you a summary of the sanitary measures, adopted by this Board and its Officers, during the past year, and the statistics of diseas??? and death, for the same period, by which the health of the population is usually tested. By a careful examination and comparison of the tables with those of former years, you will be abled to deduce results very favourable to our sanitary progress And as a brief enumeration of the principal facts, in a form less repulsive than a simple array of figures, will enable you more easily to do so, I beg to offer a few customary observations by way of elucidation. The rate of mortality being taken as the criterion of health, the year 1867 was the healthiest enjoyed by the Metropolis since 1860; and, with two exceptions, this District has not exhibited so low a death rate since 1856. The number of deaths registered last year, including 25 in Guy's Hospital, was 824, being 109 fewer than the average of the preceding ten years; and, 86 less than the mortality of the year 1866. This result is not chiefly due to the disapperance of Cholera, because if the deaths from that cause were entirely eliminated from the previous years' totals there would still remain 56 in favour of last year. Admitting that the rate of mortality in any given locality is not alone an infallible criterion of its general healthiness, there are certain other facts discoverable by an examination of the tables now presented which indicate very clearly that, notwithstanding an unusual amount of distress amongst the poor last year, this district experienced a merciful immunity from other prevalent causes of disease. For example there were 244 more births than deaths registered; and it will be seen by a reference to the classification according to age that there was a diminution of 86 deaths of persons under 20 years of age, 15 of persons between the ages of 20 and 80 and an increase of 15 among persons of more than 80 years old, some reaching the extreme age of 95. These of course could not have survived much longer under conditions more favourable to health than have ever yet been attained. This point is further illustrated by an investigation of the causes of deaths. Among the diseases classed as epidemics there was a decrease in every case excepting Small Pox, in which the increase was only one. There was a decrease of 12 deaths from Measles, 12 from Scarlet Fever, 3 from Diphtheria, 21 from Hooping Cough, 19 from Typhus Fever, 8 from Diarrhoea and 31 from Cholera. It will doubtless inspire a feeling of gratitude to learn that although there were 241 deaths registered from the 9 batter cause in London, one only occurred in the St. Saviour's District. That case was, in fact, registered as a case of Choleraic Diarrhoea, but as it has been returned as Cholera by the Registrar General, I have thought it best to conform to that ???lassification. There were 34 Coroners' Inquests held in the District during the year, most of them resulting in verdicts of Death from violent and accidental causes, including 6 Suicides. In comparing the healthiness of the St. Saviour's District with That of the whole of London, and of the South Districts, it is ???aeceessary to take the population of 1861 as the basis of calculation, as the principle adopted by the Registrar General, of ???estimating the population up to the present time, although correct when applied to the Metropolis at large, would be fallacious if employed in reference to a locality of very limited area. Ac— ???croding to the census of 1861 the number of deaths to every thousand living persons [in this district was 23, in the South districts 25, and in the whole of London 25. As there can be little doubt however that the populations of many other districts have augmented to a much greater extent than that of St. Saviour's, these calculations are not thoroughly reliable. Still it is a fact that the south of Loudon now occupies an enviable position in relation to the four other great districts into which London is divided; and, there art! ample reasons for believing that St. Saviour shares in this favourable result. .Last year, to every thousand persons living the Central District suffered a mortality of 24, the Eastern district 21, the Northern district 23, the Western district 22, and the South a small fraction under 22. In every District, excepting the South, the calculations give a fraction over the numbers I have stated—their comparative extent being indicated by the order in which the names of the Districts are placed. It thus appears that the West, which has so frequently stood the most favored of the five groups, had last year to give place to the South, which now occupies the first position in relation to the total mortality of London. I bring these facts under your especial notice, because, for many years, an opinion has almost universally prevailed prejudicial to this side of the Thames, whereas improvement has been continuous until it has at last attained the place to which I have just adverted. There were 1068 births registered in the District during the year; and of the 824 deaths 25 occurred in Guy's Hospital, and 102 in the Workhouse ; 23 of the 25 persons who died in Hospital were received into that institution from other Parishes. Of the 102 inmates who died in the Workhouse, 39 were between 60 and 80 years old, and 17 above 80, so that more than half the mortality occurred among persons above 60 years of age. Only five deaths were due to Epidemic causes. In every annual report which I have had the honor to submit 10 to you the subject of overcrowded houses has occupied a place. As this evil not only continues unabated but extends itself year by year, I am impelled once more to make it a subject of complaint. That this Board is almost powerless in applying a remedy I am fully aware, but it is probable that constant reiteration may eventually be of service in checking the evil. When it is considered that the upper and middle classes arc enabled to procure a comfortable and commodious residence for about oneeighth of their income, while the labouring classes arc obliged to pay an average of one-fourth for what is really insufficient for sleeping accommodation alone, it is marvellous that this great city should continue to bo one of the healthiest in the world, especially as the deduction is in one case made from the superfluities, and in the other from the necessaries of life. Another point to which I have frequently adverted is the continuance of the antiquated system of supplying the Metropolis with water. During several months of the past, year, the waters supplied by the Metropolitan Companies have been analized by Professor Frankland, of the Royal College of Chemistry, and the result is an increase of solid impurity over the year 1866. This the Professor shews is avoidable by observing that "the New " River Company stands alone in the perfection of its filtering " apparatus; on no occasion during the past year has this " company's water exhibited turpidity, thus proving that perfect " filtration is compatible with the largest daily supply furnished " by any one company in London." But this unnecessary impurity of the water is very considerably increased by its continued distribution upon the intermittent system. In almost every town of importance in the United Kingdom this system has been abolished. By a continuous supply, not only is the danger of leakage of impure matter into the pipes avoided, but also all those well-known evils attending the storage of water in butts and cisterns under the existing system. During the year Small Pox resulted in the deaths of eleven inhabitants. As this disease doubtless causes an unnecessary waste of human life, it is satisfactory to know that during the Session of 1867, a Bill to consolidate and amend the laws relating to Vaccination, was introduced to Parliament, and received the royal assent in August last. By this Act the Guardians of the Poor are required to divide Unions and Parishes into Vaccination Districts, or to consolidate or alter them, and to contract with some medical practitioner within each District for the performance of Vaccination of persons resident in his District only. The qualification of the Vaccinator is to be prescribed by the Privy Council, who, in addition to the ordinary payment provided by the Statute, are authorized to make allowances to Public Vaccinators. Public Vaccinators and parents are liable to penalties for neglect of their respective duties, and Justices may make orders 11 Vaccination of children under 14 years of age and enforce ???nlties for disobedience. The Registrar of the District is ???quired to furnish the Guardians of the Union, twice in the ???ar, with a list of all cases in which certificates of Vaccination ???ve not been received by him, who are forthwith to make enquiry to the circumstances of the cases contained in the list, and, if ???cessary, proceed against the persons in default. The regulations for securing the efficient performance of ???accination, issued by the Lords of the Privy Council, require ???at every Vaccination District shall have in it at least one public ???ation for the purpose; and that no public vaccinator shall— ???rcept for some special reason—vaccinate any person elsewhere ???an at such Station. They also forbid, except under their ???pecial authorisation, the performance of Vaccination at any ???tation oftener than once a week. If the more stringent orders and regulations of this Act are faithfully carried out, we shall ???ossess an additional safeguard against the prevalence of this ???athsome disease, and may hope, at no distant period, to think of small Pox as a pestilence which has disappeared from our ???and. The disappearance of Cholera from the District enabled this Board, last year, to disj>enso with the extra assistance which the ???xigencies of 1866 made necessary. It will therefore excite on surprise that the sanitary work done should have been consider???ably less than that of the year preceding. Your Inspector, however, has displayed his usual vigilance, and by reference to the sanitary table, you will perceive that, among other matters of importance, 326 notices in respect of nuisances have been issued, ???65 drains, privies, and urinals, repaired and cleansed, and 30 ???slaughter-houses, 32 cow houses, and 33 bakehouses periodically inspected. It is highly probable that the recollection of the extraordinary measures of the year 1866 exerted a beneficial influence upon the inhabitants, and thus rendered the interfer???ence of your Inspector less imperative than has been the case in former years. I have thus shortly indicated the points of interest suggested by the records of the events and proceedings of the past year. The favorable sanitary condition of the District may be easily tested by an examination of the appended tables, and I trust you will consider them sufficiently interesting for perusal and comparison. Your courtesy and co-operation enable me, for the twelfth time, to make the annual acknowledgment of the considerate kindness of the Board and its officers, and with that expression, I beg to conclude, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 12 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH.-- Population at Census, 1861, 17,030.
