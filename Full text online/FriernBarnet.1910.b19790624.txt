Friern Barnet Urban District Council REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health, for the year 1910. BY FRANK A. SPREAT, F.R.C.S. Eng., D.P.H., R.C P.S., Member of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. New Southgate: Printed, by Pickering d Co., 113, Friern Barnet Road. 1910. TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE Friern Barnet Hibran District Council. Gentlemen I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 191 (J, to which is attached the Report of Mr. Albert Harrnan, which again shows a good record of sound Sanitary work done by him during the year. I should like to draw special attenton to the extremely able way in which the Sanitary Inspector dealt with the case of Smallpox early in the year, mentioned in this Report. I have again pleasure in expressing to the members of the Council my appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and assistance during the year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Frank A. Spreat. For the convenience of the Local Government Board and those not well acquainted with the District, I repeat the following short description. The District of Frieru Barnet is situated in the London area, aud is bounded on the North by East Barnet, on the East by Southgate, on the South by Hornsey, aud on the West by Finchley. 2 It comprises 1,303 acres 1 rood including 149 acres occupied by the buildings and grounds of the Colney Hatch Asylum), most of which is undulating ground, varying from 150 to 300 feet above the sea level, the geological formation being London clay with here and there patches of gravel. 7he General Character of the District.— For the purposes of representation, statistics. &c., it is divided into three Wards—North, South, and Central; and in addition Colney Hatch Asylum—situated between the Central and South Wards—is treated separately to a great extent, as to include the deaths of such an institution with those of the District would create a mistaken and adverse impression. The population is unevenly distributed; thus in the North Ward a large part is pasture land, and the houses for the most part are of a higher rateable value, being detached and separated some distance from each other, but during the year several houses of lower rent have been built. The houses in the Central ward are chiefly semi-detached, and in terraces and streets. Many new houses have been built lately. The South Ward is the most thickly populated, the houses being of the usual six-roomed kind, and are inhabited in many cases by more than one family. In this Ward also there is the tendency to the erection of flats, and the conversion of six-roomed houses into flats. The Bounds of the District were beaten by the Overseers on 3rd May, 1910, and additional boundary plates have been fixed where necessary. Vital. Statistics. Population.— I have before explained the methods taken for estimating the intercensal years and the reasons which have led me to adopt the figure 5.6 for estimating the population. Taking the number of occupied houses in the middle of the year as 2075 and multiplying by 5 6 gives an estimated population of 11,620. 3 The population in 1881 was 4,403; in 1891, 6,716; and in 1901, 8,816; the average number of persons per house being respectively 6.01 and 5.6 for the two latter years, as estimated from figures supplied from the Census Offices by the Registrar-General. Total population at all ages at Census of 1901:— District, 8,816; Asylum, 2750 11,56(5 Number of inhabited houses 1,633 Average number of persons per house 5.6 The following table gives the number of occupied and unoccupied houses together with the estimated population far each Ward for this year. Wards. North. South. Central. Total. Houses Occupied 439 973 663 2075 ,, Unoccupied 30 210 88 328 Estimated population 2458 5449 3713 11620 The population per acre in 1901 was approximately 8. at the present time it is nearly 10.5. Births. These numbered 351, giving a birth-rate of 30.2, being an increase of 1.2; the 1908 rate of 31.9 being an increase of 3 on the 1907 rate, and at the same time our record rate. The birth-rate for the adjoining Districts for 1909 were, East Barnet, 21.5; Finchley. 20.3; Hornsey, 15.3; and Southgate, 19.6. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 351 — 105 =246; the excess in 1908 being 213; in 1907, 177; and in 1906, 152. 4 Deaths. There were 97 deaths (Tables I., II., and IV.) registered in the District, excluding the Asylum, giving a deathrate of 8.3. an improvement of 1.3 on 1909. Fifteen deaths occurred outside the District of persons belonging to it, giving a net total of 97—15=112, showing a net death-rate of 9.6,and producing a death-rate corrected for age and sex distribution by the factor l'U774, of 10-2. Deaths (centring between the ages of 1—5 years.— These numbered 8. One of these, the only one in the year, was due to Scarlet Fever, one to Whooping Cough, one to Epidemic Influenza, one to other Tuberculosis Diseases, one each to Bronchitis and Pneumonia, and two to 'all other" causes. Deaths between 5—15 years of age.— Only four deaths occurred at this period, one, the only one of the year, from Diptheria, two from heart disease, and one from an accident. Deaths between 15— 25.—Three deaths took place at this age, the cause of death of one, the only one of the year, being Enteric Fever, of the second Phthisis, of the third "all other" causes. Deaths between 25— 65.—Forty deaths occurred at this age. Phthisis claiming 5; Cancer 3; Bronchitis 5; Heartdisease 13; Suicides 2; other respiratory diseases 1; and all other" causes 11. Deaths between 65 and upwards.— Thirty-one occurred at this age. Thus rather over twenty-five per cent, of the recorded deaths were of persons who had reached a good age. Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under one year was 26, four less 5 than in 1909, giving an infant mortality rate of 74, an improvement of 17 when compare 1 with 1909, and of 56 when contrasted with 1906. On referring to the table of deaths under one year, it will be seen that two deaths were attributed to diarrhœral diseases, It has been abundantly shewn that high infant mortality follows periods of high temperature and low rainfall, accompanied as they are with dust, plagues of flies, deterioration of food, &c., &c., causing in a marked degree intestinal disorders, and that, on the contrary, periods of low temperature and high rainfall are followed by lower mortality. Apart from the influence of atmospheric conditions, I think that the very satisfactory decrease in our infant mortality is partly due to the Notification of Births Act, the effect of our short card of " Hints to Mothers," sent immediately upon receipt of a notification of birth, together with the greater attention paid to the cleanliness of house, person and food by all those, midwives, lay helpers and friends, brought in contact with the mother and child. The following is a table comparing the number of houses occupied and unoccupied, the population, births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate since 1885, giving an idea of the growth and health of the District during that period:— G Year.

The Zymotic death.rate—deaths from the following infections diseases—Small.pox, Measles, Scarlatina, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, Fever (Typhus, Typhoid aud Continued), was 6. The principal Epidemic Diseases Death-rate in previous years was:— 1884 2.1 1893 2.3 1902 1.4 1885 1.2 1884 ... 1.6 1903 1.4 1086 2.7 1895 0.9 1904 1.1 1887 0.8 1896 1.5 1905 1.0 1888 1.5 1897 2.5 1906 1.5 1889 0.7 1898 1.9 1907 0.58 1890 1.6 1899 2.5 1908 0.47 1891 1.5 1900 0.5 1909 0.63 1992 1.0 1901 1.8 7 It will be seen from Table III. that (excluding the Asylum) 56 Notification Certificates of Infections Diseases were received, as compared with 50 in 1906,78 in 1907, 122 in 1903, and 114 in 1909. The decrease being due to the fewer number of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever cases. Bacteriological Examinations. The application of this process for diagnostic purpose continues to increase, and has been much appreciated. Reports on Diphtheria, Type of Elimination No. of Specimens. Negative. Positive. Total.

Of the foregoing 10 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis or Phthisis and 4 of Erysipelas were norified from the Asylum or in connection with that institution. One subsequently withdrawn. Smallpox. One case was notified in the District at the beginning of the year. This is the contact to which reference was made in my Report for last year, and I now give the history of the case. Early in December 1909, I received notice from the Medical Officer of Health for Tottenham. Dr. Butler Hogan, that a man, A.S., living in Friern Barnet, had been in contact with a man, x, residing in Tottenham, who was suffering from Smallpox. I interviewed A.S., who was apparently well and most unwilling to give any information, asserting that his friend x at Tottenham was not really ill and only had chickenpox. A.S. and his family shared the house where he lived with another family, the members of which were suffering from Influenza and at the time were being attended medically daily and the opportunity was taken of also keeping A.S. under strict observation, with the result that the attack was diagnosed and notified at the earliest possible moment. A.S. complained of feeling ill on December 31st, aud was notified on January 4th, the diagnosis being confirmed next day by Dr. Prior, Medical Officer of Health for Finchley. A.S. was a member of a travelling dramatic company which had been touring in Russia. When at Warsaw some members of the troup were brought into contact with another troup at the Cirkus Ciuselli, known as the Flatelini Brothers. A clown of this latter troup was taken ill and died shortly after, and was buried on November 15th, the disease being thought to be "Black Pox." The troup of which A.S. was a member left Warsaw and went to Dantzic, where one of their number, W.C., 9 feeling ill, consulted a Doctor, who does not appear to have made any diagnosis, but offered the patient Hospital accomodation. W.C., however, being anxious to come home, asked if he could travel to England, and was told that if he kept himself well wrapped up he might do so. He travelled to Islington via Hook of Holland and Harwich. When in England he consulted a Doctor who is stated to have certified that he was suffering from chicken pox. In consequence of the above case of the disease not being recognised at first, I am told that three cases of Smallpox occurred in Islington, but unhappily the trouble was not confined to that District for, during his convalescence, W.C. was visited by x of Tottenham (who gave rise to three cases in Tottenham) who in turn was visited by A.S. of Friern Barnet, and here the outbreak was fortunately stayed. At the lime of the notification, 5 p.m., January 4th, Friern Barnet was entirely without provision for the Isolation of Smallpox. Endeavours were immediately made to obtain accomodation, Authority after Authority was applied to by telephone all, tor various reasons, declining or being unable to assist. At last, at 1 1 p.m., as a final resort, I applied to Dr. Prior, the Medical Officer of Health for Finchley, and having stated our urgent position requested him to appeal to his Authority for permission to admit thy case into the Finchley Smallpox Hospital for a few flays. On January 5th Dr. Prior informed me that under the special circumstances he had been authorised to take the case, and the patient was removed immediately by the Sanitary Inspector to the Finchley Smallpox Hospital. Steps were at once taken to provide permanent Smallpox accomodation and arrangements were made, and subsequently confirmed, for Friern Barnet to become a contributary Authority to the Middlesex Joint Smallpox Hospital Board, and the case was removed, at the end of the third day, by the Joint Board's officials to their Hospital at South Mimms. As before mentioned, there were two families in the 10 infected house giving rise to ten "contacts." It was decided to try to induce the ten inhabitants to submit to quarantine for a period of 14 days. This they agreed to. The room occupied by the patient was disinfected and stripped by the Sanitary Inspector. The arrangements for conflating, provisioning, &c., the two families were entrusted to and were well find tactfully carried cut by the Sanitary Inspector. During his marketing, the Sanitary Inspector was supplied with margarine instead of butter. With the help of the County Inspector this fraud was verified and proceedings taken which resulted in a conviction. All contacts were vaccinated or re-vaccinated. This outbreak shows how disease may be dissiminated. being rapidly carried from one part of Europe to another and producing foci of infection, apparently independent but in reality connected. In this instance the investigations of the Islington Sanitary Officials and the prompt transmission of the results of their inquiries to The Sanitary Officers of the respective districts in which the contacts resided, enabled steps to be taken which stamped out the threatened epidemic. I should not like to conclude the above remarks without making due acknowledgement of the very neighbourly action of the Finchley Authority in receiving this case into their Hospital for us, and mentioning my indebtedness to their Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Prior, for his kindly and courteous assistance all through. SCARLET FEVER. There were 22 cases notified (as compared with 60 in 1909). They were fairly evenly distributed in the three Wards. 14 cases were removed to Hospital. There was one death. 11 Diphtheria. There were 16 cases notified (as compared with 27 in 1909). There were 6 each in the North and Central Wards and 4 in the South Ward. There was no death. On reference to the results of the Bacteriological Examinations it will be noticed that there were twice as many negatives as positives. Enteric Fever. There were four cases notified. Two in the North and and two in the South. There was one death. The patient had recently returned from Germany. Puerperal Fever. There was one case. Typhus, Relapsing Fever. Cholera. There were no cases. Erysipelas. Six cases were notified. Measles. This disease was prevalent in the Central Ward during September and in December. On the first occasion the Holly Park Council School was attacked. On inquiries being made, it was found that out of 276 children only 45 had not had the disease and that 37 of the 45 were in the four youngest classes. The senior class, consisting of 50 pupils, only having 3 scholars who had not had this malady. It was decided not to close the school. There were in all about 12 cases. On the second occasion. The Infants' Department of St. John's School, Glenthorne Road, was affected. The disease spread rapidly and the Infants' Department was closed for the last fortnight of the term. There were not any deaths. 12 Whooping Cough. Several cases occurred during the year, and there were 3 deaths. The importance of this disease is hardly realised by the general public. Mumps. Were prevalent at the Middlesex Council Infants' School during the autumn. Phthisis and other Tuberculous Disease. Six cases of Phthisis were notified as belonging to the District. There were six deaths from Phthisis and one from other Tuberculous disease, giving an approximate deathrate of front Phthisis. In each case, it has been the practice for many years past, on a case beirg brought to notice the premises are visited, the nature of the disease explained, and disinfectants and leaflets supplied. Disinfection after removal aud fatal cases is carried out as far as possible, and has generally been readily accepted. There is not any hospital accommodation for this disease. Pauper eases are, as far as possible, seut to a sanatorium. Asylum.—In this institution there were 13 deaths from Tuberculosis. Isolation is now carried out in separate buildings. Cancer There were five deaths due to this cause, being less than .5 per 1000. Infectious Diseases other than those notifiable under the Act. This year, 1910, is the first year of systemic notification of disease by the School Teachers. 13 The following notifications have been received, viz:— Disease. Number Notified. Area of District affected. Mumps 133 Chiefly in the South Ward Measles 82 Chiefly in the Central and South Ward North of the Asylum. Whooping Cough 56 The whole District. Chicken Pox 19 Whetstone & North Ward Ringworm 1 Central Ward. Total 259 The notifications were received from the Schools as follows:— St. Paul's notified 54 cases. St. John's „ 76 St. Peter's „ 4 „ Sydney Rd., M.C.C. „ 109 „ Holly Park, M.C.C. „ 15 „ All Saints' „ 18 „ Garfield Road ,, 12 „ St. James' „ 1 „ Total cases notified 289 Midwives Act. The Act is administered by the County Authorities. The one case of Puerperal Fever was notified. In the first place the patient was attended by a midwife. Isolation Hospitals. The District, under an arrangement with the Southgate 14 District Council, has six beds for the treatment ot Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Enteric Fever. Provision has also this year been made for Smallpox. The District having made arrangements with the Middlesex Joint Smallpox Hospital Board. Infectious Diseases And Tub Means taken To Prevent Their Spread. On receipt of information respecting infections case the premises are visited, a printed list of instructions as to necessary precautions is given and explained, disinfectants are supplied, and the schools attended, in the case of children, and their employers in the case of adults, notified. Removal to an Isolation Hospital is offered, and when accepted is carried out, subject to beds being obtained. After recovery or removal ot an infectious case, disinfection of the room or rooms occupied is performed by means of sulphur and formalin. Cleansing and stripping notices are served where necessary. Clothes, bedding, &c., are removed to Finchley, where they are put through the steam disinfector. Diagnosis outfits and antitoxin are supplied free to medical men for use in cases occurring in the District, and the suspected specimens are examined and reported upon at the expense of the Council. Supplies of antitoxin are kept at the Council Chambers in the Central Ward, and at the residence of the Medical officer of Health in the North Ward and at that of the Sanitary Inspector in the South Ward. Medical men have availed themselues of this serum, both for acute cases and as a preventive. Housing. The house accommodation still meets the demand. Overcrowding. A few cases were dealt with under the nuisance clauses of the Public Health Act 1875. 15 Two representations were made under the Housing and town planning act, and closing orders were made and are still in force. Three houses which were unfit were put into proper repair without the necessity of making a closing order. Common Lodging Houses. There are not any. Movable Dwellings. The District has not been troubled by any. Canals. There are none in the District. Disposal of Sewage. Situation of the Works.— The Sewage Works are situated on the South side of the District (in Wood Green Parish), and within 100 yards of a small brook, into which the effluent flows. The crignal works were completed at the end of 1886, from designs furnished by Mr. Baldwin Latham, M.Inst C.E. and were executed under his direction. The working of the tanks and original filters has been altered and improved, and three Primary Contact Beds have been constructed, under the supervision of Mr. E. J. Reynolds. Assoc. M.Inst. C. E. The method of treatment is as follows The sewage, which enters the works by gravitation, is first passed through a revolving screen, after which a solution of Buxton lime equal to 4 grains per gallon is added, and the whole is thoroughly mixed. It then receives aluminoferric to the extent of 1 grain per gallon, and is again well mixed by passing through a salmon ladder; and in this condition it flows into settling tanks, of which there are five, four having a capacity of 70,000 gallons, and the fifth, which will hold 92,000 gallons. 16 The increased storage capacity of these tanks will enable the Works to deal much more efficiently with any sudden flow of sewage. These tanks are divided by concrete walls, on which is an open channel divided by sluice doors, so that either one, two, three, four, or five tanks can be worked at the same time or alternately, as required. The overflow from the tanks first passes out of the tanks into an open channel, then into the first Contact Bed, and through the filter or second Bacteria Beds into an effluent chamber, and thence into the brook referred to above. Floating outlet arms have now been fixed to all the settling tanks, A permanent carrier has been constructed between the old and the two new filters. The Engineer and Surveyor has had a portion of the laud used for sludge disposal laid on in lagoons, and the sludge is run into these in turn, forming a fair mould on what was originally stiff clay and enabling the land to be turned into allotments. Samples of sewage effluent have been taken from time to time by the M.C.C. and the Lea Conservancy, the control samples of which have been analysed by Professor Kenwood with most satisfactory results. I would advocate that the planting of trees round these Works should be continued as suggested by the Engineer and Surveyor. The roads in this District have separate sewers for storm water, and all houses except the older ones have the dual system of drainage. An endeavour is being made to carry the storm water from the old houses into the surface water sewers, as opportunities occur. This is very necessary, as everything should be done to make the flow of sewage at any sewage works as uniform as possible. The sewage from the Avenue and Ely Place section of 17 the District has to he pumped to the Sewage Works, and in this case any rain water admitted to the sewers greatly increases the cost of lifting the sewage to the gravitation sewers. During 1910 new sewers have been laid in Oakleigh Road North, Bawtry Road, Alma Road Hilton Avenne, Petworth Road (White House Estate), and a new main sewer from the bottom of Torrington Grove westward into Hilton Avenue. Water Supply. The Barnet Water Company now gives a constant supply. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. A list of these will be found under the Scheme at the end of the Report. These have been constantly inspected, and suggestions for the personal cleanliness of the milkers and the grooming of the cows have again been urged. Veterinary surgeon has not yet been appointed. On complaint one sample of milk has been taken and subjected to bacteriological examination "The sample was unusually free from dirt" and outside contamination, but it contained inflammatory germs (steptococci, staphylococci pneumococci) iu large numbers and a few pus cells. The owner of the cows produced Veterinary Certificates showing that all his cows were in a satisfactory condition and good health. There was some doubt of the exact source of the milk supply from whence the sample was taken, and the matter could not be satisfactorily cleared up. One sample of milk was taken as an informal sample by the Sanitary Inspector, and submitted through the County Inspector to the Publie Analyst tor analysis. He reported the sample "not adulterated." 18 Slaughter Houses. There were two in the District. One has been adapted to other purposes. Meat and Food Inspection. The Sanitary Inspector has given this matter particular attention, and the butchers' shops and general food vendors' premises are under periodical inspection. The meat sold in the District is chiefly derived from the Meat Markets of Loudon, and show signs of having been previously inspected. This is especially so with regard to pork, a large quantity of which comes from Holland. All locally killed pork is inspected on exposure for sale, and the glands of the neck and throat are incised and examined. In June the Sanitary Inspector's attention was directed to the fact that unsound food had been sold. A seizure was made and proceedings taken, with the result that a conviction was obtained. Fifty large mackerel (weight about about 40 lbs.) were brought to the Council Offices for examination before exposing them for sale. They were found to be in the early stages of decomposition, especially along the bones. They were surrendered and burnt at the Sewage Works. Pig Keeping It does not seem possible to convince the ordinary pigkeeper that the pig is really a clean animal in his habits, the opinion prevails, it would almost seem, that the dirtier the surroundings and the more decomposed his food the more he likes it and the better he thrives. The result of such erroneous ideas is that Piggeries are almost always carried on in such a manner as to be bordering on if not actually a nuisance. With the rapid extension 19 of building the difficulties surrounding this industry have largely increased. The Authority has received so many complaints that it becomes necessary to look for some means of mitigating the trouble, namely, whether Pig Keeping should or should not be considered an offensive trade under the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. Offensive Trades. There are not any. Dust Disposal and Removal. This is undertaken by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. The collection is made weekly, and the dust removed in covered vans. Notices are served as required to provide portable sanitary dust-bins in place of worn-out or insanitary bins. The refuse is chiefly taken to the Sewage Works and deposited on the ground. The Engineer and Surveyor had brought the matter of the provision of an up-to-date Dust Destructor again before the Council, and preliminary schemes and estimates have been obtained, and the Committee have the matter in hand. ambulance. This District does not yet possess an Ambulence. But satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Finchley District Council for the hire of their conveyance. Mortuary. The Finchley District Council have an excellent Mortuary a short distance from Friern Barnet s West boundary, and arrangements have been made for its use. Coronor’s Inquests. The large room on the West side of the Council Offices has been fitted up for Coroner's Inquests, and during the 20 year a number of Finchley and Friern Barnet Inquests have been held here. The Council Offices being near the Finchley Mortuary, this room has been found convenient tor holding the Finchley Inquests. Formerly the Inquests were held at public-houses. Legislation.

The card form was discontinued early in the year, and a letter card that could be sealed was substituted. During the year the notifications under the Act have greatly increased. There are four midwives pradicing iu the District, only one of these is a resident in the District. The midwives are very prompt in sending notifications of births, nearly 50 per ceut of the notifications come from them. Lists of the births notified where the mother is attended by a midwife have been periodically supplied to the Chief Inspector under the Midwives Act. ou forms supplied by the County Medical Officer of Health. The services of the voluntary helpers has not been asked tor. Great Northern Railway Bridge, Friern Barnet Rd. The Agreement for widening this dangerous bridge, which is to be paid for by the Middlesex County Council aud this Council, are practically completed, aud it is hoped to commence the work shortly. 23 Public Improvements. Patent Victoria Stone has been laid in the Friern Barnet Road between Friern Lane and Kennard Road, and paving repairs have been carried out in many parts of the District. Arrangements are being made for further widenings by the Council Offices, Friern Lane, and Colney Hatch Lane. The Avenue Road has been extended into Oakleigh Road South, thus doing away with a most objectionable cul-de-sac and opening up a poor neighbourhood. The sanction of the Local Government Board has been applied for for a loan for paving works, etc. Oakleigh Road South.— A loan for Patent Victoria Stone Paving is being sought tor this widened footpath on the east side from Friein Barnet Road to the Boundary of the District by the Recreation Ground. New Roads.— The Owners of various estates have opened and constructed roads called Hilton Avenue and Pet worth Road. Private Street Works.— Bawtry Road, Alma Road' Torrington Park (western portion), Oakleigh Park North, at an expenditure of £y354. have been made up under the 150th Section of the public Health Act, 1875. The Council's Contractors are now at work making up Sutton Road and St. John's Avenue. Notices have been served to make up, etc,, Park View Crescent and Spencer Road. Alexandra Road.— This road is in a disgraceful condition and badly requires making up, and the Council are still endeavouring to come to an agreement with the Wood Green Council so that the road which lies in the two Districts may be made up jointly. Lighting.— Almost all the District has now automatic clockwork all-night incandescent lamps. With the great increase of motor traffic, adequate lighting of street crossings, ete.,is necessary tor the public safety. 24 Fire Brigade.—This retained Brigade has done useful work during the last year. No fires of any importance have occurred. Post Office Telegraphs.—Underground wires have been laid in Torrington Park and Oakleigh Park North. Vent Columns.—Additional vent columns, 37 ft. 6 in. high, have been fixed in many roads, both on old sewers and new estates. Dust Prevention.—Almost the whole of the roads were coated with Carbnrretted water gas tar in the summer of 1910, but the wet weather prevented a second coat being applied. An up-to-date Tar Spraying Machine has now been purchased by the Council. The Friary Park.—The Council's work of laying out this Park, laving tarpaved paths, surface water drains, levelling pitchs for tennis, cricket, and gymnastic appartus, forming lakes, planting shrubberies and borders, etc., fixing wrought iron entrance gates, repairing house for Park Superintendent, land draining, etc., was continued in 1910. The Park was to have been formally opened by the Lord Mayor, Sir John Knill, and the Sheriffs of London in state on Saturday. May 7th, but owing to the lamented death of His Most Gracious Majesty King Fdward VII., the ceremony was abandoned and the gates thrown open by the Council without any formality. The Middlsex County Council contributed nearly £2,000. Mr. Sydney Simmons. J.P., who was unanimously elected Chairman of the Friern Barnet Council in April lass, continues to take the greatest interest possible in the Park and the work there. He gave a special donation towards and personally supervised much of the rockery work, etc. Mr. H. J. Tubbs of Nether Court, Finchley, presented over 1,000 very valuable trees and shrubs to the Park, and Mr. J. Sweet, Mr. Frederick Baker, and other residents have presented plants, bulbs, etc. 25 The Executors of the late E. Homan, Esq.. J.P., whose land adjoins the Park on the west side, have given a strip of laud to straighten the boundary of the Park and provide room for a path that is necessary on the west side of the stream. The Council have had a new iron fence erected on this new boundary line. TheCouncil is applying for a further loan of £2,500 for continuing the work of laying out the Park. The Park is appreciated by the Residents in the District and many visitors come from neghbouring Districts, especially North Finchley. Inspections. I have inspected Oakleigh Road South, East Road.
