BARN 64 THE ANNUAL REPORT of the SANITARY CONDITION of the Urban District of Barnes FOR THE YEAR 1897, by the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, JAMES ADAMS, M.D. r.w. simpson & co., limited, printers, barnes, richmond, and twickenham. 1898. THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE Urban district of Barnes FOR THE YEAR 1897, BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, JAMES ADAMS, M.D. R. W. SIMPSON & CO., LIMITED, PRINTERS, BARNES, RICHMOND, AND TWICKENHAM. 1898. TO THE Urban District Council of Barnes. Jamuary, 1898. Gentlemen, I have again to present to you what I believe you will consider a satisfactory Report of the Sanitary Condition of the District. I have made the usual house to house inspections of the district, sometimes in company with the Inspector; they have been made principally in localities where sickness has been prevalent, or when there has been reason to believe that Sanitary defects have existed. The alteration to the drainage of the Thorne Estate in the Westfields has been completed in a satisfactory manner. The Dust Removal has been effected in a way that leaves no room for improvement in a sanitary point of view. Most of the Private Roads which were in an unwholesome condition have been properly made up and adopted. Altogether steady advance has been made in the sanitary condition generally. There are some defects which will have to be remedied, especially in Mortlake, where—by some oversight—the house drains were not re-laid and properly disconnected and ventilated at the time the new sewers were laid; this is now being done, but it can only be effected gradually. The New Sewerage system has done much in improving the health and comfort of the 4 tants, but the benefit is in a mesure neutralized by the defects in the house drains, but this will undoubtedly be corrected. The district has been subject to occasional outbreaks of infectious sickness in different localities, almost amounting in one or two instances to epidemics. Whooping Cough has been prevalent in most parts of the district; there were' six deaths, four in Mortlake and two in Barnes. Measles during the last two months was general in Mortlake, but not very severe in character. There were also some cases in other parts of the district, but scattered and of a mild type. There was only one death which occurred in Mortlake. There were some cases of Typhoid, but only one death. There were fewer cases of Scarlet Fever during the early part of the year than we have had for some time, but there was a great increase in the number during the last four months; the same was the case with respect to Diphtheria. The larger number of the recent cases of both diseases were of people residing near Hammersmith Bridge, and almost all affected either attended school or had business connections on the Middlesex side of the river. Thirty-two of the 79 cases of the two diseases notified for Barnes resided in the part of the parish adjoining Hammersmith Bridge. There was nothing in the sanitary arrangements of the locality to account for it, but both Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria have been very prevalent in Hammersmith during the past few months. Only one case of Scarlet Fever was notified for Mortlake during the year; this is remarkable, as the surrounding parishes suffered considerably. The 13 cases admitted to the Hospital from the Richmond added area were from the portion which formerly formed part of Mortlake. Forty-four cases of Diphtheria were notified for the district, 20 of which were for Mortlake, which is rather an excess in proportion to population. There were four deaths, two for Mortlake and two for Barnes. There were 12 deaths from Diarrhcea, n infantile and one in an adult, with complications; six of the deaths were in Mortlake and six in Barnes. 5 Twenty-three deaths occurred from Lung Disease other than Phthisis, 12 in children under five years of age, and 11 over five years. There were 15 deaths from Phthisis, nine in Mortlake and six in Barnes, which is one more than last year, but considerably below the average of former years. There were only two deaths registered as directly due to Influenza. I have, in company with the Inspector of Nuisances, inspected the Cow Sheds, Dairies, Bake-houses and Slaughterhouses. The Cow Sheds are well constructed and kept in good order, with one exception, the owners of which have received notice to alter the arrangements. The Bake-houses as a rule are kept in good condition and clean, but those which are underground are not generally very satisfactory. Very few Slaughter-houses are in use in the district, and they are in very good condition and well kept. The water from four wells was found on analysis to be unfit for domestic use, and were closed, and a pure supply substituted. One hundred and ten cases of infectious sickness were notified, 31 for Mortlake and 79 for Barnes; this is the smallest number notified since the adoption of the Act in 1890. TABLE I. Mortlake.

There were comparitively few admitted during the spring and early part of the summer, but we became over full in August, when we had a 6 case of Typhoid which occupied one of our four wards, some cases of Diphtheria in another, and 15 cases of Scarlet Fever in the other two, which were built for the reception of five. This is a repetition of what took place last year. We have since up to the end of the year had from 17 to 24 in wards built for 10 patients. It is very necessary that the Convalescent Wards be proceeded with: it is very unsatisfactory to be obliged to crowd infectious sickness in confined space; it interferes with the progress of recovery, and we are obliged to refuse admission to urgent cases. I am pleased to be able to say that since writing the above the sanction of the Local Government Board has been received to proceed with the work, and that the Surveyor has received instructions to advertise for tenders for the construction of the building. Seventy-nine were admitted to the Hospital, 47 of Scarlet Fever, 28 of Diphtheria, and four of Typhoid. TABLE II. Mortlake. Barnes. Area. Total. Scarlet Fever 1 33 13 47 Diphtheria 10 18 — 28 Typhoid — 4 — 4 Total 11 55 13 79 There was little increase in the population up to the middle of the year, notwithstanding the extensive building operations in progress; there were not many completed ready for occupation, and few of them let. The estimate of the population for the district to the middle of the year is 16,950, and the deaths registered to the end of December, 196, which gives a death-rate of 11.56, but the deaths of five people who belonged to the district and died elsewhere have to be added, and the deaths of 16 people who were registered in the district but did not belong to it have to be deducted, which 7 reduces the number to 185 and the death-rate to 10.91. This is the fourth year in succession of low mortality, which is very gratifying as a proof of steady sanitary improvement. Ninety-eight deaths were registered for Mortlake which, with an estimated population of 7,350, gives a death-rate of 13.3 per 1,000. The same number of death (98) were registered for Barnes. This, with an estimated population of 9,600, gives a death-rate of 10 per 1,000. The deaths of 54 children under one year of age were registered, which is equal to a rate of 3.18 per 1,000. The deaths of 38 people over 65 years were registered, which gives a rate of 2.2 per 1,000. Three hundred and seventy births were registered, 218 for Barnes and 152 for Mortlake; this gives a birth-rate of 21.8 per 1,000. There were 35 inquests, 24 of which were registered for Barnes and 11 for Mortlake; 16 of these were of strangers, mostly bodies found in the river and brought ashore in the district.
