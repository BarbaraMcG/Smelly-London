This is the smallest birth-rate ever recorded in our Parish, the rate being even below that of the previous year. I now give in tabular form the birth-rates for the last twentyone years, with certain statistical details arising therefrom. 6 Table No. III.

The death-rate of Islington during the past year has been 16.0 per 1,000 of the population. There has been a total of 5,400 deaths recorded in the Parish, of which 2,706 were males, and 2,694 females. Of the 5,400 total deaths registered in Islington, 1,658 occurred in Upper Holloway, 1,884 in Islington South West, 1,044 in Islington South East, and 814 in Highbury. The actual number of deaths this year is rather more than the total number of the previous year, but taking the increase of the population into account, the death-rate of 16 0 per 1,000 is really the lowest to be found on our Islington records, and it is a fact again worthy of remark that this exceptionally low death-rate once more occurs in conjunction with an exceptionally low birth-rate. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. In the following table I have arranged according to age the deaths that have taken place in Islington from the year 1883 to 1887, inclusive:— 1883. 1884. 1885. 1886. 1887.

The deaths referred to the principal Zymotic diseases (exclusive of Diarrhœa) during 1887, viz.:—687 were considerably in excess of the previous year owing chiefly to the large increase in the deaths from Measles, which from 64 in 1886, rose to 331 in 1887. No death from Small-Pox occurred in the Parish during the year, the two deaths tabulated as such, in accordance with the practice of the Registrar General, being due to Varicella, or Chicken-Pox. The deaths from Measles reached 331, the highest number on record in Islington, and those from Whooping Cough, 238, were again very high. The number of deaths due to diseases of the Respiratory Organs was nearly as great as in the previous year, the fatal cases numbering 1,169, as against 1,201 in 1886, 1,197 in 1885 and 978 in 1884, but the deaths from these diseases, unless in very exceptionally severe seasons, more nearly keep pace with the increase of the population than those caused by other diseases. The fatality from Diarrhœa was also large, 291 deaths having occurred, as against 307 in 1886. SMALL POX. Another year has past of exemption from a visitation of Small-Pox, the two deaths in Islington tabulated as such having been really due, as I have already stated, to Varicella. Last year I sounded a note of warning against a fancied security from an invasion of this disease, and I will therefore here only repeat, that good primary vaccination and re-vaccination, with continuous vigilance, are the only means of guarding against such a calamity. MEASLES. Measles was severely epidemic during the year, more especially in the months of March, April, May, June and July, the deaths in the 10 twelve months having risen, from 64 in the previous year, to 331, the fatality during the months named having reached 286. The deaths from this disease during the eight preceding years were 64 in 1886, 289, 125, 165, 153, 161, 48 and 219 in 1879. Measles was, as I had anticipated, the most active and fatal epidemic of the year. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough was again next to Measles, the most severely epidemic and the most fatal of the Zymotic diseases, it having occasioned 238 deaths, as against 205 in 1886, and 200, 268, 119, 299 and 172 in the five previous years. The greatest fatality occurred during the last nine months of the year. DIARRHŒA. To Diarrhœa 291 deaths were attributable, as against 307 in 1886, and 191, 266, 162, 149, 216 and 295 in the six previous years. The deaths during the months of July and August were 239, or 82 per cent. of the whole mortality. FEVER. The deaths referred to Fever generally amounted only to 39, as against 48 in 1886, and 55, 83, 86, 77 and 79 in the five previous years. DIPHTHERIA. Diphtheria occasioned only 27 deaths, or just one half the number, viz:—54 which occurred in 1886, as against 138, 114, 70, 54 and 42 in the five previous years. The prevalence of Scarlatina in its turn during 1887 has again apparently lessened the number of the deaths referred to Diphtheria, 11 SCARLET FEVER EPIDEMIC. Scarlet Fever which may be said to have been singularly absent from us for the three previous years at least, became epidemic during the year under review, and a table of the cases recorded monthly in the Sanitary Department, together with the deaths referable thereto, will be found further on. Judging from the proportionate number of deaths, the disease has been throughout of an exceptionally mild and comparatively nonfatal character. The Metropolitan Asylums Board having their Hospitals nearly empty, made every sensational effort to create alarm, in order to secure the removal to their care of every person attacked, even of Infants who should certainly be allowed to remain in the care of their mothers. The table I have prepared, showing the ages of those removed to Hospital, may from this point of view be found interesting, as from it will be seen that no less than 68 infants and children under the asre of five years, and 109 children between the ages of five and ten years, were removed to the Board's Hospitals from this Parish alone. I must say that I strongly deprecate the forced removal of very young children to Hospital when suffering from such a disease as Scarlet Fever, nor do I think this course either wise or expedient, for if we live long enough, we shall all, sooner or later, with few exceptions, be sure to have it and perhaps at an age when it will be less convenient and more dangerous to suffer from it, and it may therefore be safely asserted that the rigid practice of isolation and of removal to Hospital may be carried too far. It is indeed a subject of surprise that a larger number of adults should not have been attacked during this epidemic, although there were in all no less than 75 persons attacked above the age of fifteen. I have also stated in Tabular form the number of cases occurring in each ward of the Parish during the year. 12 Table of 588 cases of Scarlet Fever recorded monthly, and 63 Deaths as occurring in Islington from the 3rd January, 1887, to the 31st December, 1887. 1887.

Remained at Home, 306. TOTAL, 588. The total number of cases recorded was 588, with 63 deaths, or a fatality of 10.7 per cent. amongst the cases recorded. 282 patients were removed to Hospital. Of these 13 only died, or 4.6 per cent., the per centage in this case being of course an absolutely ascertained proportionate quantity. 13 306 patients were recorded as having been treated at their own homes. Of these, 50 died, or 163 per cent., but this per centage it will be seen can bear no fair proportion to the number of persons actually attacked, as there were no doubt a much larger number of private cases of sickness, which never came to our knowledge at all, although we hear of all the deaths from the Registrars.

During the twelve months ending December, 1887, I examined 112 samples of food, all of which were submitted by your Inspectors, no samples having been submitted to me by the Public. This makes in all 1,688 samples of food examined for Islington since my appointment. The 112 samples submitted by your Inspectors consisted of:— 4 Mustard. 4 Black Tea. 4 Lard. 4 Cheese. 4 Flour. 4 Pickles. 4 Arrowroot. 8 Butter. 4 Milk. 4 Porter. 4 Port Wine. 4 Coffee. 4 Cocoa. 4 Whisky. 4 Chicory. 4 Rum. 4 Oatmeal. 4 Brandy. 3 Green Tea. 4 Moist Sugar. 4 Bread. 4 Sweets. 4 Gin. 4 Bitter Ale. 4 Black Pepper. 4 Cayenne Pepper. 4 Lime Juice. 1 Jam. Of the 112 samples submitted to me for examination I found none of them adulterated or containing any injurious admixtures. 1 have again, in an Appendix attached hereto, published, in extenso, for the information of the Vestry, my Reports as Analyst, together with their accompanying Schedules, and for further details I refer the reader to these reports. As I shall not again have to report as Public Analyst, I think it right to mention here that, owing to the passing of the Margarine Act, 1887, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1888, the Sanitary Committee expressed their desire that a much larger number of samples of Food, &c., should be analysed in future than had formerly been done. Under these circumstances I felt that I could not, with my responsibilities and duties as Medical Officer of Health to this vast Parish with such an enormously growing population, accept any further work in this direction, even with additional remuneration 18 as was suggested, and I therefore placed my resignation as Public Analyst, with the full concurrence of the Committee, in the hands of the Vestry, who have since very wisely in my opinion, appointed a Public Analyst upon such terms as will enable the Committee, or the Vestry, to have as much analytical work done as they may desire from time to time by paying for it, at the rate agreed upon for each additional sample. THE MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT, 1887. From the 1st January to the 31st December, 1887, 635 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being 1.7. 338 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £52 10s. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was about 6.2 per cent. for the whole year. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1887-88. Table No. VI. This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the Inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion the amendments effected. In addition, the Inspectors generally have also reported the premises from which they have found removal of dust to be necessary on making their ordinary inspections. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, Carbolic Acid was again used during the summer months in watering some of the streets. Disinfecting Powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway Roads, where these thoroughfares are used as market-places until late on Saturday night. The Dust Bins were also disinfected by the 19 Dustmen after removing the Dust from the houses of the inhabitants during the hottest months. A new departure has been taken during the year in respect to the fumigation of infected rooms, the Sanitary Committee deeming it desirable to accept a part of the responsibility on behalf of the Vestry. An extra Labourer is therefore employed, who now fumigates the infected rooms with Sulphur as soon after the information is received at the Office as possible. The plan has worked well and prevents delay in the carrying out of the most urgent part of the disinfection, and it also removes the objection, so frequently urged previously by the Owners of property, who have hitherto been chiefly called upon to do the work, to sending in workmen who do not generally like to enter before the fumigation has at least been done. THE SLAUGHTER AND COW-HOUSES IN ISLINGTON, 1887-88. At the Annual Licensing of 1887 there were 76 applications for the renewal of licenses to Slaughter-houses, and the whole of them were granted. For the renewal of licenses to Cow-houses, 36 applications were made and the whole were granted. 76 Slaughter-houses and 36 Cow-houses were therefore licensed. My annual inspection of these places, prior to the licensing, proved them to be in a satisfactory condition. DWELLINGS OF THE POOR. Of the 76 houses closed as unfit for human habitation in 1884, by order of the Magistrate, seven in Elliott's Place only remain shut. Attempts have been made from time to time by repairing, &c., to make these houses habitable, but unless the owner carries out considerable structural alterations, which he appears unwilling to do, it will be impossible to effect any permanent improvement in the Sanitary condition of these houses, so as to render them again fit for habitation 20 by any respectable class of persons, that being the greatest difficulty in connection with all such properties. REGISTRATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS, OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. (29 & 30 Vic., cap. 90, sec. 35, & 37 & 38 Vic., cap. 89, sec. 47.) During the year the Vestry, on the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, added 88 Houses to the Register under the Regulations made with respect to Houses let in Lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, so that up to the 25th March, 1888, 327 houses had been placed upon the Register. THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH 1887-88. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated statement (Table No. VII.) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady-day, 1888, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 9,284 received from residents during the year, 6,202 were by Letter or Postal Card, and 3,082 were made personally, or by messengers sent to the Vestry Offices. The 9,284 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 22.2 per cent. of the 41,658 assessments in the Parish as against 27.5 per cent. in 1886. This decreased per centage in the year shows a marked improvement in itself, but it is still more promising when the per centages of the two last quarters of each year are contrasted, 1887 showing only 5.5 per cent., as against 14.5 per cent. in 1886. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, M.B., Medical Officer of Health. 30th June, 1888. TABLE No. V.
