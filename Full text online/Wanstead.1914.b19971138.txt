WANS 32 Wanstead Urban District Council. ANNUAL REPORT of MEDICAL OFFICER to which is appended a report of the SANITARY INSPECTOR. 1914. To the Chairman and, Members of The Wanstead Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report for the year 1914, to which is appended a Report of the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. H. C. Howard, which deals with the matters appertaining to his Department. Much has happened since the writing of my last Report, but it is indeed gratifying to note that, in spite of the exceptional conditions of the past seven months, a very healthy tone exists in this locality. Many Refugees are now in our midst, and although some were landed from a steamer where a case of small-pox existed, happily none contracted the disease. They were under my supervision for the quarantine period of about a fortnight. For the convenience of the Local Government Board, and those not acquainted with the district I again repeat the following description of the physical features and general characteristics. The Urban District of Wanstead is situated within the N.E. section of the London area, and is bounded on the N. by Woodford, on the B. by Ilford, on the S. by East Ham, and on the W. by Leyton. Snaresbrook is but a subdivision of Wanstead Parish, and is situated on the W. side of the Railway Arch, towards the Infant Orphan Asylum. The District can be best described as a parallelogram of 1,679 acres, extending 2| miles North and South along the West side of the River Roding, and having an average width of little over a mile. It has a general slope from N.W. to S.E., the highest point (170 feet above Ordnance datum) being the extreme N.W. corner of the district, and the lowest point (20 feet above Ordnance datum) at the extreme S.E. corner of the district, on the flood lands attached to the Council's Sewage Farm. The subsoil is mainly gravel, intersected with layers of clay, whilst the higher levels of the district are of clay formation. 4 Tracts of forest land and water, including what are commonly known as Wanstead Park and Wanstead Flats, and comprising in all about 509 acres, abound in the southern portion of the district. These permanent open spaces, being secured against the future inroads of the builder, will doubtless preserve to a large extent the present residential character of the district. The population is fairly distributed north and south, and the central part contains practically the whole of the cottage, shop, and business premises. Here the population is more compact. When the Census was taken in April, 1911, the population, excluding 895 in the Orphanages and about 250 at the Aldersbrook Cottage Homes, worked out at 4'52 per house, whereas prior to that it was 5. In 1914, the number of inmates at the Orphanages, the Aldersbrook and Cottage Homes totalled 1,257. This number, therefore, has to be deducted in calculating the birth rate. The number of inhabited houses at Midsummer, 1914 was 3,344 The number of uninhabited houses at Midsummer was 202 The number of inhabited houses at Christmas was 3,464 The number of uninhabited houses at Christmas was 185 The number of new houses passed in the year was 96 The estimated population at the middle of the year was 16,671. DEATH RATE.—The number registered here was 107 minus 4 aliens, plus 38 residents who died elsewhere. For the latter information I am indebted to the County Medical Officer. The corrected death rate, therefore, was 8.45 per 1,000. BIRTH RATE:—The total number of births registered was 216; to this must be added 2 born outside the Parish. The corrected number, therefore, was 218, viz., 114 boys and 104 girls; 1 was illegitimate. The birth rate wasl4.14. INFANT MORTALITY.—There were 10 deaths under 1 year. Two of these were premature. The rate per 1,000 net births was 45.8 as compared with 61.7 in 1913. My Council does not consider it necessary to adopt the Notification of Births Act. 5 SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL—The drainage and sewerage of the district is effected by gravitation, the sewage outfall being at the lowest corner, and adjacent to the Boding, into which the effluent flows. The roads have separate storm water sewers, which terminate at various points of discharge into the Eoding. In spite of the unprecedentedly wet winter and the high floods which frequently prevailed in the Roding valley, I am glad to report that not one single case has been notified of damage or inconvenience caused by overcharged sewers. The completion of the new Works at the Sewage Farm has been somewhat delayed by various unforeseen improvements and extensions, such as the construction of entirely new detritus tanks with electrically driven screening appliances. Payments of upwards of £11,000 have been made to the Contractors, and the greater part of the new plant is now in successful operation. In my next Beport I hope to give a full description of the completed scheme, which will doubtless provide the most efficient example of this branch of engineering in the Home Counties. DEVELOPMENTS.—During the past twelve months 96 houses were passed for occupation, the buildings being chiefly of a middle class type ; these were mostly built in the first half of the year. As in other districts, the work of estate development and the enterprise of the speculative builder has been severely checked by the war; despite these adverse circumstances, however, plans for the erection of 105 new houses were sanctioned by the Council. ROADS.—During the year a grant of £45,000 was allowed conditionally by the Boad Board, through County channels, for the purpose of main road reconstruction. Advantage was immediately taken of this offer, and at the close of the year the whole of that portion of Hermon Hill, from the High Street to Eagle Lane was practically reconstructed with wood block paving set on reinforced concrete, whilst similar operations were in progress in the High Street and Blake Hall Boad. Much importance was naturally attached to this state-aided development, in consequence of the destruction of the roads by motor traffic. The scheme of the Boad Board was to spread the grant over a three years' basis, but owing to unforeseen circumstances it is probable that further progress will be delayed. 6 Table A.—ZYMOTIC DISEASE.—Vide Table B. The following Zymotic Diseases were notified. Small Pox | Diphtheria Scarlet Fever Erysipelas Varicella Enteric Fever Totals Wanstead — 9 29 9 47 2 96 Infant Orphan Asylum — 3 — — 48 — 51 Aldersbrook and Cottage Homes — 3 3 2 — — 8 15 32 11 95 2 155 DIPHTHERIA antitoxin is always kept available for medical men in special cases, and swabs are submitted to the C.M.O. for a bacteriological report by arrangement with the M.O.H. The importance of taking early swabs in cases of suspicioi s Diphtheria cannot be over-estimated and no doubtful case should be removed to hospital before a positive swab has been taken. Five times last year I was asked to remove cases to hospital that were not diphtheria. On the other hand three cases were removed from one house at different dates in a short interval with diphtheria, and it was ascertained that another child had been suffering from a slight sore throat ten days before the first case was admitted. Upon my request a cultivation was taken of the first case and it was then found that this child also was suffering from diphtheria and had to be removed to hospital. Had the first case been recognised it would probably have ended there. Table B.—TUBERCULOSIS. The following notifications were received during the year;— Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations — 1912. — Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Other forms of Tuberculosis. Total number of notifications received. Primary Notifications Beceived 20 8 28 Dual Notifications 3 1 4 Total 23 9 32 7 Sputum is also submitted to the County Medical Officer for bacteriological examination in doubtful cases of Tuberculosis. SCAYENGING.—The removal of house refuse is carried out by contract, and a weekly collection is made throughout the District. With the termination of the present contract, the question as to the adaptability of more modern covers for dust carts will be considered by my Council. The collected matter is disposed of outside the District, and all complaints concerning this Department in reference to non-collection of house refuse, and to the non-provision of proper receptacles, are dealt with by the Sanitary Inspector. MOSQUITOES.—The prevalence of mosquitoes during recent years, particularly in the districts of the Epping Forest area, has induced the various authorities to adopt means for reducing the pests. During the summer, pamphlets containing printed instructions aimed at preventing the breeding of mosquitoes were distributed among the householders. The pests were commonly found among dwelling-houses, especially within the neighbourhood of drain inlets, accumulations of water and other damp surroundings. During winter swarms of mosquitoes are sometimes found in cellars and underground spaces. The owner of a large pond near one of the orphanages was prevailed upon to have it filled in. HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, etc, ACT, 1909.-Under the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910, thirty-five houses were specially inspected during the year, and with works in progress at other premises previously inspected, a total of fifty-three dwelling-houses were very thoroughly dealt with. The most notable improvement in this direction was in connection with the cottages known as East Row, New Wanstead. All available time has been given to this work by the Sanitary Inspector, apart from which a large number of premises were inspected and dealt with without reference to the Housing Act, 8 The following statement is also required in accordance with these Begulations:— Total number of dwelling-houses inspected during 1914 (under Section 17) 35 Number of houses found to be in a state dangerous or injurious to health (Section 17)14 Number of Closing Orders served by the Council (under Section 17) Nil Number of dwelling-houses rendered fit for habitation (Section 17), including those inspected during 1913 ... 26 Number of dwelling-houses closed voluntarily 1 Number of dwelling-houses in consideration or undergoing repair at the close of 1914 18 The number of working-class dwellings remains stationary ; local industries are, however, almost entirely confined to local needs, and the number of persons employed in factories and workshops within the district is relatively small. The population consists largely of those more or less dependent upon business or professional interests in the metropolis, to which may be added a number of retired middle-class residents. The minor proportion apparently is made up of local tradespeople, outdoor servants, including a good number of skilled artisans', various officials, and others employed among the industrial districts within more or less easy reach. SMALL POX.—The contract with Dagenham for the reception of any cases has been renewed. CHICKEN POX is still notifiable. THE WANSTEAD ISOLATION HOSPITAL contains 20 beds, viz.:—Scarlet Fever 12, Diphtheria 8. 29 cases were admitted during the year, viz.:—Scarlet Fever 17, Diphtheria 12. 3 cases of Scarlet Fever and 1 case of Diphtheria were from the West Ham Union Infirmary, also 2 of Diphtheria from the Scattered Homes at Woodford. There remained at the end of the year, Scarlet Fever 2, Diphtheria 5. THE PUBLIC MORTUARY, etc.—During the year nine bodies were deposited in the Mortuary, and nine inquests were held. 9 WORKSHOPS, FACTORIES, etc., is dealt with in the Report of the Sanitary Inspector. THE WATER was supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, which in large measure is pumped from the Lea Bridge pumping station; it was good and constant. The following Statistics (pages 10 to 15) show clearly in tabulated form:— (a) Table I. Births and deaths during the year 1914 in comparison with those for the years 1908 to 1913 inclusive.

Gentlemen, In accordance with the Regulations of the Local Government Board, I beg to submit my Third Annual Report on the work carried out in the Sanitary Department daring the year 1914. INSPECTION OP DISTRICT. The general expansion and speeding up of Public Health legislature during recent years, has greatly increased, both objectives for inspection, and the volume of work in consequence. The following particulars will indicate therefore the nature and results of the more important inspections undertaken. The number of inspections from all causes, was 650 The number of re-inspections due largely to the supervision of works required, etc1,870 The total number of visits was 2,520 COMPLAINTS. The complaints investigated and attended to during the year totalled 210; eighty of these were in reference to house-drainage and sewer ventilators, thirty-five were due to the non-removal of house refuse, and respecting a number of others, no action could be taken. Overcrowding was alleged to exist at ten houses, but of these, four cases were subsequently abated ; the remainder proved to be unfounded RE DRAINAGE. As indicated by the'following list of premises re-drained, a large proportion of the past year's work was necessarily involved in this important direction. The whole of this work was cherefore carried out under my personal supervision, and, before completion, the new drains were submitted to water and smoke tests. 18 The use of the double socketed variety of pipeware, which I bad strongly recommended was generally adopted by the builders. Owing to the position of the law relating to sewer and drain, the main drainage of five houses was reconstructed by the Council at the public expense. At the close of the year the Council had approved of a scheme for extending main drainage to the premises of Park Cottage and Nos. 1-4, Mornington Villas, Blake Hall Road, these premises having old and more or less obsolete systems of cesspool drainage. The following premises were either partially or entirely re-drained:— Addison Eoad—No. 73. Buckingham Eoad—Nos. 5, 6, Cowley Road—Nos. 14, 16, 18, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 72, 74. Chaucer Road — Nos. 2, 54. Cambridge Road—Nos. 30, 32. Camden Road—No. 1. Eagle Lane—" Wingfield." George Lane—Nos. 29 (Bakehouse) 31, 35. Grove Road—Nos. 7, 13, 32, High Street—No. 47. Hermon Hill—" Beechwood." Lansdowne Road—" Fernwood." Marlborough Road —Nos. 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28. Pulteney Road—Nos. 78, 80, 84, 86, 88. Spratt Hall Road—No. 17. Tavistock Road—Sydenham Lodge. Wellesley Road—Nos. 34, 36, 38, 40, 46. Woodford Road—" St. Heliers," "Woodbury.'' INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Under the direction of the Medical Officer, all cases of infectious disease, including tuberculosis, were investigated, and the necessary steps taken to prevent the spread of infection. On convalescence, or removal of patients to hospital, disinfection of premises, bedding, etc., was carried out, and any uncleanly conditions or sanitary defects were subsequently remedied. 19 Among the 73 premises concerned, 95 rooms and 48 loads of bedding were disinfected during the year, and various articles were destroyed on request; no complaint as to injury to bedding was received. The wards, rooms and bedding of the diphtheria block at the hospital were also disinfected in the anticipation of receiving wounded soldiers. Disinfection is carried out by the following means :— 1. Formalin gas (Alformant lamp). 2. Formalin spray, 3. Bedding, etc., is disinfected in the Council's steam disinfecting chamber, FOOD INSPECTION. The number of premises within the district concerned with the sale of food is about forty, and these are inspected with more or less frequency as occasion demands. There are two slaughter-houses, both large and wellconstructed premises, provided with excellent lairage accommodation for cattle. The occupiers of the latter hold licenses subject to annual renewal, and business has been well conducted at both premises. As far as possible all carcases are inspected during process of slaughter—the only opportunity for complete examination. Much of the meat consumed in the district is obtained from the London markets; local killed meat, however, is usually of prime quality, and of the 350 carcases examined, disease of any importance was rarely detected. The following articles were condemned and destroyed 2 ox lungs Tuberculosis. 1 ox liver and mesentery ,, 1 ox lung Echinococcus cysts (parasitic) 1 lamb's leg Gangrene. also one trunk of whiting, and a quantity of stale fat from fish fryers' pans. The only fish frying business carried on in the district, was for a short time conducted under exceedingly filthy conditions and attracted pests of flies. 20 Quantities of decomposing fish refuse, etc., were removed, the surfaces of shop floor, pans, etc., were scraped and scrubbed, and the premises were cleansed generally; this business was subsequently discontinued. HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, etc.. ACT, 1909. It is four years since the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations first came into operation, previous to which, little if any system of house inspection, had been carried out within the district. The results of more recent inspections have therefore shown a high percentage of bad defects or insanitary conditions. Of the 320 dwelling-houses visited during the past year, works were carried out at 250. Fifty-four premises were dealt with in connection with the Housing Record, of which thirty-three were newly inspected during 1914. For the purposes of the Housing Act few houses are exempt from inspection even though unoccupied ; the course of procedure, however, is governed by the results. The greater proportion are more appropriately dealt with under the Public Health Acts, without further reference to the Housing Regulations. Considerable structural alteration and repair works was carried out among the Cowley Road properties, and at Bast Row Cottages, New Wanstead. The serving of closing orders was avoided in every case. FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACT, 1901. The premises registered under this Act in the district are respectively factories (all places in which motive power is used) workshops and workplaces, the total of sixty such premises includes twelve which are designated as factories. There are four bakehouses, including one factory, two underground and another which was newly occupied during the latter part of the year. One of the latter premises was entirely re-drained, as well as the adjoining property from which the contents of a leaky drain had previously percolated through the walls of the bakehouse underground. The Bakehouse Regulations were duly observed. Five outworkers lists were received from other districts and each of the premises concerned was visited. 21 DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOP REGULATIONS, 1899. There were three registered cowkeepers and eight dairymen carrying on business in the district during the year. Although very old buildings, the cowsheds have been kept in good condition, and the cattle were usually turned out to graze during day time The total number of cows housed in the sheds did not exceed thirty. The dairies and milk stores were also found to be kept in satisfactory condition. No application for registration was received during the year. PETROLEUM ACTS. Although a number of premises are concerned with the sale, storage or use of petroleum and its by-products, these are mostly exempt from license. Licenses for the storage of petroleum are necessary only when kept for sale, and with certain exemptions as to small specified quantities sold in bottles. Six premises were licensed for the sale of petrol, and in one instance with the addition of benzoline ; one store is an isolated brick building, the remainder consist of iron tanks sunk in the ground ; one store was found unsatisfactory owing to limited accommodation, and the business has since been given up. NOTICES etc., SERVED, The number of Statutory Notices served under the Public Health Acts during the year was—. 14 The number of informal notices, including specifications of dilapidations and requirements in reference to the Housing Regulations 137 The various communications issued from the office during the year amounted to 350.
