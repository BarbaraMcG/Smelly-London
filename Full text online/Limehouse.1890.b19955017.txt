MORTUARY. The question of the general condition of the Board s Mortuary in Little John Street, RatclifT, having been brought under the Notice of the Board, the matter was referred to the Works Committee for consideration. The Committee, having viewed the Mortuary, made certain recommendations, and the necessary works have been carried out. BOARD'S OFFICES. Most of the rooms required repairs and decoration, nothing having been done to them for over 12 years. The Board ordered certain of the rooms to be decorated, which work was carried out satisfactorily by the contractors. IMPROVEMENTS. THREE COLT STREET. On the 16th June at a Special Meeting called pursuant to requisition a petition was presented signed by 150 residents in Limehouse requesting the Board to take steps to carry out the scheme to widen Throe Colt Street according to the plans submitted by the Board to the London County Council and referred to in my last Annual Report (Improvement No. ft), either as a County or Local Improvement. The Hoard resolved "That this Hoard "considering the urgent need of widening Three Colt Street in "accordance with the plans submitted to the County Council is "prepared to pay a moiety of the the total cost of carrying out the "same, and that Messrs. Ambrose and Leon be requested to urge "the Council to contribute the other half of the coat of the "said improvement" Subsequently a letter was receded from the County Council stating that if the Board was prepared under its powers to under take the widening to the extent of 40 feet of so much of the thoroughfare as lies within this District the Improvements Committee would take the question of a contribution by the Council into its consideration, provided that the Poplar District Board also agreed to widen the remaining portion of the thoroughfare lying within its District. The Board having considered such letter appointed a Deputation to wait upon the Improvements Committer to urge them to carry out the improvement of Three Colt Street as shewn upon the plan submitted by the Board and in accordance with the Resolution above mentioned. Such Deputation accordingly attended and explained the views of the Board, and a letter was afterwards received dated 23rd July stating that the Council was of opinion that the formation of a new street 40 feet wide from West India Dock Road (at Gun Lane) to Bridge Road was preferable to the widening of Three Colt Street and had accordingly decided to seek powers in the next session of Parliament to form such new street, subject to the Local Authorities within whose Districts it would be situated (the Limehouse and Poplar District Boards) agreeing to contribute one fourth of the net cost, which was estimated at £59,800, and asking whether the Board would be prepared on its part to contribute one eighth of the net cost. The Board resolved "That a reply bo "sent to the London County Council referring them to the proposed "scheme of the Board for the widening of Three Colt Street and "pointing out that in the judgment of the Board the proposed new "street to which the Board was asked to contribute would divert "business from and depreciate property in the Limehouse District, "and that the Board therefore refuse to contribute." On the 2lst January 1891 a letter was read from the Council to the effect that the Council was not prepared to widen Three Colt Street in the manner shewn upon the plan submitted by the Board and asking whether tho Hoard would be prepared to widen to 40 feet throughout so much of the whole thoroughfare (of which Three Colt Street forms part) from East India Dock Road to Bridge Road as lies within this District. No action was taken thereon. ISLE OF DOGS A letters was received from the London County Council dated 25th April stating that the Improvements Committee had under consideration the question of widening and improving the four bridges in the Isle of Dogs and the formation of a new thoroughfare from West India Dock Road to Bridge Road as shewn upon plans accompanying the letter and enquiring whether, in the event of the Council deciding to carry out these improvements the Board would be prepared to make a contribution towards the cost. The letter was referred to the Works Committee for consideration and upon their recommendation the Hoard declined to contribute towards tho cost of the suggested improvements. BEN JONSON ROAD. On the 30th April I reported that with Mr. Knight, the Surveyor of the Mile End Vestry, I had surveyed the various properties required for the carrying out of the Bon Jonson Road and Victory Bridge improvement and that wo estimated the cost thereof, allowing for recoupment at the sum of £9,000. Of this amount it was suggested that the London County Council should pay one half, the Vestry of Mile End one-fourth, and this Board the remaining fourth, viz. 43,260. This sum, if borrowed for 50 years, repayable by equal annual instalments with interest at tho rate of £3 17s. 6d. per cent per annum would have involved a charge of £132 3s. 9d. for the first year made up between the Parishes as follows:— Limehouse £57 Ratcliff 29 Shadwell 21 Wapping 25 If, however, the average interest wore taken for the 50 years I pointed out that the annual charge was equal to £88 11s. 10d. as follows:— Limehonse £33 Ratcliff 19 Shadwell 14 Wapping 17 On the 14th May, when the question was again under discussion, a Deputation attended and presented a petition, signed by some 600 persons, in favor of the improvements and addressed the Hoard in support thereof. A letter was read from the Clerk of the London County County Council as follows:— "The Improvements Committee has under consideration your "letter of the 9th October last on the subject of a proposed "improvement by widening the western end of Ben Jonson Road. "The Committee before determining upon its report to the Council "has directed me to enquire of the two local authorities concerned "the Limehouse District Board and the Vestry of Mile End Old "Town—whether in the event of the Council deciding to carry out "the Improvement they would each bo prepared to contribute half "the cost. I have accordingly to ask that you will bring the matter "before the Limehouse District Board, and inform me whether the "Board on its part is prepared to make a contribution of half the "cost." The Board having considered such letter resolved: "That "as it would be illegal for this Board to contribute towards the cost "of any works outside the District the County Council be urged to "carry out the proposed Ben Jonson Koad and Victory Bridge "Scheme as a County Improvement" On the 16th June, at a Special Meeting called pursuant to requisition it was moved that negotiations be entered into with the Mile End Vestry, with a view of accepting the offer of the County Council, and pledging the Board to contribute half the cost, but it was ruled that the motion could not be put, as the resolution of 14th May had not been rescinded. On tho 25th June, a Special Meeting was called pursuant to requisition when it was moved that tho resolution of 14th May be rescinded, but upon a division 11 members voted for the rescision and 9 against, and as the motion was not supported by a majority consisting of two-thirds of the members present, as required by the 18th and 19th Vic., cap. 120, sec. 57, the Chairman declared the same to be lost. Another Special Meeting was held on the 22nd July, when a motion to rescind the resolution of 14th May, was put and negatived. On the 5th November, a letter was road from the County Council, stating that the Council was of opinion that the widening of the west end of Ben Jonson Road was an improvement which, if effected, should be carried out by the local authorities as opportunity offered for acquiring the property on advantageous terms, and that should the local authorities be prepared at any time to take that course the Counril would consider favorably an application for a contribution towards the cost. On the 11th February, a Special Meeting of the Works Committee took place, when I submitted a plan for the Improvement shewing the widening to take place on the North side, and I reported that the cost of the acquisition of the various properties had been estimated by Mr. Knight, the Surveyor of Mile End, and myself at the sum of £4,000, and that the Vestry of Mile End had agreed to contribute one-fourth of the expense. The Committee decided to recommend that in conjunction with the Vestry of Mile End Old Town an application bo made to the London County Council to contribute one-half of the expense of the proposed Improvement in accordance with the plan I had prepared, and that in the event of the Council agreeing thereto arrangements be made with the Mile End Vestry for carrying out the Improvement Upon the recommendation being submitted to the Board, however, it was ruled that a motion for the adoption thereof could not be put as the beforementioned resolution of 14th May had not been rescinded, but a Special Meeting was held on the 4th March, and a motion for the revision thereof being then put and carried, the recommendation of the Committee was approved and adopted at the ordinary Meeting held subsequently on the same day. BROAD STREET. On the 8th October, the Works Committee reported that they had considered the reference to them by the Roard of the question of the formation of a new road from Dorset Street to Broad Street, and having made an inspection of the locality were of opinion that inasmuch as the suggested new road would take a considerable portion of the School Board for London premises and also valuable land belonging to Messrs. Holt & Co., it would be impossible to carry out the scheme, and that they had requested me to communicate with the School Board and Messrs. Holt & Co., upon the subject, so as to ascertain their views. The Committer also reported that they had inspected Collingwood Street, and that I had laid before them a plan showing a proposed widening of Collingwood Street, by setting back the houses on the West side so a to from a roadway sufficiently wide for two vehicles to pass at a time, and that they had requested me to make an estimate of the probable cost thereof. This road would form a direct thoroughfare from Commercial Road through Stepney Causoway, and Collingwood Street to Broad Street. On the 11th February, at a Special Meeting of the Works Committee, I submitted a plan of a proposed extension of Dorset Street to Brook Street, and the formation of a thoroughfare in continuation thereof from Cranford Street to Broad Street, and I informed the Committee that 1 had communicated with the School Board for London, and they had replied that they could not enter tain an application to dispose of any part of their site. This necessitated shifting the proposed new thoroughfare about 30 ft further to the East. I explained the details of the scheme, and stated that I estimated the coat of the acquisition of the various properties required at the sum of £8,300. The Committee at the same time considered the question of widening Broad Street from Schoolhouse Lane, as far as No. 83, Broad Street, a plan of which 1 submitted and the cost of which I estimated at £l5,000. After careful consideration the Committee resolved to recommend the Board to direct that a memorial and plan be sent to the London County Council, asking them to carry out the two schemes as a County Improvement, and that the Improvements Committee of the Council be asked to receive a Deputation from the Board for the purpose of fully discussing the facts and merits of the case. The Board approved and adopted such recommendation. COMMERCIAL ROAD, LIMEHOUSE. On the 18th February, a letter was read from the London County Council as to the proposed widening of Commercial Road at Limehouse, as shown on the plan sent to the Council on the 22nd January, 1890, and enquiring (1) whether a scheme for throwing part of the land on the South side of the road into the public way at an estimated cost of £2,000, as shewn upon the plan accompanying the letter, would meet the necessities of the case; (2) whether the Board would bo prepared to contribute towards the cost of the Improvement, and if so to what extent; and (3) whether the Board had ascertained if the North Metropolitan Tramways Company would be willing to contribute to the cost. The consideration of the matter was referred to the Works Committee, who, during the year dealt with in this Report, made no recommendation with regard thereto. NEW GRAVEL LANE, &c. On the 18th March, a letter was read from the London County Council as to the application by the Board, that the widening of New Gravel Lane and Wapping Wall, and the formation of a new Street from Wagner's Place to Star Street, might be undertaken by the Council, and stating that the Council was not prepared to entertain the suggested Improvement EMANATIONS FROM SEWERS. On the 16th April, complaint was made of the nuisance caused by the emanation of noxious effluvia from ventilating grates of the main sowers in the neighbourhood of Burdett Road, and a letter was addressed to the London County Council upon the subject, who replied that a ventilating pipe had recently been erected in Turner's Road, which would, it was believed, remedy the evil. At the same time, as directed by the Board, I wrote to the Council asking that the Patent ventilators which had been put up by the Metropolitan Board of Works at the Triangle, Commercial Road, Limehouse, and in Turner's Road, at the corner of Locksley Street, might be removed; and on the 11th June, I reported to the Board that the Engineer of the Council had replied that if the ventilators were abolished it would bo necessary to form surface ventilators at the spots referred to, unless permission could be obtained to place ventilating pipes at the sides of some of the premises in the locality. I further reported that I understood the County Council was about to adopt a system of deodorization similar to that pursued by the Metropolitan Board, and which had proved successful three years since. On the 25th June, I reported that the Council had erected a shed at the Triangle, for the purpose of carrying out a system of deodorization of the sewage, and I suggested that the Council should bo asked to put up a similar shed in Oak Lane, a course which had been adopted with success by the Metropolitan Board. I he Board accepted the suggestion and I wrote to the Council accordingly, hut the request was not complied with. On the same day (25th June), a letter from the Council was laid before the Board to the effect that directions had been given for a general inspection to be made of the air shafts, with a view of devising some means of remedying the cause of the complaints, and that meanwhile deodorants would be freely used. On the 10th September, I reported that the County Council had stopped up the sewer ventilator in Turner's Road, and carried a 6in. x 6in. pipe up the front of the house No. 50, Turner's Road, in lieu thereof; and on the 24th September, in consequence of complaints still being made, the Council was asked to put up another ventilating pipe in Turner's Road, opposite that already fixed. This request was repeated on the 5th November, and on the 18th March a letter was read from the Council, stating that two additional ventilators had been fixed, one in Turner's Road, and the other at the end of Burdett Road, and that it was believed that the evils complained of would thus be remedied. In the course of the year several letters of complaint were] received as to the intolerable nuisance caused by the escape of noxious gases from the ventilating grates, and copies thereof were forwarded to the County Council; and on the 8th October, the Medical Officer reported that the nuisance was "a serious state of "things for the inhabitants of the locality, and one which could not "but affect adversely their health," and it was resolved that a copy of such report should be furnished to the Council with a request that the subject matter thereof might receive attention. MAINTENANCE OF DISTURNPIKED ROADS. In my last Annual Report I referred to this subject, and stated that the Board had decided to inform the London County Council that in the opinion of the Board the sum offered by the Council towards the cost of maintenance of Main Roads in tho year 1889-00, namely £487, was inadequate, and that the Board therefore declined to accept it, and called upon the Council to undertake the repair and maintenance of the roads as from the 31st March, 1890. In reply to a communication embodying this resolution a letter was received from the Council dated 27th March, 1890, with copy Resolutions passed by the Council as follows:— (a) That the Council do adhere to the offer already made to pay the sum of £187 towards the cost of maintenance of Commercial Road East, East and West India Dock Roads, and Horsoferry Branch Road during the year 1889 90, and that the Limehouse District Board bo so informed. (b) That the Council in the case of Commercial Road East, East and West India Dock Roads, and Horseferry Branch Road (which roads have been disturnpiked since 31st December, 1870), do exercise the rights conferred upon it by the Local Government Act, 1888, sec. 11, (sub-section 4), by requiring the Limehouse District Hoard to undertake the maintenance, Ac., of the said roads in consideration of such annual payment by the Council for the cost of the undertaking as may be determined in the manner provided by the said subsection. As directed by the Board the Council was thereupon asked on what ground the sum of £487 only was offered, and why the question should not be submitted to arbitration, and in reply the Council stated that the amount mentioned was offered "because 'that was the amount agreed upon between the District Board and 'the Local Government Board as being a reasonable one and was 'paid by the Government in respect of each of the preceding two 'years, and the Council saw no reason why the same sum should 'not still be considered a reasonable contribution towards the cost 'of maintenance of the roads. With regard to the question why ???he subject should not be referred to arbitration it was stated that ???t was not for the Council to take the measures necessary for such ???efence. Upon receipt of this letter the opinion of Counsel was taken as ???o the position of the Board, which was to the eftect that the whole ???f the facts should be laid before the Local Government Board so ???s to get them to direct that the Council should pay to the Board ???he amount of the actual expenses incurred in maintaining the ???oads for the year 1889-90 instead of the £487 offered. Counsel was doubtful whether the Local Government Board had the power ???o do this for the year ending 31st March, 1890, but he thought the Roard could not be worse off by making the claimas the Council could hardly go away from their offer. The Board resolved to act upon the suggestion of Counsel and the Clerk accordingly sent to the Council a draft agreement for submission of the matter to the arbitration of the Local Government Board. A letter was received from the Council dated 30th October, 1890, with copy Resolution passed by the Council as follows:- "That the attention of the Limehouse District Board be called "to the provisions of sub-section 5 of section 11 of the Local "Government Act, and that it be informed that the Council is not "satisfied by the Report of its Engineer that Commercial Road "East, East and West India Dock Roads and Horseferry Branch "Road, have been properly maintained and repaired, and ran rot "therefore make any payment to the District Board towards the "cost of the maintenance and repair of the roads; that consequently "no question of amount has arisen for arbitration; but that if "the District Board should de ire that the question of the Council's "refusal to make a payment should be referred for the arbitration "of the Local Government Board the Council will join in a submission "to that Board upon that question as well as upon the question of "amount should the Board consider that the Council ought, in the "circumstances, to make a payment." The Board directed that a letter shoud be addressed to the Council asking in what respects the roads in question had not been properly maintained and repaired. On the 4th February, 1891, the Clerk of the Council wrote that the questions relative to the maintenance of the Finchley and Edgware Roads were to be submitted for arbitration, and suggesting that when the award of the arbitrator in that case became known it might be found unnecessary to incur the expense of arbitration in reference to other mads, as some arrangement might be come to on the basis of that award, a view in which the Board concurred. MAIN ROADS. A letter was received from the London County Council dated 21st May, 1891, referring to the request that certain thoroughfares in the District, mentioned in the note upon this subject in my last year's Report, might be declared to be main roads under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1888, sections 11 and 41 (4) and the Highways and Locomotives Act 1878, and stating that the Council was of opinion that there was not probable cause for such an application and therefore declined to accede to it. ARTIZANS’ AND LABOURERS' DWELLINCS ACTS. In continuation of the paragraph in my last Annual Report upon this subject I have to report as follows:— 55 & 57, BROOK STREET. The Board considered the reports of the Medical Officer and myself as to these houses, and Mr. Knight the Surveyor of the 'owner attended and stated their objections to the same, particularly to that part which alleged that tin- defects could not be remedied by structural alterations and improvements and that the houses ought to be demolished. Mr Knight said that in his opinion the premises could be made fit for habitation and that the owners were prepared to carry out such works as were necessary for the purpose, and the Board accordingly adjourned the matter until the next meeting and requested Mr. Knight to furnish a schedule of the works which the owners were ready to execute. At the adjourned consideration, the Board having resolved itself into Committee, I reported upon the plans and schedule of works submitted on behalf of the owners (a copy of which schedule had been sent to each member of the Board) and which it was urged would put the premises into a condition fit for habitation. I pointed out that certain defects referred to in the reports were not dealt with in the schedule, and Mr. Knight informed the Committee that the owners were willing to perform the works required for the purpose of remedying the name. Mr. Knight having retired, I stated that as the owners had expressed their willingness to carry out the works included in the schedule, I was of opinion that it would not be advisable for the Board to insist on the demolition of the premises, and possibly incur the serious expense of an appeal by the owners to the Court of Quarter Sessions and probably fail as the Court would consider the plans and schedule which had been submitted and not the original reports. As a result the following Resolution was passed:— "That the "Clerk be and he is hereby directed to draw up and submit to the "next Meeting of the Board an order upon the owners to execute "the several works included in the schedule submitted on their "In-half, and the additional works agreed to by Mr. Knight, and "added to such schedule." Such order was in due course approved by the Board and served upon the owners of the houses, who subsequently complied therewith. 61, BROOK STREET. The Board considered the reports of the Medical Officer and myself as to this house, and the owner attended and stated that he had no objection thereto. A resolution was therefore panned and an order served upon the owner requiring the demolition of the premises with which he complied. 4, ROPEMAKERS’ FIELDS. The Board considered the Reports of the Medical Officer and myself as to this house, and after some delay in consequence of the number of persons having interests in the property, an order was made for the premises to be demolished, and the same was subsequently complied with. SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS In consequence of a reference to the Works Committee as to the advisability of making alterations in the existing arrangements for carrying out the sanitary duties of the Board, 1 in conjunction with the Medical Officer of Health, made a report upon the subject as follows:— Gentlemen, We beg to report that we have given careful consideration to the subject referred to us, and we are of opinion that the District should be divided into three divisions, and that an inspector should be apponted for each. The three divisions we suggest are as follows:— (1) The part of the District from the Eastern boundary to extend westward up to and including the Regent's canal Dock Company's premises, and the Regent's Canal. (2) The part of the District extending westward from the boundary of No. 1 up to the centre of Stepney Causeway, thence passing southward to the centre of Collingwood Street, and the centre of Stone Stairs. (3) To include tho remaining portion of the District westward from the boundary of No. 2. This, if approved, will involve the appointment of an additional Inspector. Looking at the increased duties thrown upon the Board from time to time by the Legislature an regards sanitary matters, and the importance of a proper supervision, including a house to house visitation when required, we are strongly of opinion that the work is too great for two Inspectors. We also beg to report that we have considered the question of a proper record being kept of all inspections, so that the Board will be in possession of information as to the number made from time to time, the date when they were made, and the situation of each house. To carry this out, we suggest that the pages of the Inspectors books should be numbered, and that additional books should be provided in which the names of the various streets should be entered, the number of the house, and the date of every inspection ; and also to contain a reference to the Inspectors report books, so that the defects which were found, and the remedy applied for the removal of the same could be easily traced. As regards the removal of dust, wo beg to suggest that each Inspector should keen a record of tho pails delivered from time to time, the use made of them, and when the dust and refuse was taken away by tho contractors. At present we do not feel in a position to recommend a decided course, but would rather leave the matter until the arrangements before mentioned have been carried out, and greater experience obtained, when we shall be prepared to report to the Committee what further steps should bo taken with regard to the important question of the prompt removal of dust and refuse. Wo are also strongly of opinion that tho question of scavenging should not in any way bo mixed up, or form part of the duties of the Sanitary Inspectors, it will lead to confusion, and we consider that the scavenging staff should bo entirely distinct from the Sanitary Staff. We fool that it would be very inconvenient to divide roads running through the District into different sections, as it would prevent the cleansing and the removal of the slop being carried out continuously. CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. G. A. ROGERS, Mutual Officer of Health, The Committee adopted the Report and the Board, upon the recommendation of the Committee, directed that the suggestions contained therein should be carried out. SCAVENGING AND REPAIRS OF UNPAVED ROADS. In accordance with the directions of the Board I submitted a Report upon the question of what arrangements it was advisable to make with regard to the scavenging and the repairs of the unpaved roads in the District. The following is a copy of such Report:— Gentlemen, I have given careful consideration to the subject referred to me, and beg to report as follows:— (1) I am of opinion that the labour employed for Scavenging should be kept distinct from the labour employed in repairing unpaved Hauls. The latter work, 1 suggest, should in future bo superintended by the Clerk of Works instead of by the Superintendent of Cleansing and Watering as at present. This will relievo the Superintendent of a great deal of work, and the time saved he can devote to his proper duty, viz.:— the Cleansing and Watering. (2) I am strongly of opinion, that the existing arrangements for Cleansing and Watering, should bo continued under the same system which has hitherto been adopted, i.e., one Superintendent, one Ganger for each District, and the necessary men for performing the work. (3) As the District is large, the mileage of the streets being about 24 miles, it is almost impossible that the Superintendent can inspect all of them in the course of a clay, and I therefore suggest for the consideration of the Committee, that if he were provided with a pony and trap in times of bad weather, it would facilitate his work very much, and give him an opportunity of supervising the whole of the District in a more efficient manner than at present CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. The Board resolved to approve and adopt the suggestions contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Report, that contained in the third paragraph not being approved, ADVERTISING ON HOARDINGS. In July I prepared and submitted to the Board a Notice to Builders and others as to the provisions of the Advertising Stations (Rating) Act, 1889, together with Regulations pursuant to such Act. The Board approved the same, which are as follows:— BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Advertising Stations (Rating) Act, 1889. To Builders, Contractors and Others. Notice is Hereby given that by the Fifth Section of the above Act, the Board of Works for the Limehouse District, as the Authority for granting within its District a License for the temporary erection of any Hoard, Gantry, Scaffold, or other Structure, upon or over any part of any Public Highway, may include in such License a Condition or Conditions prohibing the affixing of any Advertisements to any such Hoard, Gantry, Scaffold, or other Structure, or sanctioning the affixing the Advertisements thereto, upon payment of such sum and on such conditions as the Board may determine.

DUSTING, &.C., ARRANGEMENTS. On the 18th February, a Special Committee was appointed to formulate and submit to the Board a scheme for the efficient removal of dust, slopping and watering. The Committee had not concluded its deliberations at the end of the period embraced in this Report STREET NOMENCLATURE. During the year the following orders were made by the London County Council with regard to street nomenclature:— For renaming New Street, Limehouse, "Phoebe Street," and renumbering the houses therein. For incorporating Henry Street, Limehouse, with Clemence Street, and renumbering the whole line of thoroughfare. For renaming Henry Street, Ratcliff, "Chasely Street," and for renumbering the houses therein.

For renaming Star Street, Shadwell, "Monza Street," For incorporating Anchor and Hope Alley and Broad Street, Wapping, with Red Lion Street, and for renumbering the whole line of thoroughfare. For renaming Palmer Street, Ratcliff, " Troon Street" For renumbering the houses in Wilson Street, Limehouse, and renaming the street "Matlock Street." The several new names have been painted up and in the cases of renumbering notices, were served upon the respective owners requiring them to paint or affix the new numbers. SNOW STORMS. In consequence of a fall of snow on the. 28th November, extra men were engaged for the purpose of assisting the regular men in clearing the thoroughfares, the cost of the extra labor being £7 14s 11d. Snow storms also took place on the 19th December and following days, and extra men were engaged, and some of the regular men worked overtime, the expense incurred being £52 1s. 8d. On the 10th March another fall of snow occurred, which necessitated the employment of extra labor for three days, at a coat of £15 17s. 10d." TRAMWAYS. After further negotiations with the Engineer of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company, the matter of duplicating the Tramway lines opposite Limehouse Church was brought before the Directors, and they determined to accept the arrangement mentioned in my last Report, and accordingly paid to the Board the agreed sum of £200, and proceeded with the work night and clay until completion. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Notice was received dated 28th June, 1890, from Messrs Deacon, Gibson A Medcalf, of 4, St. Maty Axe, Solicitors, for the London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited, of an intended application to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order under the Electric Lighting Acta, 1882 and 1888, to authorises the Company to supply electricity in various parte of the Metropolis, the proposed area of supply including the whole or some part of the Limehouse District. The application was not proceeded with. SUBWAY, CHURCH ROW. Application was made on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Abraham for permission to construct a subway from No. 1 to No. 2, Church Row, Limehouse, in connection with St Pelaga’s Home. The Works Committee inspected the locality, and the application was ultimately granted upon certain conditions, and subject to the payment of £1 per annum for the user of the subway. SUBWAY AND BRIDGES, NARROW STREET. An application was made by the Phœnix Wharves Company for permission to construct a subway under, and two iron bridges across Narrow Street to connect their premises on opposite sides of the street, as shewn upon the plan accompanying the application and the Board resolved to grant the same upon certain terms and subject to the payment of a nominal rent of £3 per annum. CLOSING OF A COURT. On the 14th May, Notice was received on behalf of the Free Trade Wharf Company and the Coopers Company of their intention to apply to two or more Justices of the Peace for the purpose ot considering the propriety of discontinuing and stopping up a certain court, alley, or place, situated between Nos. 36 and 38, Broad Street, Ratcliff, and leading from Broad Street to the River Thames, which had been disused for many years, and as shewn upon the plan accompanying the notice. The Works Committee inspected the Court ami tho Board upon their recommendation gave the required consent to the discontinuance of the Court. WILLIAMS PLACE, SALMON LANE. In May a complaint was received as to the condition of Williams Place, Salmon Lane, which was private property, and as requested by the Board I communicated with the several owners who expressed their willingness to give up to the Board their interest in the fee simple thereof, and the Board agreed to undertake the future control of the place. DELAY IN FINDING FIRE-PLUGS. The attention of the London County Council was called to the delay which occurred in ascertaining the position of fire-plugs on the occasion of a fatal fire in Gill Street. The Council replied that "the delay was occasioned in consequence of the alteration of the "position of a fire-plug of which alteration the Fire Brigade had not "been informed. Although on the occasion in question loss of life "would in all probability not have been prevented had the fire plug "been discovered sooner the Committee has determined to enquire "further into the circumstances and the District Board may rest "assured that the subject will not be lost sight of." Subsequently, in reply to a suggestion that post hydrants should be fixed in the District, a letter was received from the Clerk of the Council stating that in view of the very great additional expense that would be entailed by providing post hydrants throughout London, the Fire Brigade Committee would not feel justified in recommending the Council to adopt the suggestion. A letter was received from the Council dated 23rd July, 1891, stating that in several parishes alterations had recently been made in the form of street lamps, in many of which tablets indicating the position of hydrants and fire-plugs had been fixed, and that the substitution of improved lamps necessitated the provision at considerable expense of fresh tablets and the re glazing of thoso sides of the lamps in which such tablets were fixed, and suggesting that instructions should be given for spaces to be left for tablets in any new lamps provided in place of the old ones. The Commercial Gas Company were accordingly requested to carry out the wishes of the Council. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board.
