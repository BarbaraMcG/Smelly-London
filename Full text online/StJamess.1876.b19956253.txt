JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE TEAR 1876-1877. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, June, 1877. PAVING WORKS. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, As year by year, various Works are executed and existing defects made good, so the necessity for actually new work becomes less and less, especially in such a District as St. James's, where new thoroughfares are so rare as to amount practically to none at all; the principal matters that have to be attended to are the maintenance of such works and structures as are in the charge of the Vestry and as these works and structures increase, and from the material progress of the age, constant improvements are expected, if not demanded, or even rendered actually necessary, so the responsibility and expense of constant supervision, maintenance and reparation, increase in equal proportion, if not in greater proportion, as more scientific appliances are 14 expected to be used and far more satisfactory results are looked for than were required even a very few years since. Many of the roadways that were originally paved with what is usually called "pitching" have been converted into McAdam Roads, and the cost of their maintenance has been reported, as nearly as is practically useful, and as the roads in question were those most in want of re-laying at the time of these alterations, there are left but few at present requiring more than attention, and but for the perpetual opening by the Gas and Water Companies, it would be a long time before repairs were required to a greater portion of the Parish roadways, notwithstanding the enormous traffic. With regard to openings generally, it must be remembered that the list shows "once doing" whereas actually they have as a rule to be done at least twice, which practically doubles their number. Accidents also occur which admit of no delay in making good; several have occurred in Pall Mall, Waterloo Place, Piccadilly, and in numerous places where footway stones give way from the united causes of decayed vaults, areas, &c., rats, and strange to say, enormous worms, to say nothing of heavy weights being suddenly thrown upon worn or de. cayed paving stones. 15 MORTUARY. The actual completion of the Mortuary, is satisfactory considering the difficulties that for a time impeded the work. Sad as is the necessity for such an institution at all, the conversion of the old buildings to their present purpose has proved to be most useful; utility,and not appearance,governed the execution of the work, and above all the materials that have been used are such as cannot retain effluvia, or in other words infection. The Vestry are aware of the usefulness of the structure and the easy and thorough method of cleansing that is adopted. Altogether this mortuary may be considered as having succeeded, and however distinct from the original purpose of the building which it has followed, may now be considered as permanently established. That a building of some kind, and of some importance existed at that spot—in fact a great part still exists,—lends a kind of interest to the last alteration. The history of the previous alteration, could it be gathered, would be out of place here, but that the site of the room now appropriated as a Mortuary, has, or has had, a history, that would be 16 most interesting is beyond a doubt. Some large structure has evidently occupied the site and the foundations are there at the present time, but strangely at variance with the very substantial room recently altered into the Mortuary; this last alteration being for a useful purpose, and not to gratify curiosity, did not allow of the investigation that might have led to curious, though perhaps not useful information. The Post-mortem Examination Room has in conjunction with the Mortuary proved in its way a blessing, having been at times more than useful; both having been in use some time creates a feeling something like surprise that "things" managed to get on so long without them. The New Office 111 the stone yard and the removal of the Casual Wards, which removal was not premature, are among the Works actually done, though the precise cost of the latter has not yet been ascertained, as it was not finished by the 25th March, and the sale of the materials has not yet been effected. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. As an item will appear for the maintenance of the Public Conveniences, including repairs, it is 17 sary that some explanation should accompany a statement of money expended so soon upon perfectly new and well.constructed appliances. The gas and water supplies are necessitated, but the repairs of the gas and water fixtures are not. The glass used as the material to retain as little traces as possible of the use to which it is put, and in the lamps, where no other material can usefully be employed, has been most disgracefully destroyed time after time; and from experience I am compelled to come to the conclusion that the mischief in question, is not the work of what are generally termed "roughs," inasmnch as the use of a diamond in the destruction of the glass is apparent; now it might happen that a glazier for the good of trade might adopt such a course, but it is not probable that he would select the hour of about Two a.m. for such a purpose, while on some occasions such injuries have been found as the sequel to the visits of certain "gentlemen" at about the hour named. It is naturally disheartening to find that such appliances as are intended to meet a public want, or real necessity, and which the constituted authorities, put themselves out of the way to contrive so as not to offend the senses, or offend as little as possible consistently with utility, should be wantonly injured in a manner difficult to repair, 18 and which can afford no gratification to the perpetrators. Notwithstanding this rather cheerless view of results, I trust the Vestry will not be discouraged in their praiseworthy efforts to meet the increasing demand for a public necessity, as it amounts to more than the word convenience can imply. With personal thanks for continued confidence and constant courtesy, I have the honour to be, Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, Your most humble and obedient servant, ALBERT P. HOWELL, Surveyor. 19 GENERAL WORKS, &c. EXECUTED BY The Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, from 25th March, 1876, to 25th March, 1877. Situation. Description of Work. Amount Expended.

Particulars of Sixty-nine Articles Analysed during the year 1876 50—52 26 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF the vestry, of st. james's Westminster. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit for the year 1876 the following Report upon the Public Health of that important section of London known as the Parish of St. James's, Westminster. The District of St. James's Parish covers an area of J 64 statute acres, and the mean density of the population, taking as a basis the enumeration of 1871, is 205 persons per acre. For the Registration of Births and Deaths, the Parish was, until April 1st, 1876, divided into three "Sub-Districts"—that of St. James's Square with an area of 85 acres, and a population of 123 persons to the acre, that of Golden Square with an area of 54 acres, and a population of 238 persons to the acre, and that of Berwick Street with an area of 25 acres, and a population of no less than 411 persons to the acre. In 1876 the area of St. James's Parish was re-arranged by the Registrar-General into two Sub-Districts, "The Golden Square Sub-District," 26 remaining as before, the new "Berwick Street SubDistrict," being constituted by amalgamating the St. James's Square Sub-District with the old Berwick Street Sub-District. The Registration of Births and Deaths upon the new basis commenced from April 2nd, 1876. The numbers and distribution of the population in the three former Sub-Districts at each of the last five decennial enumerations are shown by the following figures:— * Census. St. James's District, Area 164 acres. St. James's Square Sub-District, Area 85 acres. Golden Square Sub-District, Area 54 acres. Berwick Street Sub-District, Area 25 acres. 1831 37,053 1841 37,398 13,337 13,612 10,449 1851 36,406 11,469 14,139 10,798 1861 35,326 10,753 13,966 10,607 1871 33,619 10,472 12,860 10,287 It thus appears that since 1841 the population of St. James's has been continuously decreasing, and that now it numbers some four thousands less than it did thirty years ago. This exceptional condition follows from the fact that St. James's has long since been fully built over, and that, of late years, it has increasingly become the centre for Clubs, Hotels, and splendid shops, retailing goods which are often unique in their quality and artistic value. The *The first line of figures cannot be completed, as the Sub-District areas were not formed until 1837. 27 result has been an enormous rise in the value of houses and a gradual extrusion of the less wealthy and important residents. During the year 1876 the following number of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's:— First Quarter 201 Second Quarter 164 Third Quarter 132 Fourth Quarter 124 Gross mortality for year 1876 621 Deduct Deaths of Non-Parishioners Dying in the Workhouse 39 Dying in the Throat Hospital 9 — 48 Nett mortality for year 1876 573 573 deaths in a population of 33,500 is a nett death rate of 1701 per 1000. In the year 1875 the nett death rate was 18.5 per 1000. The mortality of St. James's during the last six years has been:— Year 1871 Deaths 680 „ 1872 „ 620 „ 1873 „ 629 „ 1874 „ 592 „ 187 „ 621 „ 1876 „ 573 28 The following table shows the periods of life in which the deaths have occurred in the last three years respectively. 1874.
