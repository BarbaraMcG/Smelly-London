Alderman and Councillors London, E.l. of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report on thG state of the public health in Stepney for the year 1953. The population of the Bprough, according to the RegistrarGeneral's estimate is down by 430 on last year, and is now 98,570. The "Census" population for 1951 was 98,581. The death rate* is reduced from 13.84 to 12.04, and the still birth rate* from 26.22 to 19.91. The live birth rate* Is up from 19.13 in 1952 to 19.4tS this year, and the total number of births registered rose . from 1894 to 1919. For some reason, which is difficult to explain, the deaths of infants under one year of age, which had been steadily declining, have gone up from 35 last year to 75 this year. The infant, mortality rate * last year, vis. l8.47t which was the lowest in the history of the Borough, has risen to 39.08 - the highest since 1946, The details- of these infant deaths are shown'on page 53. The maternal mortality rate* was 0.51, and there was only one maternal death. There were no deaths from scarlet fever or diphtherial but 3 from whooping cough and 1 from measles. *,Death rate - the: number of deaths per annum per 1000 population. Still birth rate - the number of still births er annum per 1000 total live ana still births. Live birth rate - the number of live births per annum per 1000 population. Infant mortality rate - the number of deaths per annum of infants under one: y ear of age per 1000 live births. Maternal mortality rate - the number of deaths er annum of women 1scribed to pregnancy, chilobearihg, abortion, etc., per 1000 live ano still births. iii No cases of smallpox or typhoid occurred in the Borough. However, there was one case of paratyphoid B which recovered, and seven confirmed cases of poliomyelitis (5 paralytic and 2 non-paralytic), with no deaths. Tuberculosis notifications increased from 149 to 180, but deaths were seven less than last year, Certain types of cancer, particularly lung cancer, show an increase. In England and Wales the death rate of lung cancer has doubled since 1941. In Stepney, deaths from cancer of the lung increased from 44 last year to 53 this year? and 90% were males. The correlation between cigarette smoking and cancer of the lung continues to exercise the minds of research workers both here and in the United States. Regulations known as the Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations were introduced in 1930 to prevent the spread of psittacosis,- be-lieved to be due to the importation of infected parrots. The regulations were revoked in January, 1952, but similar regulations were reimposed this year in February (Parrots and Miscellaneous Birds (Prohibition of Importation) Order, 1952), because of some recurrence of psittacosis. Human psittacosis is not a notifiable disease, but 52 cases were diagnosed in England and Wales in 1952, with one death, and 33 cases in 1953* with no deaths. The cases showed. contact usually with parrots or budgerigars, but also in a few cases with pigeons, chickens, etc. The care of aged persons continues to be a problem, and our difficulties cannot be better expressed than in the words of Dr.G.Nisbet, Medical Officer of Health for the Northamptonshire (Soke of Peterborough) County Council. Dr.Nisbet writes "In previous generations, children getting married set "up their household near to the parental home, and were "therefore able to look after and care for their parents "in old age. Now. with housing estates on the periphery "of the town, distant from the parents' home, and with "the smaller families, combined often, I am sad to say, "with complete disinterest, many aged folk have to depend "on assistance arranged by the local health authority. "This is of material help, but will not solve the problem. "The days when granny or grandpa had an honoured place in "the inglenook by the fireplace are truly gone. Too often, iv "I find those.aged parents eking out a lonely existence "in sub-standard surroundings, unaware themselves of the "facilities which can be given to them in the way of help "or nursing, and shy to make new friends at old people's "clubs, etc., very frequently reluctant to accept any "benefit they might consider as 'charity'. It does give "great pleasure, on occasion, to assist some of these "old people and to know that? in the future, we may be "able to do more to make their declining years more "comfortable." The photographs opposite page 7 show a beautiful new home for aged persons, which was erected in the Borough during the year. Progress in the provision of new housing accommodation, both by the Borough Council and by the County Council continues apace, as is evidenced by the list on page 63 of new dwellings erected and by the photographs opposite page 31. In conclusion, my appreciation and thanks are expressed to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committed for the support they haye given me during 1953. I desire also to thank the Staff of the Public Health Department for their efficient work and co-operation throughout the year. I have the honour to be, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. R.

STATISTICS & SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. General Information. The Metropolitan Borough of Stepney is bounded on the west side by the City of London, on the north side by the boroughs of Shoreditch and Bethnal Green, on the east side by the borough of Poplar, and on the south by the river Thames, the river front being some 2.39 miles in length. It is roughly rectangular in shape, the length being 2.3 miles and the breadth varying from 1 to ij miles, and possesses approximately 90 miles of streets. The area of the Borough is 1,902 acres, and of this the river accounts for 136 acres and the inland water, consisting of docks and canals, 75 acres. Dark blue London clay.is found under the whole borough at a depth of between 20 and 30 feet from the surface. Above this level are layers and patches of gravel and sand, brown and yellow clays being found nearer the surface. In some parts of the borough are layers of "made" ground, the result of earlier habitation, and. as is to be expected, the flow of sub-soil water is towards the river. The area is to a large extent industrial in character, factory premises being spread throughout the borough but tending to be concentrated towards the western end, with docks and wharves stretching along the whole of the river front, which forms the southern boundary. The chief industry of the Borough is the manufacture of clothing of all kinds, it being estimated'that a third of the tailoring industry of London is carried on in Stepney. Other major industries include brewing, cigarette making, engineering and the manufacture of furniture. Population. The Registrar-General's mid-year estimate for 1953 is 98,570. The census taken in 1951 showed the population to be 98,581. The density of the population is now 55.81 persons per acre. % • Births. The total number of live births registered in the Borough during the year was 3,634, and of this number 1,878 3 MAP OF METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY KEY B.ST. = Bishopsgate Goods Station.

In addition, 163-births belonging to Stepney occurred outside the Borough, making a total of 1,919 births (985 male and 934 female) to Stepney residents. 3,344 births occurred in hospitals in the Borough, 1,4% of this number being born to Stepney residents. The live birth-rate is 19.46 per thousand of the population, the highest since 1948. The rate when adjusted by the comparability factor is 16.97, compared with the County of London rate of 17.5 and the rate for England and Wales of 15.5. Illegitimate live births numbered 156, representing 8.1 per cent of the total live births. Still-births numbered 39, representing a rate of 19.91 per 1,000 total births. Comparative vital statistics for the' year as between England and Wales, the Administrative County of London and Stepney are shown in Table 5 on page 55. . Marriages. The number of marriages registered during the year was 868, 39 less than last year. The rate of marriages per 1,000 population is 17.6, and in 1952 it was 18.3. Deaths. The net number of deaths registered during the year was 1,187 (724 males and 463 females), as compared with 1,371 last year. The Rate of 12.04 compares with 13.84 for 1952. The principal causes of death were from heart disease, which accounted for 23 per cent of the total deaths, cancer 20 per cent, and diseases of the respiratory system 19 per cent. 63 per cent of the deaths were of persons over the age of 65, and included one woman aged 100. See pages 51 and 52 for summary. In England and Wales to-day the expectation of life of a boy at birth is 67.06 years and of a girl 72.35 years, compared v/ith 48.53 and 52.38 years between the years 1901 and 1910. Road Accidents. Table 2. on page 52- summarises road accidents which have occurred in the Borough over the past 5 years, for which information I am indebted to Mr.A.S.Monckton, the Council's Road Safety Organiser. 4 Infant Mortality. The deaths of infants under one year of age numbered 75) giving a rate of 39.08 per thousand live births as compared with 18.47 last year. The rate for England and Wales is 26.8 and that for London 24.8. There were 39 deaths of infants under 4 weeks old. representing a rate of 20.32 per thousand live births. Last year there were 23 neo-natal deaths, and the rate was 12,13 per thousand live births. The neo-natal mortality rate for England and Wales is 17.7 per thousand live births. The main causes of death among infants under one year of age were prematurity and congenital malformations. Tables on pa^es 53/54 show deaths from stated causes at various ages under one year, together with comparative figures over the last 3 years. Maternal Mortality. One maternal death occurred during the year, giving a rate of 0.51 per 1,000 total births. The death was due to obstetric shock following spontaneous abortion, which was confirmed by post mortem examination. The patient left hospital against advice during treatment for pyelitis and was readmitted 12 days later with commencing abortion. Comparative Statistics. A table showing vital statistics for the Borough from the year 1901 is given on page 56. Unemployment. The Ministry of Labour has kindly supplied me with the following information as to the estimated number of persons residing in the Borough registered as unemployed at the end of the years- Men Boys Women Girls 1,796 24 169 13 = Total 2,002. The total number unemployed at the end of 1952 was 2,271. 5 II. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES WELFARE OF AGED PERSONS. The Council is empowered by Section 47 of the National Assistance Act. 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951? to make application to the Courts for orders for the removal to hospitals or institutions of aged, infirm or physically incapacitated persons who are living in insanitary conditions and who are in need of care and attention. During the year it was necessary to apply for 12 Removal Orders and 2 Extension Orders, details of which are given below. The orders operate for 3 months in cases of removal to hospitals and for 6 weeks to institutions, unless otherwise stated. In addition to living in insanitary conditions and being unable to devote to themselves, and not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention, the persons removed were also either - * (a) suffering from a grave chronic disease, or (b) aged and/or infirm, or (c) physically incapacitated.

The Council's Inspector occasionally visits old people after their ranoval to a welfare home or hospital, and reports in the majority of cases that they have settled down well and appear to be happy in their new surroundings. The majority of visits to aged persons.made by officers of this Department are carried out "by the Council's woman Sanitary Inspector and woman Hygiene Assistant, and 2,490 visits were made by these officers during the year. A register of old people so visited is kept in the Department, a summary of which is as follows Number on register at 1st Januaiy, 1953 480 Additions to the register during the year 337 Removals from the register during the year 72 Number on register at 31st Decanber, 1953 745 The Council provides a service for disinfesting and cleansing bed linen and personal clothing, under Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. This service. although not provided solely for old folk, affords most benefit to such people. In addition, household effects from the homes of 6 old persons were removed and destroyed under this section. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953? made further provision for the cleansing in their own homes of aged persons who are veiminous or otherwise in need of cleansing to prevent injury or danger of injury to health, and who are so enfeebled that they are unable to cleanse themselves properly. Daring the year 315 baths were given to 29 old persons in these circumstances, the Council's cl ean"Sing~attendants carrying out the work with the aid of portable bath equipment. There are 15 old people's clubs in the Borough j whose activities are co-ordinated by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association. The Council is represented on this body by the- Chairman of the Public Health Committee and other members of the Council, and the Medical Officer of Health, and applications to the Council by old persons' clubs for grants under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, and referred to the Association for investigation. Grants made to clubs by the Council during the year amounted to £1,795. 7 SYDNEY HOUSE — HOME FOR THE ELDERLY BEAUMONT SQUARE, MILE END. (Architect - The Late Mr. C. H. James, R.A., F.R.I.B.A.) West Front. View from Beaumont Square Gardens. A Meals on Wheels service is provided for the old folk, run jointly by the Old People's Welfare Association and the Women's Voluntary Services, over 12,000 meals being delivered during the year. Four of the clubs include Luncheon Clubs among their facilities, and provided over 14,000 meals in 1953. Chiropody Clinics are provided at five of the Clubs. SYDNEY HOUSE HOME FOR THE ELDERLY. BEAUMONT SQUARE, MILE END. On 27th January, 1954, this new home for old people was opened in the Borough by the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Noel V, Bowater, Bt., M.C., and the Mayor of Stepney, Councillor J.P.Long, J.P. This .home, which accommodates 36 men and women from all parts of London, began to take in residents on 9th June, 1953? and was built by a housing association known as the London Homes for the Elderly Limited, This association received grants from the Lord Mayor's National Air Raid Distress Fund and from.the National Corporation for the Care of Old People, The management committee of the home has on it representatives of the London County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs, Most of the old persons admitted are eligible under the terms of the National Assistance Act, 1948, and apart from any contribution made by them the maintenance cost in these cases is paid by the London County Council as welfare authority. The- secretariat of the home is provided by the National Corporation for the Care of Old People. The home is in the charge of a Matron who is a State Registered Nurse. The National Corporation for the Care of Old People was established under the Nuffield Foundation, and the London Homes for the Elderly Limited is a housing association established under the National Corporation for the express purpose of providing homes for elderly persons. Photographs of the Home appear opposite page 7. FREE WASHING FACILITIES. An increasing number of tho public used tho free washing facilities provided by the Borough Council in public conveniences, some 42,000 free washes being taken during the year. This service was established in order to promote food and personal hygiene and cleanliness, 8 MATERNITY AMD CHILD WELFARE I am indebted to Dr.G.O.Mitchell, Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council, for the following information relating to the personal health services administered by the London County Council in the Borough. 1.

I am indebted for the following information to the Information Officer, Mr.J.Mordsley, who administers the Service under the direction of the Borough Librarian. During the year under review-, the number of persons seeking information or. advice at- £he Information Centre reached a total of 11,414. A full analysis of the enquiries received is given overleaf. The scope of the enquiries has remained as varied as ever although' questions about rationing, trading conditions and supplies'have decreased considerably, which perhaps is a reflection of the steady return to pre-war conditions in retail trading. The housing position in Stepney still remains acute, resulting in- many instances of "landlord and tenant" problems and family disturbances, which are perhaps-inevitable when young married- people with children are compelled to live at the home of one of the parents. -Very often in these cases? one or other of the parties concerned call at the Information Centre for advice on ways of smoothing out the difficulties. Enquiries connected with old.people remain a feature of the work of the Information Service. The social legislation of 1948 went a long way to relieve the financial problems of old age, but'strange as*it may seem there are still many old people whose pride or spirit of independence makes them hesitate or refuse to apply to the National Assistance Board for help, and who try to manage on the basic rate of their pension plus any meagre savings they may have. There are others who feel they are no longer wanted and live very lonely lives mainly because they are unaware of the many facilities now available to them in the borough. It is very satisfying to be able to draw the attention of the various statutory and voluntary organisations,who are both able and. willing to help, to the cases brought to the notice of the Information Service. An ever-growing index of authoritative and accurate information has been built up at the Information Centre from which immediate replies are given to many of the requests for information received. On the other hand, some of the personal problems cannot so easily be dealt with as many of them call for the exercise of understanding and sympathy in extracting the details, and when these are known, the experience, knowledge and judgement of the staff are brought into play in finding an acceptable solution. 12 STEPNBY BOROUGH COUNCIL INFORMATION SERVICE (contd.)

A new feature of the Department's Health Education activities was introduced during the year, namely an automatic film strip projector. The advantage of this projector is that it does not need an operator, but can be exhibited, for example, in a shop window, the frames of the film strip changing automatically every few seconds. Films on Tuberculosis and Diphtheria Immunisation were shown during the year. Topics hired from the Central Council for Health Education and displayed on the Exhibition Stand included Food Infection, Milk Infection, Care of the Teeth and Care of the Feet. The usual Diphtheria Immunisation Campaign was arranged on request of the Ministry of Health, but at a later period in the year owing to a postponement occasioned by' the Incidence of poliomyelitis. The former Empire Marketing Boards were kept posted during the year with special poster sets. Posters on various subjects were also displayed on the Council's official Notice Boards, in all Council Establishments, and on Council vehicles. Some 10,000 leaflets were also distributed through the media of the Exhibition Stand, the Public Health offices, the Information Centre and Infant Welfare Centres. Enamelled panels, showing details of hospitals with times for attendance where advice or treatment on Veneral Diseases can be obtained, were renewed in all cubicles in the Council's Public Conveniences. At the requests of the Sanitary Inspectors, notices warning the public against depositing rubbish in contravention of the Council's Bye-laws were posted on 22 sites in the area. 15 LEGISLATION.

The duties of the District Sanitary Inspectors are many and varied, and involve the implementation of many Acts of Parliament and Byelaws and Regulations made thereunder. The face of the Borough is beginning to show signs of recovery from the ravages of war, and much of the work put in by the Sanitary Inspectors during the past few years has helped to contribute to this effect. Summaries of inspections made and sanitary work effected during the year are given on pages 57 and 58. Complaints received relating to Public Health nuisances. 4,551 complaints were recorded in the register, but in addition numerous complaints were made direct to the District Sanitary Inspectors. The number of visits made in'investigating complaints was 8,016. Dangerous Structures. The District Surveyor of the London County Council was notified on 297 occasions of premises or parts of premises alleged to be structurally dangerous. Drainage. 1,408 drains were tested with smoke and'195 were found to be defective. 6,645 visits of inspection were made to drainage works during the year, and 588 drains were cleansed or repaired and 360 constructed or reconstructed. Observations were submitted to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor on 107 plans'of new drainage works. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953, will make provision for prohibiting the entry of certain matters into sewers and drains and for regulating the admission of trade effluents. Factories. 762 inspections under the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, were made by the Sanitary Inspectors of the 2,995 factories on the register, and 103 notices, were served. Details will be found in Table 9 on page 59. 19 Outworkers. 21 inspections were made of Outworkers' premises. There are 553 premises on the register, the trades concerned being as follows Wearing Apparel 519 Umbrellas 3 Christmas Crackers, etc. 8 Feather Sorting 1 Brushes 1 Paper Bags 1 Carding etc. of Buttons 4 Chocolate & Sweetmeats 4 Cardboard Boxes 11 Stuffed Toys 1 There were two notifications of infectious disease relating to Outworkers' premises. Firms in the Borough employing Outworkers 40 Outworkers residing in and employed by firms in the Borough 94 Outworkers residing outside the Borough employed by firms in the Borough 182 Outworkers residing in the Borough employed by firms outside the Borough 459 Fireguards. The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, which came into operation on 23rd March, 1953? prohibits the sale or letting on hire of gas and electric fires and oil heaters which are not fitted with effective fireguards conforming to the prescribed standards. By Regulations, appliances (other than imported ones) manufactured before 1st October, 1953, may be sold or let on hire at any time up to 1st October, 1954, so that the provisions of the Act or Regulations will not come into full effect until the latter date. The Regulations specify tests of.efficiency to be carried out in order to ascertain whether the guards comply with the standard of construction and fitting required. Caravanners. No formal action was taken under the Byelaws against occupiers of caravans, but frequent visits were made to camp sites in the Borough, and several unauthorised squatters were persuaded to evacuate sites which wer'e subsequently fenced in by the London County Council. Houses Let in Lodgings. There are approximately 730 such premises in the Borough, and 56 complaints were investigated during the year. 20 Land Charges Act, 1925. The number of enquiries dealt with during the year regarding outstanding notices under the Public Health and Housing Acts, and reported to the Town Clerk, amounted to 723, which related to 1,810 properties. Legal Proceedings. A summary of legal proceedings instituted during the year, showing penalties imposed, is as follows:- No. of Summonses Fines Costs Food and Drugs Act, 1938. 24 £52.10.0 £25.16.0 Public Health (London) Act, 1 Nuisance Orders 61 4. 0.0 138. 6.6 Non-compliance with Nuisance Orders 10 191.10.0 8.16.0 Offensive Business 1 5. 0.0 3. 3.0 Common Lodging House 1 5. 0.0 2. 2.0 L.C.C.

An appeal by an owner against an Abatement Order was heard at the County of London Sessions, resulting in the appeal being disallowed and £5.5.0 costs awarded to the Council. Licensed Premises. At the request of the Licensing Justices, inspections are made of Public Houses and Off Licences when applications for grant or transfer of licences are being made under the Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910, now replaced by the Licensing Act, 1953. The Sanitary Inspectors" reports are taken into consideration when the applications come before the Sessions. Reports on 80 premises were submitted during the year. 21 Lodging Houses - Common. A licence was granted during the year to keep the premises 86, Cable Street, as a Common Lodging House. A person was convicted and fined during the year for keeping premises as a common lodging house without a licence. A further summons was issued later in the year on the same person in respect of a similar offence on the same premises, and after several adjournments the case was heard early in 1954, when the Magistrate dismissed the summons as it was not established that the premises constituted a common lodging house, A similar summons in respect of another premises was also dismissed at the same time. The experience gained in these cases demonstrates the urgent need for a clear statutory definition of a Common Lodging House. There are five Common Lodging Houses in the Borough, providing accommodation for 1,111 persons, as follows 86 Cable Street. 15 & 16 Calvin Street, 10-22 Johnson Street, 177 Whitechapel Road. Hostel for Women, Hopetown St. 8 men. 41 married couples. 258 men. 535 men. 228 women. 62 inspections were made "during the year, including 14 inspections carried out at night. Lodging Houses - Seamen's. An application for trc-nsfcrof licence to keep the premises 9, Ensign Street, as a Seamen's Lodging House, was refused during the year. There are how five- such premises in the Borough, providing accommodation for 477 seamen, as followss- The Sailors' Home & Red Ensign Club, Ensign Street and Dock Street, 235 seamen. The Empire Memorial Hostel, 747 Commercial Road. 190 " 5 North East Passage. 11 " 220 Cable Street, 30 " 11 Ensign Street. 11 " 79 inspections were made during the year, including 23 inspections carried out at night. 22 Mosquitoes - Nuisance in Dock Areas. An outbreak of infestation by a biting mosquito known as Culex molestus occurred in districts in the dock areas for a period of several weeks between September and November, and considerable difficulty was experienced in tracing the source. .Eventually, with the kind assistance of the Medical Research Council's Malaria Reference Laboratory, exploration was made in an underground reservoir belonging to a hydraulic power company. This was found to be heavily infested with larvae and adult Culex molestus mosquitoes. Treatment of the reservoir with oil proved very effective. Noise Nuisances. Five complaints received during the year of alleged noise nuisance were investigated, resulting in the service of one notice under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937. Notices Served. Informal notices served under the various Acts during the year were as followst- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 4418 Factories Act, 1937 & 1948 103 Shops Act, 1950 9 Byelaws for Houses in Separate Tenements 6 London County Council (Poultry Slaughterhouse) Byelaws 4 London County Council (General.Powers) Act. 1937 (Noise Nuisance) 1 London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1939 (Ashpits) 1 Stepney Council Pleasure Fair Byelaws, 1952 1 Miscellaneous 5 4548 Formal statutory notices served during the year amounted to 1,204. Offensive Accumulations of Refuse. Accumulations of refuse in basements which were used during the war as emergency water supply tanks were removed by the Borough Council, acting as agents for the County Council. 23 Offensive Trades, There are now 18 offensive businesses in the Borough, and 133 inspections were made during the year. The premises at 8a Hessel Street was removed from the register, which now includes s- Tripe Boiler (1) 94 Wentworth Street. Dressers of Furskins (3) 34/38 Brodlove Lane. * 48, 50, 50a, 54 & 56 Old Church Road. 29 Spelman Street.

The Establishment Orders of premises marked (*) are subject to renewal from time to time by the Council. Pet Animals. All keepers of pet shops must be licensed by the local authority under the Pet Animals Act, 1951? and conditions to to be complied with are specified with respect to accommodation, feeding, fire precautions, age of animals sold, etc. No pets may be sold in streets, except in markets at stalls or barrows, nor may they be sold to' persons under 12 years of age. In Stepney, so far, there are no actual pet shops 5 such pets as are sold in the Borough are from market stalls. During the year 5 persons were licensed under the Act. 24 Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1913, and Pharmacy & Medicines Act, 1941. 109 premises are listed for the sale of poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. Applications received during the year were as follows:- For Entry 5 " Retention 104 134 visits were made to these premises. The Poisons List Order, 1953? made some amendments to the Poisons List, Amended Poisons Rules were also issued during the year. Rag Dealers. A rag dealer was cautioned for a contravention of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1952, in that he supplied an article in exchange for rags to a person under the age of 15 years. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. 1951. Premises in the area registered under this Act number 18, and another is licensed. During the year 3° inspections were made of these premises, and 21 formal samples of filling materials were taken. The Analyst reported that a sample of jute was found on analysis not to comply with the prescribed standards, and the occupier of the premises from which the sample was obtained was cautioned. The Analyst reported that he was unable to test a sample submitted to him of rubberised hair which was being used as a filling material, as apparently the outer layer of rubber would be attacked by one of the chemical solutions normally used In the impurities test. Rubberised hair is quite a recent innovation, .and at the moment the danger of secondhand material being used is fairly remote. By virtue of the rubber covering, the material itself is exempt from the Act. Should the use of such a filling material become more common, an amendment will, no doubt, be framed to bring it within the Act. Refuse Disposal. The Public Cleansing Officer has kindly supplied the following information on refuse and salvage disposed of during the year:- House and Trade 33,398 tons., Street and Market 8,412 " Salvage: Waste Paper 95 " Kitchen Waste 560 " 25 Rodent Control. Rat destruction is carried out both by trapping and poisoning. In the Stepney scheme poisoning is the method mainly used. The usual poisons are zinc phosphide and arsenous oxide, A new poison, Warfarin, has come into use since 1951, and during 1953 we made greater use of it in Stepney, and are finding it very effective.. Warfarin is a powder which acts by preventing normal blood clotting. After absorption over a period the rat dies from internal haemorrhages. One of the problems associated with the use of Warfarin has been to find a suitable base with which to mix it. We have found medium grade oatmeal a satisfactory base in most cases, A new base more attractive to the rats is now recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and consists of pihhead oatmeal, castor sugar and technical white oil or light liquid paraffin B.P, This may help to overcome the difficulty of dealing with rats in infested premises where rat-attractive foods are normally, stored. Warfarin can also be used as a rodenticidal dust, i.e. mixed with an inert powder spread fairly thickly on the rat runways. The powder thus adheres to the feet and bodies .of the rats and mice, and is absorbed by them in the normal^ process of cleaning themselves by licking. This method cannot safely be used with poisons other than anticoagulants of the Warfarin type, because the concentration required would involve risks to humans and domestic animals. In the strength used, the anticoagulant dusts are only lethal after repeated contamination spreading over several days. In accordance with a request of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, statistics on rodent control work carried out by the department which were submitted to the Ministry covered the period 1st January, 1953, to 31st March, 1954, Future annual reports will cover the period 1st April to 31st March. During the 15 months under review, 13*613 dwellings and business premises were inspected. Charges for servicing made to occupiers of business premises amounted to £1,189. 26 Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts; During the year, 69 applications were received from occupiers for certificates stating that premises were not in a reasonable state of repair: 66 were granted and 3 refused. 67 applications were received from owners for revocation certificates: 35 were granted and 32 refused. 157 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with these applications. Shops. During the year, 383 inspections were made under the Shops Act, 1950, and 9 notices were served in respect of sanitary accommodation. The number of premises in the Borough covered by the provisions of the Act is 2,620. No applications were received for exemption from complying with sanitary accommodation requirements. Smoke Abatement. During the year a very practical report on air pollution was submitted by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to the Beaver Committee of Enquiry on Air Pollution. Mention is made of the great increase in the number of modern heating appliances installed in local authorities' housing estates and in privately-owned houses. These modern grates are intended to be used with smokeless fuel, but in practice are operated continuously, night and day, on low quality fuel, notorious for producing smoke. Moreover, the fires are banked up at night with coal dust. It is unfortunate that the action of Borough Councils in providing modern grates should result in increased smoke nuisance by the failure of the atmosphere to clear itself at night. Among recommendations made are that stokers and firemen should be especially trained and that they should be allowed to attend courses and lectures in their working hours; that proof of efficiency should be a condition of a stoker's employment and that the status of his job should be raised; that before domestic fuel-burning appliances are installed they should receive prior approval of the local authority 5 and that extra fuel storage should be provided to enable tenants of housing estates to use smokeless fuels. The Government Committee on National Policy for the Use of Fuel and Power Resources published a report (the "Ridley Report") during the year. Booklets published by the National Smoke Abatement Society containing excerpts of the Report were 27 distributed to all occupiers of industrial premises in the Borough who have boilers and furnaces on their premises, and to property owners and estate agents who own or manage dwelling-houses in the Borough, Two stations were set up in the Borough during the year for recording and measuring atmospheric pollution. Each station has two instruments, one for measuring pollution occurring from ash or grit, and the other for recording the activity of sulphur trioxide in the atmosphere in attacking the fabric of buildings. The gauges are collected monthly, the contents being analysed by the Public Analyst. They are at present sited on the roofe of St .George's Town Hall and the London Jewish Hospital. The number of complaints of smoke nuisance received during the year was 4, and the number of observations kept was 91. Water Supply. The whole of the Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, which is the authority responsible for its purity. Quantity and quality of the water supplied by the Board during the year have been satisfactory, and no complaints were received. All premises in the Borough are supplied individually direct from public water mains, with the exception of two places which are supplied by means of a common standpipe. The number of instances where water supply to premises in the Borough was repaired or reinstated totalled 175y and the Metropolitan Water Board was notified on 56 occasions of premises where wastage of water was taking place. During the year notices were received from the Metropolitan Water Board to the effect that the water supply from 8 premises had been withdrawn, in 5 premises for non-payment of rates and in 3 because of defects in the service. Water Certificates. Water Certificates under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, as to new dwellings having a proper and sufficient supply of water were issued in respect of 652 flats and 96 houses. 28 Wells. Bacteriological and chemical analyses of water from the 7 deep wells in industrial use in the Borough are made periodically, and the results of such analyses are reported to this Department. Workplaces. There are known to be 362 workplaces in the area (other than those covered by the Factories Act, 1937), and 7 complaints were investigated during the year. 29 IV. housing Overcrowding. During the year, 238 cases of alleged overcrowding were investigated, 112 of which were confirmed and referred to the London County Council. 124 overcrowded families were rehoused, 102 by the London County Council and 22 by the Borough Council, and the number of known overcrowded families on the register decreased from 1184 to 1172. 209 visits were made to premises to ascertain "permitted numbers", and the owners of the premises were informed. In order to prevent overcrowding, 37 inspections were made for the Government of Cyprus of accommodation alleged to be available in the Borough for intending immigrants. Underground Rooms. There are approximately 3,639 underground rooms in the Borough used for living or sleeping purposes, about 3,519 of which are unfit. During the year 260 inspections were carried out. as a result of which 13 Closing Orders were, made, 36 rooms being closed and the modified occupation of 15 rooms approved. The number of underground rooms closed since 1936 totals to date 236, Progress on closure generally is held up for lack of suitable alternative accommodation. Town & Country Planning (Housing Accommodation) Direction, 1952. Under this order, the Borough Council is consulted by the London County Council (the Planning Authority) before applications are determined for planning permission for development involving change of user of premises from use as a dwelling. Investigations on 47 such applications were carried out during the year. Applications for Rehousing. At the. end of the year there were 5,672 applications for rehousing on the Housing Manager's register (an increase of 708 over 1952), including 292 tenants of Council dwellings and 514 licensees of requisitioned premises who applied for transfers. 30 Preferential Housing on Health Grounds, Of the 86 cases investigated, 49 were recommended for rehousing: 1 to the County Council and 48 to the Borough Council. Temporary Hutments. 203 hutments owned by the Borough Council remained at the end of the year, 41 were recommended for demolition because of structural deterioration. Requisitioned Properties. The number of dwellings under requisition by the Borough Council at the end of the year was 1,692, involving 2,371 lettings, 2 dwellings were recommended to the Housing Manager for derequisitioning for various reasons, and 23 basement rooms which did not comply with the regulations were recommended for closure, • . —- Demolition Orders* Under the provisions of Soction 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, 6 Demolition Orders were made during the year. Appeals were lodged in two cases, one being upheld by the Court on the undertaking of the applicant to use the premises for storage accommodation only, and the other also upheld as the Court considered the house could be made fit at reasonable cost, in spite of the estimated cost (£1200) to make the premises fit being more than twice the agreed value of the house, Under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953, the Council may. if it is inexpedient to make a Demolition Order under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, having regard to the effect of demolition of the house upon any other house or building, make a Closing Order in lieu thereof. The Council may also at any time revoke the Closing Order and make a Demolition Order. It was not found necessary to take any action under this provision this year. Immigration into the Borough and Coloured Persons. Although many Stepney residents leave the Borough in the course of the year to take up residence elsewhere, there is evidence of increased migration into the Borough, not only from other parts of the United Kingdom, but also from the colonies of the West Indies and West Africa and from India and Pakistan, 31 OLD STEPNEY AND NEW STEPNEY — THE OCEAN ESTATE OF THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL.

Household Hygienic Amenities. (viz. Piped water supply, cooking stove or range, kitchen sink, water-closet and fixed bath.) Figures from the 1951 Census, since published, have brought out the' information that one-third.of all private households in the County of London have the exclusive use of all the above amenities, and another twenty per cent have all except a fixed bath. Sixty-two per cent do not have the exclusive use of a fixed bath. The incidence of households entirely without a fixed bath is highest in the boroughs of central and eastern London.

Tons cwts. ars. lbs. Wharves 51 13 2 19 London Fruit Exchange and Spitalfields Market 52 2 0 22 Railway Depots 14 17 1 13 Zeebrugge-Harwich Train Ferry (at Bishopsgate Goods Station) 8 19 1 3 Other Premises 68 14 0 26 Total: 196 6 2 27 Approximately 40. tons was allowed to be used for animal feeding purposes or for manufacturing purposes other than Tor human consumption, the remainder being delivered to the Public Cleansing Department where itwns mixed"with other household refuse under the supervision- of the Public Cleansing Officer, and removed by barge to a controlled tipping site in Kent. Zeebrugge-Harwich Train Ferry. 287 special midnight or early morning and 158 other visits were made to Bishopsgate Goods Station for the purpose of examining 4,435 trucks of foodstuffs arriving from the following countries:- Italy 3989 trucks. Germany 27 " Austria 10 " Yugo Slavia 315 Australia 3 " Belgium 75 trucks Greece 4 " Switzerland 9 Spain 2 " Holland 1 " 37 The weight of the foodstuffs examined was 35,500 tons, comprising fresh fruit and vegetables 34,021 tons ; preserved fruit etc, 370 tons; cheese 246 tons; fish 45 tons 5 canned meats, sausages etc. 394 tons; pork 13 tons; biscuits, chocolates and confectionery 296 tons; frozen horse meat 23 tons; custard powder 14 tons; canned soup and Soup powders 66 tons; wine 12 tons. The food stuffs found to be unsound, and which were stopped and destroyed, amounted to almost 9 tons. Samples taken included Yugo Slavian salami, fruit pulp, dried and preserved fruits, Italian apples and chocolate and Swiss soup powders. Two casks of Yugo Slavian apricot pulp were contaminated by extraneous matter during unloading and were condemned and destroyed. Samples taken from a consignment of Yugo Slavian apricot pulp arriving in June were found to contain sulphur dioxide preservative in amounts ranging from 1780 to 2760 parts per million. The public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations require that apricot pulp must not contain more than 1500 parts per million. The consignment was detained and later released for manufacturing purposes on condition that the resultant product (jam) would not contain more than the legal maximum of sulphur dioxide preservative. The local authorities of the areas to which the pulp was consigned were notified accordingly, and the Importer communicated with the Yugo Slavian authorities to ensure that future Imports of th6 pulp comply with the Regulations. Six samples taken from sub sequent consignments were found, on analysis, to be satisfactory. Some Australian horse meat examined was originally intended for human consumption, in Belgium but was diverted to this country. It was accompanied by the official certificates of the Australian Government and was released for sale for human consumption, due notification being sent to the local authority concerned, Two samples of Yugo Slavian chocolate dolls were found, on analysis, to contain 11 parts per million of lead. (Chocolate should not contain lead in excess of 5 parts per million). This chocolate was delivered to two consignees outside the Borough, one firm taking 335 cases and the other 5 cases. Negotiations are pending in Yugo Slavia between the Importer and the manufacturer with a view to the possible 38 export of the chocolate. Meanwhile the chocolate has been removed to a central store where it is held under the supervision of the local authority concerned who were notified of the circumstances. Details of the number and types of food pranises in the Borough will be found in Table 14 on page 65. 39 VI. PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. Weather Conditions. The weather during the year differed little from the. average. Exceptions included a strong gale in January in the North Sea, causing unprecedented coastal damage and floods on the East Coast. March was distinguished by its exceptionally high mean pressure, with no rain until the last three days of the month. May was a fine month. The Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II took place on 2nd June, and unfortunately it was a wet and dull month until the last 8 days, which were warm and sunny. The summer was not remarkable for fine weather. The months of November and December were outstanding for their mildness. It was the mildest December since 1934, 59F. being registered at Kew, The Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations. 1953. These Regulations, which supersede the Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations, 1927, and the Infectious Diseases (London) Regulations, 1927, came into operation on 1st April. The new Regulations are similar to the old, but differ in some important respects concerning food poisoning. The provisions for preventive steps to be taken against the spread of food poisoning formerly applied to enteric fever and dysentery. They now apply to typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever and other salmonella infections, dysentery, and staphylococcal infection likely to cause food poisoning. Also, under the old regulations, only a person suffering from such a disease could be prevented from continuing at work connected with the preparation and handling of food or drink. Now, similar action can be taken with carriers of the disease, and furthermore persons in either class may now be prevented, not only from continuing to work in the aforementioned occupation, but also from entering such an occupation. Notifications. A total of 1496 notifications of cases of infectious disease were received during the year, as compared with 2142 in 1952, the reduction being largely accounted for by fewer notifications of measles this year. 40 Table 15 on page 66 shows, details, of the notifications received, together with age groups. The diagnosis was not confirmed in 7 of the above notifications. A list of tho diseases notifiable in the County of London is shown in Table 16 on page 67. Diphtheria. Three notifications were received, but the diagnosis was not confirmed in two of the cases. The number of children immunised at L.C.C. clinics was 1154, and of these 1047 were under five years of age, 1272 children were given a reinforcing injection, A supply of anti-toxin is kept in the Department for use by general practitioners in emergency cases, 95 swabs were forwarded by general practitioners to the Mile End Group Laboratory, where bacteriological examinations are carried out on behalf of the Borough Council. Dysentery. 68 notifications of Sonne Dysentery were received during the year, as compared with 73 the previous year. Erysipelas. During the year 10 notifications were received, as compared with 24 last year. Food Poisoning. Twelve individual cases of suspected food poisoning were notified. In 5 cases a salmonella organism was isolated from the patient's stools, and in no case was the source of infection traced to any particular article of food. Kala Azar. Notification was received during the year of an Indian resident in the Borough who was suffering from Kala Azar, a parasitic disease affecting the spleen and liver. This disease is unlikely to spread in this country as it is a disease of warmer climates. Malaria. Two cases of malaria were notified during the year. 41 Measles. Notifications for the year numbered 656, there being one death. There were 1284 oases in 1952. Meningococcal Infection. There were 8 notifications and 3 deaths during the year, compared with 3 notifications and 2 deaths last.year. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Of the 24 cases notified, 12. "belonged to Stepney. Paratyphoid Fever. One case of Paratyphoid B occurred during the year. The case was a child of 3 years of age: result of bacteriological examination negative; Widal positive. No source of infection was discovered, but the family had been abroad in Helsinki, Finland, earlier in the year. The case recovered. One of a party of children returning from a holiday in Switzerland subsequently developed paratyphoid. The patient was not a resident of the Borough, but two other members of the party living in the Borough were kept under supervision. About the same time a child (not a Stepney resident) from another party which returned from a holiday in France was admitted to the London Hospital suffering from the same disease. Poliomyelitis. There were 7 confirmed cases of poliomyelitis in the Borough. Last year there were 9 confirmed cases and 1 death. Pneumonia. Of the various forms of pneumonia, only acute primary and acute influenzal are notifiable. 78 cases were notified during the year, compared with 63 last year. Puerperal Pyrexia. There were 98 notifications during the year, compared with 96 in 1952. Of the 98 cases notified, 44 were residents of the Borough. 42 Scabies. Scabies is still notifiable under the County of London (Scabies) Regulations, 1943. The number of cases formally notified was 22, compared with 28 last year. Fifty-three scabies patients were treated by medicinal baths at Branch Road Treatment Centre, and their clothing disinfested, viz.:- Males Females Children Total 22 19 12 53 The number of baths given amounted to 85 during the year. Scarlet Fever. There were 75 cases notified, a decrease of 135 from last year. Only 28 per cent were admitted to hospital, as compared with 96 per cent of 968 cases notified in 1938. There were no deaths from the disease. Smallpox. No cases of smallpox were notified during the year, and it was not necessary for me to take action under the Public Health (Smallpox) Regulations, 1917. The number of children successfully vaccinated or revaccinated at L.C.C. clinics during the year was 768. A supply of vaccine is kept in the Department for emergency use. Tuberculosis. The number of primary notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis received was 167, as compared with 137 last year, and the number of non-pulmonary cases was 13, as compared with 12 in 1952. The mortality rate for the year of pulmonary tuberculosis is 39, and of non-pulmonary 0,4 per 100.000 population, as compared with 49 and 1.0 respectively in 1952. (See details of register and of notifications on page 68. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925. These regulations provide that persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract shall not be employed in the handling of milk or milk receptacles. Power is given 43 by the Council to cause such persons to discontinue their employment. It was not found necessary to take action under the regulations during the year. Tuberculosis Care Committee. The Tuberculosis Care Committee, on which are represented voluntary and official bodies, and whose meetings are attended by the Medical Officer of Health, continues to supply help to tuberculous persons and their relatives who require assistance which cannot be obtained from official sources, or where urgency or special circumstances indicate that the voluntary sources of the Care Committee are preferable. Help was given during the year to 73 persons by way of clothing, extra nourishment, provision of laundry, new spectacles, set of leather work tools, holiday expenses, rent, wireless licences and fares to relatives to visit patients in sanatoria. 19 patients were referred to the National Assistance Board and voluntary societies for help with clothing and miscellaneous items. The annual Christmas Seal Sale Fund amounted to £298. Weil's Disease. A death occurred as a result of Weil's Disease of a man employed in the Borough but resident in another area. The disease is characterised by acute fever accompanied by jaundice, and is caused by a germ known as the leptospira ictero-haemorrhagiae. It is primarily a disease of rats, and spreads to humans by actual contact with dead rats of their excreta or urine. The disease is therefore more common among workers in rat-infested.environments. ' Whooping Cough. 249 cases were notified during the year, the figure for 1952 being 156. There were 3 deaths from the disease. Infectious Disease Contacts. Where a person is precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier or having been in contact with ihfectious disease, benefits under the National Insurance Act, 1948, are only paid on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It.was not found necessary to issue any such certificate during the year. 44 Authentication of Internations Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. A person proceeding abroad is required in certain countries to produce a certificate of recent successful vaccination and inoculation. The signatures of 240 such certificates were verified by me during the year as those of medical practitioners practising in. Stepney, and the certificates were endorsed accordingly. Disinfection. 249 premises were' disinfected because of infectious disease,at which 20 were for pulmonary tuberculosis. 66,231 articles of clothing and bedding were steam disinfected, including 53,724 articles for export, for which 142 certificates were issued. Formaldehyde disinfection of 274,824 articles of clothing for export was also carried out during the year, for which 414 certificates were issued. Charges for the export disinfecting service amounted to £445. Disinfestation (3ed buges and other insect pegts). .
