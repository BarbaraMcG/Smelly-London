THE REPORT BY THE BOARD CTF WORKS for THE LEWISIIAM DISTRICT FOR THE YEAR 1874-5. PUBLISHED BY ORDER. Printed by W. II. CROCKFORD, JUN., LEWISIIAM, AND BLACKIIEATFI ROAD. 1875. REPORT. In the Report for the last year the circumstances which rendered it necessary for the Hoard to provide New Offices, and the preliminary steps taken with that object, were stated. Tenders for the erection of the Building were invited from a number of leading London Builders, and on the 7th May, 187 1, eight tenders were submitted to the Board, as under, and that of Messrs. Hill, Higgs, and Hill accepted. £ s. d. Messrs. Holland and Hammer 11,922 0 0 Mr. William Tongue 11,400 0 0 Messrs. Dove Brothers 10,985 0 0 Mr. Geo. Samuel Pritchard 10,845 0 0 Mr. Thomas Klkington 10,833 0 0 Messrs. William Downes and Co 10,290 0 0 Messrs. Thos. Rider and Son 10,220 0 0 Messrs. Hill, Higgs, and Hill 9,784 0 0 I ho Contract for the Building was signed on the 21st May, 1874, and the work commenced a few days afterwards, the Foundation Stone being laid on the 27th July, bearing the following inscription :— " This stone was laid on the 27th day of July, 1874, by James Brookeh, Esq., of Brockley Park, a Member of the Board of Works for the Lewisham District from its formation in 1856, and Chairman of its Meetings." The cost of the Building, including the land purchased for its erection, was estimated at £11,000, which sum the Metropolitan Board of Works agreed to lend at interest at £3 18s. Gd. per cent., repayable by equal annual instalments within 55 years, subject to the necessary sanction of the Treasury. The Treasury was, however, advised that the purchase of land was not a purpose contemplated by the Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1871, and their sanction was in consequence limited to the loan of £9,900, the 4 estimated cost of the Building, which sum was accord in gly advanced by the Metropolitan Board on the terms above mentioned. The sum of £1,100, the balance of the £11,000, was advanced (with the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works) by the Provident Clerks' Mutual Life Assurance Association, at £4 15s. per cent., repayable by equal annual instalments extending over 30 years. The Building is rapidly approaching completion, and, altheugh no unforeseen difficulties have been cncountercd, it is not improbable that the total cost will fall little short of £12,000. If this sum be not exceeded, and the remainder bo borrowed on the same terms and conditions as the £1,100, the total principal money will be repaid by annual sums of £250 for the next 30 years, and of £180 for the 25 years then next ensuing, and the interest payable will at the outset be £488, but this sum will of course diminish year by year, as the principal is paid off. So rapid has been the increase in wealth and importance of the Lewisham District within the last few years, that, assuming the estimates to prove correct, the annual payments will only involve a yearly charge to each ratepayer of something less than ½d. in the £ on the value of his rated property; thus a parishioner paying rates on £100 rateable value will only be called upon to pay 3s. as his annual condition towaids the new Building, and so in proportion; and to the great majority of the inhabitants, who arc rated be less than 9d. a year. The Board therefore submit that the erection of so noble a building in the midst of this district, admirably adapted for various public purposes and involving so trifling a sacrifice on the part of the inhabitants, is a subject for unqualified congratulation SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE Reference was made in the Board's last Report to the sum receivable under the Beckenham Sewerage Act, 1873, and to 5 the cost of reconstructing the Penge and Bell Green Sewer. The sum receivable was £1692 5s. 2d., exclusively of the cost of obtaining the Act (which was also paid by Beckenham), and of the permanent annual payment of ½d. in the £ on the rateable value of the Beckenham Sewerage Area; and the cost of reconstructing the Penge and Bell Green Sewer was £2,120 l1s. 7d. The equitable apportionment of these sums between Lewisham and Penge, having regard to all circumstances was a question of considerable difficulty, but it was accomplished to the satisfaction of both Parishes; and the co-operation stated to have auspiciously begun between the Bromley Guardians, as the Rural Sanitary Autherity for Beckenham, and this Hoard, has continued to give effect to the Act. During the year, the sewer, which will probably prove the most important work to be constructed under the Act for many years to come, was commenced, viz., a brick sewer, 3ft. by 2ft. and 2430ft. in length, estimated to cost £900, connecting the sewer on the Birkbeck Estate in Beckenham with the Pcnge and Bell Green Sewer of this Board, at a point near the road leading from Kent House Lane to the New Beckenham Station of the Mid Kent Railway. This work forms the trunk sewer for the Beckenham Sewerage Area; and will not only relievo Penge from nuisances, to which it has long been subjected from the adjoining Parish of Beckenham, but will also be available for the drainage of a small part of the Hamlet itself. In addition to the above, a number of minor sewers and surface water conduits and drains have been projected by Mr. Williams, on behalf of the Guardians and this Board, as works to be carried out at their joint expense. These are still under consideration by the two Boards, and their object and details are fully stated in Mr. Williams' report, appended hereto. A Bill was introduced into Parliament for this Session, (1874-5), for forming a Drainage District, to be called the West Kent Drainage District, under which a joint Sewerage 6 Board should be contituted, consisting of representatives of the Metropolitan Board of works, the Lewisham and Plumstead District Boards respectively , and the authorities representing the Parishes of Beckebham, Havyes Bromley, Mottingham, Orpington, the Crays, Bexley. East Wickham, Welling, Crayford, Erith, Dartford, &e.; cons.derablc portion of the Parish of Lewisham toward-, south-cast, and probably inclnding Southend, was intend, to be comprised in the District, and one of two main sewers to be constructed was to pass through this part of the Parish. The Bill, in a materially altered form, Passed into law ; but the proceedings of the Board in reference to it will form matter for a future report. The Sewerage works constructed exclusively for the District during the year have been of an unimportant character, and are specified in the annexed Report of the Surveyor of the Board. Some attention has, however, been paid, to the ventilation of existing sewers, 57 Sewer ventilators having been constructed in various parts of the District, and the subject is still under the consideration of the Board. HIGHWAYS. The improved condition of the Roads throughout the District, during the past few years, has been fully maintained during the last year, notwithstanding that a con- siderable eduction has been made in the quantity of material used. J The following is a repetition of the Table given in the Board's last Report, showing the various kinds of material used during the three years ended Lady-day last. material. Quantity in cubic yards. 1872-3. 1873-4. 1874-5. Granite 1,523 2,802 1,696 Bombay, China, Part Philip And other hard stone 1,055 414 160 Land picked and other flints 4,554 7,039 4,691 Croydon and other gravel 4,191 3,427 3,128 Other material ...... 713 194 Total 11,323 14,395 9,869 7 From this Table it will be seen, that altheugh the quantity of material used in the last year is very much less than in the year 1873-4, it is not much below the average for the three years ending Lady-day, 1870, and perhaps any reduction below such average ought not to be expected. Considerable as were the permancnt improvements effected in the roads and footpaths in the year ending Lady-day, 1874, there has, taking ono class of work with another, been but little abatement during the past year. In Lewisham, 5522 lineal yards of granite kerbing and channelling have been laid, against 7348 lineal yards in the previous year, while 17,321 superficial square yards of asphalte and tarpaving have been laid, against 10,446 superficial square yards in the previous year; the bulk of the works in the last year being in asphalte, instead of in the cheaper tarpaving, as in the previous year. In Pcnge, the quantity of work of each class executed during the past year, has been considerably less than in the previous year. The total quantity of each class of work in each Parish of the District is shown in the following.Table, and some further details arc given in the Surveyor's Report annexed.

Of the two special Local Improvements referred to in the Board's last Report, near the Forest Hill and Sydenham Railway Stations respectively, the first has been nearly 8 completed, and the long pending negotiations for tho other satisfactorily concluded. The Forest Hill Improvement consists in forming a new road in a direct line from the carriage bridge, under the London and Brighton Railway, a little north of the station, to Park Road, Dartmouth Park, across a piece of land purchased by the Board for the purpose. The purchase money for the land was £2000 , it comprised little more than an acre of ground, of which about 1136 square yards is appropriated to the formation of the road, and about 1303 square yards have been retained by the Board as a stone yard, or for other public purposes; ot the remainder, about 2155 square yards were resold by auction for £1470, and about 347 square yards arc proposed to be sold to the Lewisham Union Board of Guardians for £250, as a Poor Law Relief Station. The land sold, or under contract for sale, will thus realize £1720, leaving only £280 (exclusively of attendant expenses) as the cost to the Board of the land retained as a stoneyard, or for other public purposes ; this sum is so far below the value of the land that the new road may be considered as having been formed free of cost to the Parish. The Sydenham Green Improvement.—The right of Mr. E. Howard, as the owner of the Estate on the northern side of the road from the Sydenham Railway Station towards Lower Sydenham, to the open Green in front of and adJoining the Sme having been established to the satisfaction of the Board- the existence of a public Footpath over the Green, but separating it from the Estate, was made the groundsdworks for an arrangement between the Board, Mr. Howerd, and the London and Brighton Railway Company, The negociations, extending over a period of four years, resulted in an agreement executed between the parties on the 14th December, 1874, of which the following are the leading features 1. Mr. Howerd giving up a width of about 10 feet along the whole lenght of the Green belonging to him 9 (about 458 square yards), to be thrown into and made part of the main roadway, the Board using their influence to obtain an Order of Quarter Sessions for stopping up the old footpath, and at their own expense making a new kerbed and asphalted footpath on the ground given up and thrown into the roadway. 2. Mr. Howard also giving up a piece of his land, in all about 1374 square yards, on which the Railway Company arc to build a new Station on their down line. 3. The Company selling the site of the present down lino Station to the Board for £500, so as to admit of the present Bridge over the railway, now only 25 feet wide, being lowered and made 45 feet in width. 4. The Board bearing the cost of widening and forming the road, and reconstructing the bridge. The Improvement has been submitted to and approved by the Metropolitan Board, and such approval is understood to carry with it a material contribution towards the cost to be iucurrcd by the Board, but considerable time will elapse before the amount of outlay can be even approximately ascertained, and in the meantimo any further application to the Metropolitan Board is deferred. In pursuance of the agreement made between the parties, the necessary preliminaries were at once undertaken for an application to the (April, 1875) Quarter Sessions, for the stopping up of the Footpath. Of minor Improvements effected in Lewisham Parish during the year, the most important is the Footbridge Qver the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway at Sydenham Park (formerly called Park End), about midway between the Sydenham and Forest Hill Railway Stations. The important improvement contemplated in Penge, viz., the widening of the Bridge over the West End and Crystal Palace Railway in the Anerley Road, has been advanced some steps during the year. 1 he estimated cost is £1000, and the Board is still awaiting the decision of the Metropolitan Board as to the contribution to be made by them. 10 A great Improvement has been completed during the House. The Board have undertaken the future repair of the road immediately in front of this ancient hostel as a public road, and the open space of ground in front of it, which was allotted under the Penge Inelosure Award to the owner of the house, has been vested in the Boar.l, and will hereafter be maintained by them. NEW STREETS. The following "New Streets" have been paved and formed during the year, under the provisions of the 105th section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, at the cost of the owners of the property abutting on them, their future repair being undertaken by the Hoard. Lewisham. St. Stephen's Terrace. St. German's Road. St. Stephen's Road. Road at Abbott's Cottages. Brockley Place, Ladywell. Penge. Crystal Palace Station Road. The total length of the roads is 2715 feet, and the cost about £930. In addition to the above, the Board have undertaken the futuie repair oi the following old roadways in the District ^ coming under the statutory definition of " New treets, as not having been previously maintained by the 1 arish authorities:— Lewisham. Blythe Hill, Stanstead Lane Chmch Vale, Perry Vale. lavelock Mews, Forest Hill. Penge. Road near the Crooked Billet. These roads are of a total length of 1698 feet, and the cost incurred with respect to them has been about £220. 11 LIGHTING. The appointment of Mr. Heisch as Gas Examiner for the District, as mentioned in the Board's last annual Report, has been attended with important results. On his first examination of the gas of the two companies supplying the District, that of the Phoenix Company was found to contain 110 grains of sulphur per 100 cubic feet in excess of the maximum (20 grains) allowed by Act of Parliament; aud the gas of the Crystal Palace District Company 29*04 grains in excess of the maximum allowed. Proceedings were taken by the Board for the recovery of the penalties incurred by the Companies, but were not pressed, both Companies pledging themselves to do their utmost to reduce the sulphur in their gas within the statutory limits. Further details of these proceedings will be found in the annexed Report of the Medical Officer. It is admitted that the Gas Companies labour under almost insuperable difficulties in maintaining the quantity of the sulphur in the gas within the statutory limit; and it cannot be denied that the importance of the point to the gas consumer is a question on which high autherities differ. Tho first result of the Board's proceedings was therefore an application by the Phoenix Gas Company to the Board to enter into an agreement with them for reducing the standard of purity of gas under the power contained for such purpose in the 20th section of the Gas Act of 1860. The subject was referred by the Board for consideration and report by Mr. Heisch, and under his advice the Board declined to entertain the Company's proposal. A copy of the statement of facts submitted to Mr. Heisch, with the opinion of Dr. Odling and Mr. AVills, on which the Company relied, and a copy of Mr. Heisch's report, is appended to this Report. The decision of the Board necessitated renewed efforts on the part of the Companies to reduce the sulphur in their gas within the statutory limits, and such efforts have not been witheut success. In all subsequent examinations, the 12 Board have been assured that the gas has been maintained of the full illuminating power and purity, except in some cases of temporary accident. No alteration as to price has been made during the year by either Company. The Phoenix Company continuing to charge £5 for each of the Public Lamp?, the Crystal Palace District Company charging £4 3s. 4d. per lamp. There have been 34 additional lamps erected in Lewisham Parish during the year, and 9 in Penge, making a total of 1262, viz., 971 in Lewisham, and 291 in Penge. The cost of Lighting for the year has been £0096, and is fast approaching the cost of maintenance of the public roads, exclusive of watering. SANITARY. The sanitary condition of the District continues to be highly satisfactory. The number of Inhabited Houses in the District lias increased in the year from 8856 in 1873, to 9106 in 1874, viz., 6716 in Lewisham, and 2390 in Penge, and the population calculated as before at 6.15 per inhabited house, is estimated to have increased 1540 in the year, and to amount to 56,002, viz., 41,303 in Lewisham Parish, and 14,699 in Penge. The following table gives the number of Inhabited ouses and Population of the District according to the sus of 1871, and the ascertained number of Inhabited Houses and estimated Population in each of the three subsequent years. 1871. 1872. 1873. 1874.

The birth rate in London was 35.7 per 1000 for the year; in this District it was only 31.28 per 1000. The variation, year by year, is very slight, and is shown for the last five years in the following table. NUMBER AND RATE OF BIRTIIS. 1870. 1871. 1872. 1873. 1874. No. Rate. No. Rate. No. Hato.

The number of deaths and rate of mortality per 1000 for the past five years is shown by the following table. NUMBER AND RATE OF DEATHS. 1870. 1871. 1872. 1873. 1874. No. Rate. No. Bate. No. Bate. No. Bate. No. Bate. 806 17.00 816 16.29 788 14.84 791 14.52 842 15.03 By refcrenco to Table II. in the Medical Officer's Report, it will bo seen that not only is the present rate of mortality lower than the average of the previous ten years, but it has only been as low in three years of that period. Tho unprecedentedly low rate of mortality in London, for the year 1873, has been again realised for the past year, within a fraction, being in 1873 21.5 per 1000, and in 1874 21.6 per 1000. Not only is the rate of mortality in this District very favourable as compared with London, but also as compared 14 With the Metropolitan suburbs, which are designated by the Registrar General the "outer ring." In this area the rate of mortality was 16.90 per 1000, against 15.03 in this District. This result is, undoubtedly, so far satisfactory, but it is, nevertheless, essential to analyse the causes of death in the District; and the Table I, appended to this Report, affonl.s the means of comparing the number and cause of deaths in the District, and the ages at which the deaths occurred, during each of the past three years, with the per ccntage of deaths caused by each class of disease, and the per ccntage of deaths occurring in each of six selected periods of life. This Table is pregnant with matter demanding most serious consideration, and shows that there arc still 155 deaths, or 18.41 per cent. (more than one-sixth) of the whole attributed to zymotic or preventable diseases ; and of the total number of children born, 235, or considerablv more than onefourth, die off within 12 months after birth. Rut although there have been 155 deaths in all from zymotic diseases, there have been only 114 deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases, viz:— Small Pox 0 Measles 25 Scarlet Fever 6 Diphtheria Whooping Cough 25 Fever 15 Diarrhœa 39 114 this number gives a per centage to the total deaths in the District, comparing favourably with the per centage of deaths from the same diseases to the total deaths in london, also in the 18 towns specified by the Registrar General. The per centage for the District being 13.5 The per centage for London being 15 infants under one year of age is not so favourable. The per ccntagc is as follows:— In this District 27 91 In London 24 6 In the 18 towns 26.03 It will thus be seen that not only is the proportion of deaths of infants in the District greater than in London and the 18 towns, but the proportion of deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases, altheugh less than in London and the 18 towns, is not less in the same proportion as the total mortality of the District bears to the total mortality of Lon- r don, and that thus, notwithstanding very substantial grounds for congratulation, there still remains a strong incentive to continued efforts for sanitary improvement. Three Inspectors of Nuisances have been engaged throughout the year in the discharge of duties having reference to the sanitary condition of the District, and the following Table gives a summary of the work performed by them for the present and past year, as derived from the lablcs in the Medical Officers' Report for each year :— Nature of Work performed in abatement of Nuisances. 1873. 1874. Number of complaints brought under the notice of the Board 170 228 Number of bouses and premises inspected and reported on. 1062 2754 Number of houso drains repairvd, cleansed, trapped, or) ventilated 93 133 Number of privies and watercloscts repaired, cleansed, supplied with water or new ones provided 91 114 Number of new dust bins provided, and old ones repaired 147 152 Number of new water cisterns provided, and old ones re- 42 77 Number of removals of accumulation of dung and other 45 40 Number of cases of animals being improperly kept 38 16 The slaughterhouses, cowhouses, and bakehouses have been periodically inspected during the year; and the houseto-house inspection of the smaller tenements has been maintained as heretofore. 16 The Inspectors of Nuisances are also the officer appointed to procure and submit for analysis samples of artcles under the Act for preventing Adulteration of Food, Drink, &c, and during the year they have taken 82 samples for analysis by the Public Analyst. The result has been very much the same as was reported last year, viz., that in the great majority of instances the articles have been found to be either unadulterated, or but so slightly adulterated as neither to be injurious to health, or to involve any appreciable fraud on the purchaser, for, in 15 cases only was adulteration proved. FINANCE. Appended to this report is a Statement of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board for the year, and also a Statement of their Liabilities and Assets at Lady-day, 1875, both being prepared according to the form first adopted for the year 1873-4; and the following is an abstract of the sums raised and expended by the Board in the year, including the cash balances:— SUMS RAISED. SUMS EXPENDED. £ £ 1874. March 25. Cash Balance 1,073 Making, watering, and main- Rates— Training Roads. 23,429 General Rates 16,200 Dust Collecting 1,216 Do. (159 Sect.)

March 25. Cash Balance 3,966 676,036 £76,036 The greatly increased expenditure thus shown to have been made during the year,included sums amounting to £8100, paid in discharge of temporary loans,there by reducing the actual expenditure for the year from £72,070 to £63,970. 17 It will also be observed, on comparing the above statement with the similar one in the Board's last Report, that nearly one-half of the increased expenditure is due to the increase in the Precepts, both of the Metropolitan Board and the School Board for London, and a large sum has been expended for the New Offices. The Table appended to the Board's Report for the past year, for comparing the expenditure for the years 1872-3 and 1873-4 is also repeated and extended to the past year, thus affording u similar comparison between the three vears. Of tho total sum of £74,963, shown to have been received by the Board during the year, only £40,845 was raised by rate, but this sum necessitated an increase in the average rating of tho previous three years, from 3s. 10d. to 4s. 4d. in Lewisham, amd from 3s.9d.to 4s.in penge.. The amount of rates for the past year, is, however, believed to bo considerably below the average of Metropolitan Parishes. Of tho sum of £22,000, shown to have been raised by mortgage, one-half has been borrowed for the New Offices, at the joint cost of Lewisham and Penge; and the other half for paving works, of which £7,300 has been for Lewishain, and £3,700 for Penge. A Table is appended, showing tho total sums borrowed by tho Board from its constitution in 1856 to Lady-day last, amounting in all to £90,522; of this sum £34,818 has been paid off, and £55,704 only remained outstanding at Lady-day last; tho ratcable value of the District, according to the Valuation Lists in force at that time, being £418,556. The Board are therefore again enabled, unhesitatingly, to submit to the Inhabitants of the District that their Financial position is sound and healthy, and that the beneficial results of the improved condition of the District abundantly justify the increased expenditure they have necessarily incurred.

EACIIUS WILKINSON, M.D., &c., Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, It again devolves upon me, in accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 25 and 26 Vict., chap. 102, to present to you my annual report upon the sanitary state of the Lewisham District during the year 1874. In Table I., page 14, will be found the estimated population to the middle of the year 1874, the number of inhabited houses in the District at that time, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place during the year. In Table II., page 15, the annual rate of mortality per 1000 living persons, the death rates amongst children of various ages, and the per centage of deaths in public institutions during the last eleven years. In Table III., pages 16 to 21, the deaths registered at several groups of ages, from different causes during the year 1874. In Table IV., page 22, the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and the proportion to population, and to 1000 deaths in 1874. 2 In Table V., page 23, the number of deaths in the 10 years 1864-73, from the principal zymotic diseases, and the number in 1874. In Table VI., page 24, the Reports of the Inspectors of Nuisances relative to the sanitary Work effected during the In Table VIT., page 25, the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population, the number of births and deaths, with the birth and death rate in each of the Registrars subdistricts in Lewisham Parish and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising The Lewisham District. In Table VIII., page 26, the population and death rate in districts outside London; with the estimated population of the United Kingdom at the middle of 1874, and the annual rate of mortality of England and Wales. In Table IX., page 27, the population, birth and death rate in London and 20 other large towns. In Table X., page 28, the number of children between the ages of 3 and 13, attending schools under the supervision of the London School Board, with the situation of the schools. Marriages. 260 marriages took place during the year 1874 in the parish of Lewisham, of which 205 were solemnized in the several Church of England churches within the parish ; 38 in Nonconformist chapels; and 17 at the Register Office, Lewisham. 69 marriages were solemnized at the several Church of England churches at Penge, 11 in Nonconformist chapels, and 3 at the Register Office; making a total of 343 in the Lewisham district, or an increase of 14 over those of the year 1873. J Births. The registered births during the 52 weeks of the year 1874, amounted to 1752 males 902 females 850, showing a diminution of 27 on the number registered in the year 1873. the birth rate to population was 31.28 per 1000, or 3 about 1 birth to every 32 persons. The annual rate of births per 1000 in London was 35.7. For the birth rate in each Registrars sub-district, see Table VII., page 25. In England the birth rate was 35.4 per 1000. In the United Kingdom 34.5 per 1000. The birth rate in 21 large towns was 37 2, sec Table IX., page 27. Mortality. The number of deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1874 was 842; of this number the deaths amongst males were 451, amongst females 391. Notwithstanding the increase of population, the mortality, although a little higher than that of 1873, was below the average of the last 10 years; and whilst the rate of mortality in 1804 was 18.76, that of 1874 was only 15.03 per 1000—an exceedingly low rate. The annual rate of mortality in London was 21 .G per 1000—1 in the outer ring, and 22.6 in the inner London. The mortality was below 18 per 1000 in Rochester, Dover and Cheltenham; it was 32 in Stockport, 32 in Asliton-under-Lyne, 32 in Merthyr Tydvil, 36 in Preston, and 37 in Wigan. The death rate in 21 large towns amounted to 20 4 per 1000. The death rate for England and Wales was 22.27 per 1000 By reference to Table III, page 16, which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be seen that of the 842 deaths from all causes during the year 1874, 235, or nearly 28 per cent. (27.90) died under one year of age, and 99 between the ages of 1 and 5; so that 334 children, or nearly 40 per cent. (39.70) of the whole number of deaths were of children under the age of 5 years. 235 deaths took place under 1 year. 50 between the ages of 1 and 2. 43 „ „ „ 2 „ 5. 29 „ „ „ 5 ,, 15. 4 39 between the ages of 15 and 25. 52 „ „ „ 25 „ 35. 68 „ „ „ 35 ,, 45. 68 „ „ 45 ,, 55. 93 „ „ „ 55 „ 05. 106 „ „ „ 65 it ~5. 48 „ „ „ 75 „ 85. 4 „ „ „ 85 „ 95. 1 „ „ „ above 95.

Preventable Diseases. Six of the seven principal zymotic diseases, viz., measles, scarlet fever, diptheria, whooping cough, different forms of fever, and diarrhoea occasioned 114 deaths, a number considerably below the average of 10 years, 132.1, and less during the year 1874 than in any year, except 1805 and 1873, when 96 and 85 deaths were registered respectively from these causes. The annual average number of deaths in London from these diseases, during the same 10 years, having been 196.61, and in the whole of England and Wales 182.52 per 1000. Small-pox.—As during the year 1873, so this year, 1874, no deaths were registered from small-pox. This is greatly to be attributed to the vigilant manner in which the provisions of the Vaccination Act are enforced by the Boards of Guardians of the Lewisham and Croydon Unions, with the aid of most efficient Vaccination Officers. Mr. Atkins, the Vaccination Officer of the Lewisham Parish, informs me that during the year 1874, 1,181 children were successfully vaccinated, and that after deducting for deaths of infants and certificates of insusceptibility to the 5 disease, the whole of the children born, with the exception of two or three were vaccinated. 340 children were vaccinated in Penge. Measles.—25 deaths have occurred from measles, the annual average of 10 years bcin^ 14. The largest mortality from this cause was in the year 1868, when 34 deaths occurred, and in 1871, when 26 deaths were registered. Scarlei Fever.—Scarlet fever was more or less prevalent during the year, notwithstanding which the deaths caused by this disease only amounted to (3, a number less than that of last year, when 10 only were registered, and considerably below the average of 10 years, viz., 33.1. Diptheria.—Diptheria occasioned 4 deaths, the average of 10 years being, 9.2 per annum. Whooping Cough.—25 deaths took place from whooping cough, the average rate of 10 years being 19.6. Fever.—The annual average number of deaths for 10 years from the different forms of fever is 18.7. 15 have been registered from this cause in 1874, viz.:— 1 from typhus, the highly contagious fever of starvation and overcrowding. 11 from typhoid or gastric fever, the fever produced by the inhalation of poisonous gases, or by the ingestion of poisonous germs conveyed in water, milk, &c. 1 from simple continued fever. 1 from remittent fever, and 1 from intermittent fever, or ague, a disease almost unknown in these elevated districts. Diarrhœa.—The annual average rate of mortality in the previous 10 years was 30.7. During the year 1874, 39 deaths were registered, the largest mortality from it in this district .since 1870, when 48 deaths were registered from the same cause. Seven Principal Zymotic Diseases.—In London during the year 1874, 11,220 deaths, and in England and Wales 85,094 were registered from these diseases. 6 The proportion of death, from zymotic disease to 1,000 deaths from all canses, having been in tins this Districit 36.40 Ditto ditto m London 146.46 Ditto ditto in England and Wales . 161.66 The proportion of deaths from zymotic diseases to population in this district has been in 1.74 2.03 per 1,000. Thus only 2.03 individuals out of every 1,000 have died from these diseases during the year. Pulmonary Diseases (not Phthisis).—157 deaths, a less number than that registered last year, were attributed to pulmonary diseases (other than phthisis); ol whuh 88 (beside other pulmonary diseases) were attributed to bronchitis, and 53 to pneumonia; 3.04 in every 1,000 died from pulmonary diseases, and out of 1,000 deaths from all causes, 180.46 were caused by these diseases. Tubercular Diseases.—124 persons or 2.21 in every 1,000 died from phthisis, scrofula, rickets, and tabes, or ol 1,000 deaths 147-26 were attributed to these diseases. Wasting Diseases of Infants.—74 or 1.32 per 1,000 population died from marasmus, atrophy, debility, want of breast milk, and premature birth. Out of every 1,000 deaths 87.88 were attributed to these causes. Convulsive Diseases of Infants, including hydrocephalus, infantile meningitis, convulsions, and teething, were fatal to 57 children, or 1.01 of the population. 67'70 out of every 1,000 deaths were attributed to these causes. PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. School Board Schools. During the year 1874 the number of children upon the roll in the Lewisham district amounted to 5,799. Of these ')•)() did not attend in consequence of sickness, or from being consideied by their parents too young, &c., and 11 were permanent absentees in consequence of be ing deaf and dumb, &c. The highest attendance at the various schools in any one day amounted to 4,471, and the average attendance was 3,705. Amongst such a large number of children sickness must 7 frequently occur, and it appears that during the year a great number of children were absent from this cause. It is most important that schools should not be allowed to be a means of spreading disease, by receiving children affected with contagious diseases, or by admitting them too speedily after their apparent recovery, and it is satisfactory to know that children are not re-admitted to school after having had contagious diseases without a certificate from the medical man who has had such cases in charge, that recovery has taken place, and that there is no danger of communicating such diseases to the healthy. Hut what a vast additional instrument for good the School Hoard might become if children were instructed in that most desirable of all information the means of preventing the causes and the spread of disease, if they were taught to fear the danger of want of personal cleanliness (of which many of them are the constant witnesses), the disadvantages and poison of intemperance; the danger of overcrowding, the necessity for pure water and pure air; in fact, if that sanitary knowledge which the poorer classes especially require were instilled into the plastic minds of young children. It strikes me that future generations would reap incalculable benefit from such a course, and upon the method of teaching in these schools will depend much of the future sanitary progress of the country. A large quantity of nutritious provision is annually wasted amongst all classes in this country by careless and wasteful manipulation in the process of cooking, and by the rejection of articles of food which, if properly used, might afford nourishment in the form of soup or otherwise. The cost of meat supply is rendered greater to all classes by the purchase of what are called "prime joints," whilst other parts of the same animal, which are not known to most householders by name, are termed inferior, but would afford an equal amount of nutriment if carefully and tastefully prepared. Trades and arts are usually acquired by careful training under the instruction of skilled masters, but no instruction is 8 usually given in the art of preparing food in the most economical and healthful manner, other than by mistresses who, from having paid little or no attention to such matters themselves, are incompetent to teach, and cooking is commonly learned haphazard, at a large and constant cost lor waste in private families; but the evil does not end here, tor these same servants are by-and-bye married, and have probably to bring up families, and the same incompetence and wakefulness leads up to the formation of a miserable home, insufficient supply of nourishment, and unhealthy progeny. The first necessity to overcome this difficulty would be to procure good teachers, and facilities are now offered by the National Training School for Cookery, where, by a comparatively small subscription of a few pounds, a person may be so instructed as to become a certified teacher, competent to instruct in the art of cookery for all classes. These teachers should commence by teaching what to buy and how to cook for those with the humblest means, when they can afterwards extend their instruction to more advanced cookery. North Surrey District School. This School receives pauper children from the parishes of Chelsea, Croydon, Kensington, Lewisham, Richmond, and Wandsworth and Clapham. The average number of inmates in the School is about 767, a considerably smaller number than was accommodated some years ago. the aveage cost ol each child to the different parishes varies accoiding to the rateable value of each parish and the number of children sent from each parish, thus the cost to Richmond is about £38 per annum per head, to the Lewisham Union about £42 per head, and to the Croydon Union, including Penge, about £27 per head per annum. The School has been considerably enlarged, and a smaller number of children being accommodated it is necessarily much less overcrowded. 9 The drainage has been remodelled, and the drains ventilated and cut off from all connection with the interior of the building, after the plan originally adopted at the Infirmary. New reception and probationary wards have been erected. The Schoolroom and dormitories have been ventilated, the old windows removed, and sash windows provided. All cases of contagious diseases are sent away immediately to a Fever Hospital. The practice of admitting sick children has been discontinued, and none are now allowed to enter the School. Under these circumstances, the School, which always was healthy, must necessarily continue to be so, and only one death was registered ; s having taken place within the School during the year. Union Workhouses. The average resident population of the Lewisham Union Workhouse during the year 1874 was 170. The number of paupers who passed through the establishment numbered 783, besides the reception of 3,841 vagrants. 11 births took place (10 of which were illegitimate) and 39 deaths, 13 of which occurrcd to non-parishioners. Penge is within the Croydon Union, but contributed only 01 inmates to the Croydon Workhouse. The Board's Hospital. Six cases were admitted during the year to the Board's Hospital, at Hither Green, and were all discharged cured, viz.:— Female, 27, typhoid fever; female, 13, scarlet fever; female, 10, scarlet fever; female, 20, scarlet fever; female, 38, roseola; male, 40, smallpox. It has been determined by the Board that whenever space permits cases from neighbouring districts should be admitted to the Hospital, upon their complying with the rules of thelnstitution and paying for board and necessary medical attendance. 10 Water Supply. The Act of 1871 makes it incumbent upon the Com panics to give constant supply as and when the public anthoritiee may see fit to require The two Companies which supply this District are the Kent and the Lambeth Companies. The Kent Company are giving a constant supply in a portion of their district. The water supplied by this Company is taken from chalk wells, and is invariably cleai and bright. The Lambeth Company obtain their supply from the River Thames, and although every care with the filtering appears to be taken, the water must, from the souice of the supply, be more or less turbid after heavy rainfall; but the new works are completed at Moulsey, and the large impounding reservoir will tend to make the supply more pure. The purity of water, however, does not entirely depend upon the source of supply. Major Bolton, in his reports upon water supply, calls attention to a most important point which I have frequently mentioned to the Board, namely, the filthy state of cisterns. He says " that the contamination of water from the gases generated by sewage is of more frequent occurrence than is generally understood. The gases are extremely liable to flow back into the cisterns and become absorbed by the water, unless the overflow pipe is brought outside the house and the end exposed to the air, instead of being carried into the drain. " The attention of all householders ought to be given to their cisterns, which should frequently be cleaned out, more especially after periods of flood or turbidity, and every care should be taken to prevent the contamination of the domestic water supply." Gas Supply. Mr. Heisch, the gas examiner to the Lewisham Board of Works, has from time to time examined and reported upon the quality ol the gas supplied by the Phoenix and Crystal Palace Companies. 11 The illuminating power of that supplied by both Companies has been generally found to be above the standard, but the sulphur compounds were at first greatly in excess of the maximum quantity allowed by Act of Parliament, being in the case of the Phoenix Company 31.5 per 100 feet, and of the Crystal Palace District Gas Company 49.04 per 100 feet. Sulphur compounds when burnt in dwelling-houses are deleterious, and give rise to gases which irritate the lungs, and tend to injure books, furniture, &e., therefore the Act prescribes that the maximum quantity of sulphur should not exceed 20 grains per 100 feet. These sulphur compounds, however, are difficult to remove without expense; and without great care most offensive nuisances may arise from the process for their removal. Both Companies were summoned to the Greenwich Police Court, and in the case of the Crystal Palace District Gas Company a nominal fine of 1s. and costs was imposed, and upon the Phcenix Company undertaking to do their best to remove cause of complaint the summons was withdrawn. There was a most offensive nuisance in November last, for several days, causing great alarm in the neighbourhood of St. Germain's-road, Catford, and Lewisham, it was occasioned by large volumes of sulphuretted hydrogen gas which escaped from the sewer in the night, and were traced along the Ravensbourne and Sydenham main sewer, in the Bromley and Lewisham Road, from the turning to Ladywell to the Black Horse public house, Rushey Green, and from thence along: the Catford road to the Crystal Palace Gas Works, Bell Green. This gas entered the houses along the lines of sewers through the sink traps and pipes, and discoloured the white paint in many houses and turned the silver black, and some of the inhabitants had to turn out into the streets. As soon as this disgusting: nuisance was traced to its sourco proceedings were taken to stop it, both by the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Lewisham District Board of 12 Works, against the Crystal Palace Gas Company. The directors of the Company denied that anything had been done at their works to cause a nuisance; but upon being served with notice of the Lewisham Board's intention to apply to the Court of Chancery, the nuisance immediately ceased, and on the hearing of a summons, issued by the Metropolitan Board against the Company, the Magistrate inflicted a fine upon the Crystal Palace District Gas Company of 40s. and costs. Ventilation of Sewers, Cesspools, and Drains. The ventilation of sewers is of great importance, us from the general construction of house drains, sinks, and waste pipes, if these ventilators did not exist, sewer air would necessarily be forced into dwelling houses; and this would be more especially the case when unventilated houses were warmed and the air within them thus rarefied If, however, this is important as regards sewers, it is of equal or greater importance as regards cesspools, and no householder should allow an unventilated cesspool to remain upon his premises. The best method of ventilating house drains, and the one which this Board has adopted and ordered to be applied to all new houses in the district, is to have the main drains ventilated by a pipe carried up a sufficient distance above the roof and out of the reach of windows, and into this pipe all waterclosets should open. This pipe should be bent at the top, or provided with a "Banner" cowl to prevent accidental stoppage, by birds, &c., and at the same time create draught. 1 he larger the pipe is the more useful it would be, and the diameter should not be less than 3 or 4 inches. It this plan were always adopted and fitted to every building, ventilating openings to sewers would probably become down shafts for the entrance of fresh air, and the ventilating pipes to house drains would form up shafts for the exit of foul air. 13 The pipes from sinks, overflow pipes from cisterns, the pipes from baths and lavatories should never be made to enter the druin, and thus form chimneys to the sewer. They should terminate freely in the open air, and discharge their contents into a trapped gully hole outside the house, in which case the pipes will not become stopped, and fresh air can only be admitted through them into the house. The dischargo of a small quantity of carbolic acid from every house would also prevent putrefactive fermentation occurring in sewers, and further prevent nuisances dangerous to health. Ventilation of Houses. Each room in a dwelling-house should be supplied with a ventilator opening into the fresh air, which should never be closed, but which may be covered with a piece of muslin to distribute the air if draughts should be felt in the winter. The ordinary outlets of the room will possibly be sufficient for the exit of foul, heated, or used-up air, but an Arnott's ventilator into the chimney, or a foul air flue built from the corner of the room to a distance above the roof, renders the ventilation more perfect. j Disinfecting Apparatus. A disinfecting apparatus has been purchased by the Board, and will be shortly erected in some convenient part of the district, where it will be available for public use as a disinfectant of wearing apparel, bedding, &c. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON To the Board of Works for the Lewisham District. 14 TABLE 1. Population, Inhabited Houses, Births, Deaths, and Marriages.

Gentlemen, I I beg to submit my sixth Annual Report upon work carried out in my department during the past year. HIGHWAYS. The following material was used in the maintenance of the Highways. Division. Granite. Granite Spalls. Port Philip. I and Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Croydon Gravel. Perry Hill Gravel. Rushey Green Gravel. Hard Core. Total. Lewisham, cubic yards 1396 200 160 1328 2422 692 242 677 194 7311 Penge, cubic yards 100 … … 941 … 1517 … … … 2558 Total 1496 200 160 2269 2422 2209 242 677 194 9869 A much smaller quantity of material has been used than last year. The roads are in good condition and are improving. In the maintenance of the principal roads of the district I am gradually substituting granite for broken flints. The whole of the roads in Sydenham Park have been coated with granite during the year, also portions of the London Road, Forest Hill, and the Anerley Road, Penge. I consider slopping a very important part of the maintenance of roads, particularly in populous places. Those who have resided in the District for some time must have noticed a gradual improvement in this direction. At present I have nine slop carts for use in Lewisham, and one for use in Penge. This number is often insufficient to remove the slop as quickly as I should wish. In wet weather, to have the slops removed as fast 30 as I can sweep the roads with a sweeping machine, I should require ten carts to each machine. Twenty-one new gullies were constructed in Lewisham, and nine in the Hamlet of Penge. Some of the roads at present are not well drained, but in a large district like Lewisham such improvements must necessarily be carried out by degrees, on account of the large outlay it would involve to cany out the work at once. The total cost of the Highways in Lewisham, including gullies, &c., during the year, was £7,876 and in Penge it was £1,638, The rainfall during the year, from the 26th March, 1874, to the 25th March, 1875 (inclusive), was as follows:— Inches. 1874. March .100 April 1.120 May 1.150 June 4.400 July .720 August 6.000 September 1.990 October 5.590 November 1.570 December 1.510 1875. January 3.050 February .790 March .400 28.390 Rain fell upon 129 days, and the rainfall was 8.210 inches more than the corresponding period last year. ROAD WATERING. The watering of the roads in Blackheath and the greater Portion of Lewisham Parish was done by the Board's horses and men. In Sydenham and Forest Hill, Mr. William Stimpson supplied horses and men at a contract price of 8s. 3d. per day. In the hamlet of Penge Mr. Winnifrith supplied horses and men at a contract price of 7s 9d. per day. The cost of the watering 31 in Lewisham during the year was £2,158, and in the Hamlet of Penge £680. During the hot weather the supply of water from the Lambeth Water Company was deficient, particularly at Perry Hill, Church Road, Forest Hill, &c. The whole of the stand posts are now fitted with swan-neck pipes. One of Bailey's Hydrostatic Vans was purchased and did good service in Lewisham. These vans are nothing more than large water carts with improved distributors. The chief advantage attached to them is, ill their holding about 500 gallons of water, and thereby reducing the time lost in going over the road with an empty water cart. Some of the water carts are old, and new ones will soon have to be purchased in place of them. There were 27$ miles of road watered in Lewisham, and 8 miles in Penge, during the year, being an increase on last year's watering. LIGHTING. There are at present 540 lamps in the Parish of Lewisham lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, at a contract price of £4 3s. 4d. per lamp per annum, and 433 lighted by the Phoenix Gas Company, at a contract price of £5 per lamp per annum. In the Hamlet of Penge there arc 291 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, at a contract price of £4 3s. 4d. per lamp per annum. The following gives the additional lamps erected during the year in the district. Lewisham.

The roadway is 45 feet between fences; it has been well 36 bottomed with bushes and chalk. I was engaged in making detail drawings of girders for widening the Railway Bridges, near Sydenham Station, and near Hamlet Terrace, in the Anerley Road, Penge. I obtained the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works to my drawings. In the case of the Sydenham Railway Bridge, a difficulty presented itself on account of the little depth available for the girders, which necessitated an extravagant section of girder. The Bridge as designed will consist of eight new longitudinal girders. I have made use of the two old girders. The roadway will be 45 feet wide between parapets, and carried upon brick arches. Widening the Railway Bridge near Hamlet Terrace is a more simple matter. The design consists in adding two footways to the present bridge. I also made the detail drawings for the new footbridge across the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway at Park End, Sydenham. The contract for the ironwork was let to Messrs. Head, Williams, & Co., and for the stonework, brickwork, and timberwork to Mr. Amer, of Perry Hill. The bridge consists of two wrought iron lattice girders resting upon two brickwork piers, the footway being pitch pine planking. The Bridge has, I believe, given great satisfaction; it has alight appearance, and will be most convenient to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. A small road improvement was carried out at the bottom of Granville Park, Lewisham; also near Clarke's Lane, Perry Hill, and near the Rutland Tavern, Perry Hill. The road near the Deptford boundary, Brockley Lane, was also widened. A very great improvement was effectcd by planting the triangular piece of ground at the Crooked Billet, Dulwich Road, Penge. This piece of ground was a great nuisance before the Board purchased it. I prepared plans of a road improvement near the Wynell Road, Perry Yale. The following Table will show the improvements carried out liming the year, also those projected but not carried out. 37 IMPROVEMENT. remarks. LEWISHAM. New Road near Forest Hill Station Road made.

We have now a good Stone Yard at Forest Hill, but it is quite open at present. It should be enclosed. The re-construction of Hocum Pocum Bridge was commenced during the year; I made the necessary drawings, and obtained the sanction of the Plumstead Board, and am now carrying them out. Drawings were prepared for the road improvement near the Railway Bridges, Dulwich Road, Penge. The work has been carried out. Drawings were also made for improving the Park Road approach to the New Road near Forest Hill Station. NEW STREETS.

DUSTING. The cost of collecting dust, ashes, &c., in the Parish of Lewis- win was £986 15s. 11d., and the sale of dust amounted to £201 9s. 9d. In Lewisham the Board employed their own men and boys, * The footpath only on the North side including kerbing and channelling of this road was made up by the Board. 39 and contracted for the supply of horses and carts. There were 5814 loads of dust, &c., collected during the year. The contractors for the supply of horses were Mrs. Grant, Lewisham, and Mr. Jewkes, Lower Sydenham. In Penge the dust, &c., was collected under contract with Mr. "William Fuller, and cost £201. The Board have resolved to do the work themselves as in Lewisham next year. SEWERAGE.

On the 22nd October (Min., p. 275, par. 33), I reported to the Board that I found the invert of the Stanstead Lane Sewer from the "Raven" public house, Catford, to the "Telegraph" public house, Forest Hill, very defective. The sewer is egg shaped, 3 feet 9 inches by 2 feet 3 inches. On account of the great expense of re-construction I determined to make the attempt to cut the defective portions out, and make such good without stopping the working of the sewer. The work is being carried out at night, and I have every reason to believe will be brought to a successful issue. At the present time there are several parts of the district without an outfall sewer, viz., the Southend Road from Rushey Green to the boundaries with Bromley and Beckenham, Brockley Lane from the boundary with Deptford to the "Chandos Arms" Public House. There is a large estate now being laid out near the Deptford boundary. There is not a sewer in part of Peckham Road and Sydenham Hill. We have not a sewer in the valley from Hocum Pocum Bridge, near Weardale Road, Lee, to our boundary. There is a large number of houses in Nightingale Grove and Maythorn Cottages drained into cesspools in this neighbourhood. The West Kent Drainage Scheme was projected during the year (see my Report, Min., p. 311, par. 21). The Crystal Palace District Gas Company gave a great deal of trouble by allowing gas refuse to flow into the sewers. By a resolution of the Board I received instructions to correct the 25-inch Ordnance Map of the Parish up to the present time; this is a large work and entails a great deal of labour. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, JOHN CARLINE, Civil Engineer, Surveyor to the Board. To the Board of Works for the Lewisham District. THE BOARD OF WORKS for The Lewisham District. STATEMENT OF THE QUESTION raised by THE PHœNIX GAS COMPANY as to THE STANDARD OF PURITY OF THE GAS TO BE SUPPLIED BY THEM IN THE LEWISHAM DISTRICT, and REPORT thereon by CHARLES HELSCH, Esq., Superintending Gas Examiner for the City of London. PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE BOARD. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. STATEMENT OF QUESTION. Grove Place, Lewisham, 21st October, 1874. Mr. Heisch is requested to report to the Board on a question which has arisen between them and the Phoenix Gas Company; and which may be shortly stated as follows:— Whether the Board may be reasonably required—having regard as well to the interests of the public in the vicinity of the Company's Gas Works supplying this District, as to that of the gas consumers within the District—to agree with the Company upon any other or different test by which to ascertain the purity of the gas, or to vary the amount of ammonia or sulphur in any form in pursuance of the provisions of the 25th Sec. of the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860.* The circumstances under which the question has arisen are as follows, and although the question at issue is not anywhere precisely stated (see the Company's letter of 30th July, as quoted on the Board's Minutes), it is assumed to be whether the amount of sulphur should be allowed to be increased from the maximum prescribed by the Act above-mentioned, viz.:— 20 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas. † Mr. Heisch reported to the Board on the 5th May, 1874, that the quality of the gas supplied by the Company on that day was as follows:— Illuminating power - - - 16 candles Sulphuretted Hydrogen - - None Ammonia ------ None Sulphur, on 5th and 6th - - 31.5 grains in 100 cubic feet * Note.—See Appendix, page 29, for copy Section. † The Report referred to was made by Mr. Heisch in his capacity as Gas Examiner for the Lewisham District, to which office he was appointed on the 12th February, 1874. 4 The Report was laid before the Hoard at their meeting on the 21st May, when they resolved that a copy of it should be forwarded to the Company, with a request to them to make such observations thereon as they might desire. On the 18th June, a letter from the Company was submitted to the Board acknowledging the receipt of the Board's letter with a copy of the Gas Examiner's report, and expressing the Company's thanks for the same, but being altogether silent as to the exccss of sulphur found in their gas beyond the maximum allowed by the Act; the Board, therefore, resolved that in the absence of any explanation by the Company of the impurity of their gas, proceedings be taken against them for the recovery of the penalty incurred. A summons was accordingly issued against the Company, which brought the letter from the Secretary of the 25th June (see below). In view of the summons, Mr. Heisch made a further examination of the gas supplied. The following is the entry on the Minutes of the Board of 2nd July. as to letter from the Company and second examination of gas. "The Clerk reported the issue of a summons and the receipt of a letter from the Company (25th June) stating that he had submitted to the Directors the letter communicating the resolution ot this Board at their last Meeting, and in reply giving his assurance that every effort was being made to reduce the sulphur compounds to the lowest possible per centage which the existing apparatus could effect, and that the Directors would be happy if a Committee of this Board would favor them with a visit to their Works at Greenwich, from which the Parish of Lewisham was supplied, where the whole apparatus and means adopted for extracting the sulphur would be explained. ” that the Directors admitted the possibility of Keeping the quantity of sulphur within the prescribed maximum of 20 grains, but it was feared it could only be done by a most costly re-arrangement of the existing plant, and the Directors were anxious to avoid an outlay which might 5 necessitate an increase in the price of gas; and reminding this Board that practically the difference between the 20 grains of sulphur permitted and the quantity the gas usually contained was in effect of the most insignificant importance; and stating that the Company's Engineer was specially engaged in bringing, if possible, the quantity within the prescribed limits, and it was hoped with some chance of success; and stating that the Directors trusted the explanation given would so far satisfy this Board as to induce them to withhold resorting to any hostile proceedings, adding that the Directors had no idea a reply to this particular point of the Board's letter was expected, or the present explanation would have been at once given. "The Clerk further reported that he had deemed it desirable as affecting the issue of the summonses, that a further examination of the gas supplied by the Company should be made, and had requested such an examination to be made accordingly." The Board approved the proceedings which had been taken, and directed that the summons should be prosecuted. The following is a copy of Mr. Heisch's report on his second examination of the Company's gas:— Report on the quality of the Gas supplied by the Phoenix Gas Company, July 1st, 1874. Illuminating power - - - 16.85 candles. Sulphuretted hydrogen - 0.0 Ammonia ------ 0.0 Sulphur, July 1st and 2nd, per 100 cubic feet - - - 16.7 grains. On the hearing of the summons, the Magistrate, having regard to the endeavours which were being made by the Company to reduce the quantity of sulphur in the gas, and to Mr. Heisch's second report, showing that a considerable reduction had been effected, expressed a strong opinion that the proceedings ought not to be further prosecuted, and in deference to such opinion, the summons was withdrawn. 6 At such hearing reference was made to the provisions of the 25th Sec. of the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, enabling Local Authorities and Gas Companies to agree for varying the amount of sulphur in any form from the standard fixed by the Act. And a letter was some time afterwards received from the Secretary of the Company on the point, as to which the following is the entry on the Board's Minutes of the 13th August, 1874:— "Read a letter (30th July) from the Secretary of the Phoenix Gas Company referring to the withdrawal of the summons recently issued against the Company on the complaint of this Board of the quality of gas supplied by them, and stating that he was desired by the Board of Directors to express their readiness to discuss the question with a view to arriving at an agreement thereon, as provided by Sec. 25 of the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860. "Resolved that the Secretary of the Company be informed that this Board are not aware of any circumstance rendering it desirable to have recourse to the provisions of the section referred to enabling them and the Company to enter into an agreement on the subject of the quality of gas to be supplied, and that without declining such a conference as suggested, the Company be requested in the first instance to furnish this Board with a statement of the grounds upon which they seek to alter the quality of the gas, as expressly enacted by the Section mentioned." This resolution resulted in the receipt of a further letter from the Secretary of the Company, as to which the following is the entry on the Board's Minutes of the 24th September, 1874. "Read a letter from the Phoenix Gas Company, of which the following is a copy:— The Phoenix Gas Light and Coke Company, 70, Bankside, S.E., August 20, 1874. Dear Sir, Bi-Sulphide of Carbon. I submitted your letter of the 14th inst. to the Board 7 of Directors, and I am directed to state in continuation of our letter of the 25th June last, that the Directors find that the hopes therein expressed have not been fulfilled. As stated, every effort has been made to reduce the sulphur to the lowest per centage, and temporarily with success, but after a while the eccentric variations again occurred, and it may now be fairly admitted that the certainty of eliminating this compound can only be effected by a costly re-arrangement of plant, and the creation of a terrible nuisance in the neighbourhood, from which the adjacent Parish of Greenwich would be the greatest sufferers. In juxtaposition with this state of things, the Directors wish to place the opinions of the most eminent chemists as to the real character of the compound now under discussion. (Copies arc sent herewith.) From these opinions it will be seen that there is really nothing in the question which need cause the Local Board any anxiety, nor induce them to take anv further action in respect to it. The Clause of the Act of 1860 restricting the quantity of sulphur to 20 grains has never before been acted upon, and is practically obsolete.* I am, &c., I. A. CROOKENDEN, Sand. Edwards, Esq., Secretary. Board of Works, Lewisham. "The Clerk then stated that the opinions sent were those of Dr. Odling, Mr. Thos. Wm. Keates, Consulting Chemist to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and Mr. Thos. Wills, Lecturer upon Chemistry at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich ; and that as regarded Dr. Odling, the statement of opinion sent appeared to have been made in a Lecture delivered by him to the Metropolitan Association of Medical * Note.—In the Appendix, page 28, is an extract from a Report to the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, explaining why the Clause is "practically obsolete" within their jurisdiction. 8 Officers of Health, in February, 1869; but as regarded Mr. Keates' and Mr. Wills' opinions, it did not appear when or under what circumstances they had been expressed, and the statements sent were obviously merely extracts. "Resolved that previously to the consideration of the question raised by the Company, their Secretary be requested to inform the Board at what dates, and under what circumstances the opinions furnished had been expressed, and to refer the Board to any complete published reports of the same, and that upon the required information being furnished, the subject be referred to Mr. Heisch, as Gas Examiner of the Board, for report thereon to them." On a communication being made to the Secretary, in accordance with the resolution, the further correspondence took place between him and the Clerk to the Board, of which the following is a copy :— Phœnix Gas Coy., 70, Bankside, Oct. 5th, 1874. Dear Sir, In reply to your letter of the 29th ult., I have pleasure in furnishing you herewith the full report of Dr. Odling's Lecture, from which our extracts were made. You will find it on page 81 of the Gas Journal, of Feb. 2, 1869.* The opinions of Mr. Keates and Mr. Wills were furnished to the Board upon the Directors' request, as the outline of evidence to be given at trial in July last, and do not appear in any printed form.

Copy Document Referred to forwarded by the Company to the Board on the 20th August, 1874. Dr. Odling, in his lecture delivered to the Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health, says : * "Now let us consider the injurious effects likely to arise from the sulphurous acid so produced. The Act of Parliament says that coal gas shall not contain more than 20 grains of sulphur absolutely, and we find that—estimating it from the amount of sulphurous acid produced—it does not contain more than that quantity, although, estimating it according to the absolute amount of sulphur, it does contain more. What is the absolute amount ordinarily contained in coal gas I cannot tell you, although it certainly exceeds 20, and I believe even 25 grains in the 100 cubic feet; but we will make a very liberal assumption. "We will assume that coal gas habitually contains 40 grains of sulphur in 100 cubic feet, and then consider how much sulphurous acid that amount of sulphur will produce. Sulphurous acid consists ot exactly half its weight of sulphur, therefore, if the whole of these 40 grains were completely burnt, we should have 80 grains of sulphurous acid, but in reality a proportion of the 40 grains would not e so burnt. This 80 grains of sulphurous acid gas, owever, corresponds to a little over the l-15th part of a cubic foot, so that as 100 of gas, on the assumption we have made would yield us l-15th of a cubic foot, 1,500 feet of coal gas would be required to yield us one cubic foot of sulphurous acid; but when we burn 1,500 feet of coal gas we produce something also besides sulphurous acid— * Note.- Dr. Odling's Lecture here quoted was delivered in January, 1869 In th Appendix, p. 22, a further part of it is given, affecting the question of Sulpur, not included in the Extract furnished by the Company. 11 the carbon and other constituents furnish their products to the atmosphere—our 1,500 cubic feet of coal gas required to produce one cubic foot of sulphurous acid, would, at the same time, produce some 1,000 cubic feet of carbonic acid; and, in addition to other far more abundant sources of dilution, the sulphurous acid would be diluted with 1,000 times its volume of carbonic acid. Accordingly, if you could measure the proportion of carbonic acid gas in a room lighted by coal gas, and take the 1,000th part of that proportion, you might form some idea of the proportion of sulphurous acid gas existing in the room. The highest result obtained by Professor Roscoe, as I have told you, amounted to .32 per cent. of carbonic acid, but how much of that was produced by the gas burnt, and how much by tho respiration of the persons present at the Theatre, I cannot tell you; but you may form some notion of it by referring to the results of other experiments made in crowded sleeping rooms with the windows shut, and also in some barracks. In these cases the proportion of carbonic acid, where no gas was burning, approximated very closely to the amount found in the gallery of the Theatre, where it was furnished alike by the breaths of the individuals and the combustion of the gas. " Moreover, we can form some notion of it another way- Speaking in round numbers again, every one of us produces about two-thirds of a cubic foot of carbonic acid an hour, which is the amount of carbonic acid gas that would be produced by the combustion of one foot of coal gas, so that every three individuals produce about as much as would be produced by one burner burning 3 feet an hour. I think we may take it for granted, therefore, that this .32 per cent. found by Dr. Roscoe, was contributed as largely by the individuals present as by the gas. We will assume, however, that of the proportion found by Dr. Roscoe 0.2, or nearly two-thirds of the whole, was produced by the combustion of the gas, and the remainder by the breaths of the people present. 12 "Assuming then that the atmosphere acquired 0.2, or onefifth of a per cent, of carbonic acid, by the combustion of gas, and on our original basis, that the sulphurous acid produced amounts to the 1,000th part of the carbonic acid, we should have present in the air of the room, 1-000,000th—or a halfmillionth—part of sulphurous acid: a proportion utterly insignificant. Further, to produce a cubic foot of sulphurous acid would require an hour's combustion of 300 burners consuming 5 feet of gas apiece; while to have a cubic foot of sulphurous acid existing at any moment in the air of any room, of whatever size, would necessarily require a much more abundant gas consumption, owing to the great change of atmosphere taking place every moment, even in the worst ventilated room."* Mr. Thomas William Keates, Consulting Chemist to the Metropolitan Board of Works, says:— He has given great attention to the subject of gas and its chemical compounds. Sulphur is one of these, and is the most difficult of all to eliminate from the gas. He is aware that under the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, 20 grains per 100 cubic feet was the maximum Companies were permitted to allow. He does not consider that the public are practically any sufferers by a certain excess of this limit; the following are his reasons:—Twenty grains of sulphur produce when burned 40 grains of sulphurous acid, which in bulk rather equal more than 58 cubic inches; so that 100 cubic feet of gas containing 20 grains of sulphur produce in burning 58 cubic inches of sulphurous acid gas. An ordinary fish-tail gas burner consumes about 4 cubic feet of gas per hour, * Note.—For the further part of Dr. Odling's Lectire immediately follow ing the part extracted by the Company, see Appendix, p. 24; and at p. 25 of the Appendix is given an Extract from the remarks made by Dr. Letheby in the discussion which followed Dr. Odling's Lecture. 13 consequently, in a long evening, say 6 to 12, it would consume 24 feet of gas. Two such burners afford light sufficient for a good-sized room, and would consume 48 cubic feet of gas in six hours, producing in the atmosphere of such a room nearly 28 cubic inches of sulphurous acid gas. Supposing tho room to be only 12 feet square and 10 feet in height, its.contents would be 1,440 cubic feet of air. The 28 cubic inches of sulphurous acid gas arc less than 1-60th of a cubic foot, or 1-86,000th part of the cubical contents of the room. Moreover, it must be remembered that this quantity is only thrown into the atmosphere gradually during six hours, and that during that time some change in the air of the room must be taking place. It will then be seen that the talk which is made about the 'Sulphur in Gas' is after all raised upon what is practically a thing of very little, if any, importance from a sanitary or economical point of view. It will be further seen how utterly trifling this is when it is considered that common house coal contains from 2 to 3 per cent. of sulphur, which is converted into sulphurous acid during its combustion. Every 100 lbs. of such coal yields, consequently, say 25 lbs. of sulphur, which produces in burning 0 lbs. of sulphurous acid, which is equal to no less than 50.940 cubic inches of this gas. It is a moot question whether small quantities of sulphurous acid may not be wholesome rather than the reverse in an atmosphere charged, as that of the Metropolis must always be, with organic exhalation; but however that may be, the quantity produced in the combustion of common gas is far too small to permit of its producing any sanitary effect, noxious or otherwise. Mr. Thomas Wills, Lecturer upon Chemistry, at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, says : — There are three special points to be insisted on :— 14 1st.—The character of the Sulphur Impurity in Coal Gas. 2nd. The insignificance of its amount even when abnormally high. 3rd The undue importance, and the mistaken idea in the public mind respecting the amount of the evil done by its means 1st. The Sulphur impurity in Coal Gas is of a two-fold nature, each kind having fundamental and characteristic differences. Sulphuretted Hydrogen, Bisulphide of Carbon. Sulphuretted Hydrogen, an exceedingly poisonous and offensive gas. Bisulphide of Carbon (forming the residual sulphur), the vapour of a highly volatile liquid, neither so injurious or offensive as sulphuretted hydrogen. The removal from the coal gas of the more noxious sulphuretted hydrogen, is comparatively easy, and invariably accomplished, by the Companies before its supply to the public. Much greater difficulty in removing the bisulphide of carbon {i.e. the matter now under discussion) ; it is in some cases, at present impossible, without considerable expense and space, and also at the risk of creating a nuisance. The subject of the purification of gas from bisulphide of carbon, one that is being at the present time investigated, and upon which many experiments are being made, hence, until something satisfactory has been arrived at, it would be manifestly injudicious and unwise for any Company to incur any considerable expense, in the matter of plant or space, in the present uncertainty and without some addition to their present knowledge. The bisulphide of carbon present in the gas is inflammable, and is burnt with the gas, the products of its combustion being carbonic acid gas and sulphurous acid gas; this latter substance contains the whole of the present in the bisulphide. Under no circumstances whatever can the bisulphide of carbon, cither 15 during its passage from the works or during its combustion be converted into the more objectionable sulphuretted hydrogen. No sample of coal gas is absolutely free from the presence of sulphur, in the form of bisulphide of carbon, the quantity usually varying from about 10 to 30 or 40 grains per 100 cubic feet of gas. 2nd.—The great insignificance of the presence of even the higher amount when reasonably considered. It is evident that the correct way of speaking of this impurity, when the effects it produces are being considered, is as of sulphurous acid gas—this product being the one into which the whole of the sulphur present in the gas at once goes on combustion, and the form in which the supposed evil is done. It appears likely to mislead to speak of an impurity as so many grains per cubic feet. It should rather be grains in grains or cubic inches in cubic feet, and as it is with volume and not weight we have most to do, the latter is preferable. One grain of sulphur contained in the coal gas as bisulphide of carbou, when burnt, produces 2.8 cubic inches of sulphurous acid gas; so that 3.3 cubic feet of coal gas containing 30 grains of sulphur per 100 cubic feet would have to be burnt in order to produce this amount, or an ordinary fish-tail burner for the space of nearly an hour. Further, the quantity of sulphurous acid gas produced is related, not so much to the quantity of gas in which it occurs, but to the capacity of the apartment in which the gas is burnt. Taking about the smallest habitable room in which a gas jet would be burned, one say, 6ft. by Oft. by 8ft.; this would give the infinitesimal amount of .00056 per cent. in volumes of sulphurous acid gas spread over the space of one hour, a quantity that need not be considered. Again. Two fish-tail burners, burning gas for six hours continuously, at the rate of 4 cubic feet each per hour, will give off during that time 43'6 cubic inches of sulphurous acid gas, a quantity equal to .0009 per cent. of the volume 16 in a room 15ft. by 15ft. by 12ft., or 9 parts per 1,000,000. A room of this size will contain 13/4 cwt. of air, and in this weight of air 15 grains of sulphur will be diffused. In both these cases it is presumed that the whole of the sulphurous acid gas remains as such, and also the whole of it in the room, two things which it is known do not take place. Carbonic acid gas is a gas of a noxious character and also deleterious to health, yet there is present in the atmosphere, under normal circumstances and in the most open situations, a quantity equal to more than 40 times the amount of sulphurous acid gas mentioned above, and it is yet imperceptible to our senses. Also it should be remembered, that ventilation is constantly taking place and reducing the amount even in the closest rooms. The ill effects upon the system generally complained of, as the result of remaining in close and badly ventilated rooms where fires or gas-lights are burning, arc headache, languor, and nausea. These all arise from the presence of carbonic acid gas, and not from sulphurous acid gas, the effect of which, if inhaled, is felt in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and produces the signs of catarrh. 3rd. The extent of the evil produced by the presence of bisulphide of carbon in the gas has been much exaggerated and has given to it undue prominence, partly from a misconception on the part of the public that all sulphur compounds are alike in character, and that therefore bisulphide of carbon is as bad as sulphuretted hydrogen, and partly by placing to the account of sulphurous acid effects which in reality are not due to it. Rooms lighted by any artificial means should be well ventilated, more for the sake of getting rid of the carbonic acid gas and the moisture produced than of the sulphurous acid. Doubtless, if the sulphur could be all removed it would be a good thing, but the presence of a few grains more or less of sulphur, as bisulphide of carbon, in a hundred cubic feet of gas is of very small consequence. 17 REPORT OF MR. HEISCH. Cm* Gas Examiner's Office, 8, Savage Gardens, E.C., November 4th, 1874. To the Lewisham District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have carefully considered the various documents transmitted to me by your orders concerning the Sulphur in the Phoenix Gas, and beg to report thereon as follows:— I would first remark that the lecture of Dr. Odling is of somewhat old date; and that in a lecture delivered before the Association of Gas Managers some years later on a kindred subject as the one sent you, none of the statements therein contained are re-produced. The outline of Mr. Keates' evidence is mainly taken from a paper written by him many years ago, when he was Consulting Chemist to the City of London Gas Works. Mr. "Wills was for some time Dr. Odling's Assistant, and what he says is mostly a copy of Dr. Odling's statements. The subject may be considered under three heads:— 1st—Is an excess of sulphur injurious? 2nd—Can the sulphur be removed ? 3rd—Will its removal create a nuisance? 1st.—The evidence of Dr. Odling, Mr. Keates, and Mr. Wills, is, for all practical purposes, the same, and is founded on an error which would have been exposed by a few minutes' cross-examination bv a well-instructed counsel. All three gentlemen speak of the result of the combustion of the sulphur in gas as sulphurous acid gas. When sulphur is burnt in dry air, or dry oxygen, this gas is produced, but when burnt even in a slightly moist atmosphere, part is converted into sulphuric acid, and when burnt with a large 18 quantity of hydrogen (as in coal gas), the oxidation of which produces water in large quantities, the amount of sulphurous acid formed is quite insignificant, nearly all the sulphur being converted into sulphuric acid, not a gas but a vapour, readily condensed on all the walls of, and articles contained in, a room, and most difficult to remove, even by a strong draught through the room, much less by the ordinary means of ventilation. Even if the sulphur, as it issues from the burner, were in the state of sulphurous acid, in the presence of the quantity of water simultaneously formed, it would be oxidized into sulphuric acid long before it could be removed from the room, and the corrosive and destructive effects thus go on accumulating. That such is the fact the experience of everyone who notices the effect of burning gas on metal articles, plants, &c., abundantly proves. Let me now set against the statements of Messrs. Odling, Keates, and Wills, the following statement of what experience proves to be the fact. Each grain of sulphur in burning, as it does in gas, gives rise to the production of just over three grains of sulphuric acid. 100 cubic feet of gas, if it contain 30 grains of sulphur(a very common amount), would in burning produce 90 grains of sulphuric acid, and three burners each burning 4 cubic feet per hour, would produce between 3 and 4 grains of sulphuric acid per hour, or about 20 grains in 6 hours, which would in great part be condensed oil the contents of the room in which the gas is burned. Such a process repeated every day fully accounts for the destruction which occurs when gas is burned. I may remark, in passing, that carbonic acid and water are both as much produced by any other light (oil lamps for instance) as by gas light, yet the same destructive effects are not produced. Anyone who will take the trouble to examine the corrosion occurring on metal-work where gas is burnt will find it to consist of sulphate of the metal. All tradesmen are only too well acquainted with the rotting effects produced by gas on their goods. One most instructive instance in proof of the above assertion I may mention. Some years since gas was introduced at the Royal 19 Observatory in place of camphine lamps for the photographic registration of magnetic variations, &c. In a very short time the surface of every reflector was destroyed, and the drawtubes of the telescopes quite corroded. It was found necessary to place a tube over each burner, and to connect all these with a central chimney in which a strong draught was maintained to carry off the products of combustion. These tubes were, for cheapness, made of zinc. In a few days all the lamps were found extinguished by a crystaline substance which dropped on the burners from the tubes. This proved to be sulphate of zinc. I recommended the substitution of tinned copper tubes, but the price was objected to, and a contrivance was resorted to by which the condensed matter was run into a vessel at the side of tho chimney. In one of these vessels I collected, in six woeks, from a burner consuming about halfa-foot per hour, 3/4-11). sulphate of zinc. In this case unusual means were used to carry off the acid in the state of vapour, but with what effect the result showed. This result fully confirms all the statements made by boot-makers and others of the rotting effects of the products of gas combustion. It will be observed that at the Observatory there was simply the substitution of one combustible for another (gas for camphine), no greater number of burners being employed after gas was introduced, and the flames of both the gas and the camphine being of the same size. Carbonic acid and water must have been as abundantly produced by the camphine as by the gas, yet no ill effects were produced, though it was burnt for at least a year, while a week sufficed to show the destructive effects of the gas. Dr. Odling makes much of the difference between gas burned slowlv and at the ordinary rate, and might, perhaps, attribute some of the above results to the smallness of the flames employed. If so, I would reply, that as these flames were required to give as much light as possible, the supply of air was certainly not more abundant than in an ordinary gas flame; so that no greater amount of oxidation was likely to take place. I will further state, that I examined the liquid which condensed in 20 the pipe of a gas stove burning 7 or 8 feet per hour, and found that it contained large quantities of sulphuric acid, and was very corrosive, at least as much so as that produced by the small flame. It will be observed that neither of the three gentlemen quoted by the Gas Company produce any practical proof of their assertion that sulphurous acid gas is the product of the combustion of the sulphur in coal gas. I have searched for it in vain, while the sulphuric acid is always abundant. Dr. Odling's theory that the air contains ammonia enough to neutralize all sulphuric acid formed, even it' true, of very crowded rooms, is certainly not so of ordinary sitting rooms. I would call especial attention to Dr. Letheby's reply to Dr. Odling, reported in the same journal as the lecture, showing that even at that time, practical men did not agree with his theories.* 2nd.—Can the sulphur be removed ? The best answer to this is, that at the present time the gas with which the City of London is supplied contains on an average only 12 grains of sulphur per 100 cubic feet. That which for many years was supplied by the Great Central Company contained even less. The question of what can be done with the present plant of the Company, is not one on which I think we are bound to enter. In 1860 the Company entered into an agreement to supply gas containing only 20 grains of sulphur to 100 cubic feet, and during all the succeeding years they might have quietly made the necessary alterations in their plant without any undue pressure ; that they have not made the attempt to carry out their agreement is no reason for now sparing them. The assertion that the Act of 1860 has never been acted upon is only partly true. The City took action against one of the Companies supplying it, shortly after the Act came into full operation, and Dr. Letheby (the Gas Examinier to the City at that time) was prepared with abundant proof of the corrosive effects of the sulphuric acid generated. * Nore.- They reply given in Appendix, p. 25. 21 The case, however, fell through, owing to its being ruled that the Aldermen were the only magistrates in the City, and thus prosecutor and judge were virtually the same person, which could not be permitted. This defect of jurisdiction alone prevented the Act of 1860 being enforced. Before concluding this part of the subject, I would add that the Metropolitan Gas Referees in their Sulphur Report, 1872, state that they are now sure that lime, properly used, is a perfect means of taking out the sulphur from gas, and that its removal can be effected with as great certainty as that of ammonia or sulphuretted hydrogen. 3rd.—Does the removal of the sulphur necessarily produce a nuisance? That if the purifiers be simply opened and emptied, a nuisance is produced, no one can doubt, but that it is impossible to prevent it is not by any means proved. Dr. Letheby (the Consulting Chemist of the Phoenix Company) has repeatedly said that it is not, and most chemists will agree with him; trouble and expense it may cause, but the result is worth the cost. Any one observing the difference in the destructive effects of the gas now supplied to the City and that which was supplied three years ago, or is still supplied to many places outside the City, will have no doubt on this point. The present Metropolitan Gas Referees, though more lenient to the Gas Companies than their predecessors, permit 25 grains of sulphur in gas made at Urban works, only for a time, till the requisite alterations are made, so that they, even, manifestly do not admit the impossibility of the removal of the sulphur without producing a nuisance if proper means are taken to prevent it. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHAS. HEISCH, F.C.S., Superintending Gas Examiner to the Corporation of the City of London. 22 appendix. Further extracts from Dr. Odling's Lecture. * "So much, then, with regard to the ammonia as existing in coal gas; and now to consider the sulphur. As all gas contains ammonia, so all gas contains sulphur in greater or less proportion. When this sulphur burns it gets converted into what is termed sulphurous acid, and when this sulphurous acid is exposed for a sufficient length of time to the air it takes up more oxygen, and gets converted into sulphuric acid, which, in a concentrated form, is known as oil of vitriol. But no matter under what circumstances you burn sulphur, it does not burn directly into sulphuric acid—it only burns into sulphurous acid. No matter at what temperature you burn the gas, you get sulphurous acid produced, and not sulphuric; but when this sulphurous acid is exposed to the air and to moisture, under these circumstances it absorbs oxygen, and gets converted into sulphuric acid, and it is possible that, under certain circumstances, supposing the sulphuric acid to be so formed, it might get to a reasonable degree of concentration. " One word as to the character of this sulphurous acid. It is a substance which, in a concentrated state, is very irritating. Now-a-days we do not meet with sulphur matches, they are generally tipped with paraffin, though most of us know the irritating effect upon the nose of sulphurous acid; but, though very irritating, it is not at all corrosive. As medical men, we all understand the difference, that such a thing as cantharides or snuff, for instance, is extremely irritating, but yet not corrosive. Just so with sulphurous acid. chemically speaking, it is one of the weakest acids with which we are acquainted, and corresponds, in respect to acidity, most nearly with that very feeble acid, carbonic acid. * Note.- The following part of Dr. Odling's Lecture immediately precede the part extracted by the company, and given at p. 10. 23 You know that sulphurous acid is used for the bleaching of silk, straw, &c., and for the preservation of catgut and things of that kind, which, if corrosive, it would be quite unfit for. Therefore, per it is not a corrosive substance, except in a concentrated form, and then but very feebly. "With regard to the amount of sulphur produced in the combustion of gas, the Act of Parliament says that 100 cubic feet of gas shall not contain of sulphur, in any form, more than 20 grains. Now, the ordinary mode of estimating the amount of sulphur in gas, consists in burning the gas somewhat in this form f illustrating , and then collecting the products of combustion, and estimating the sulphate of baryta obtainable therefrom. The process is based upon the assumption that the whole of the sulphur in the gas gets burnt. But we know that the whole of the carbon does not, and neither does the whole of the sulphur; so that in a process of this kind we only estimate, so to speak, so much of the sulphur in the gas as in the burning of the gas gets converted into sulphurous acid. But in an experiment of this kind the gas is burnt under very different conditions to those under which it is burnt when we use it as an illuminating agent, and, so far as I know, no experiments have been made to show the amount of sulphurous acid produced by a certaiu number of cubic feet of gas when burnt in the ordinary way. A great many experiments have been made with the gas burnt in one small jet, or from a Leslie's burner burning at a very slow rate; but, so far as I know, there have been no experiments, at any rate not satisfactory experiments, where gas has been burnt at the rate of 5 cubic feet an hour, under the ordinary conditions ; and it must not be assumed that the amount of sulphurous acid produced per cubic foot of gas is the same when the gas is burnt in two such different manners. It may be very different. So far, then, as regards the amount of sulphurous acid produced, all I can tell you is, that when gas is burnt somewhat in this way it gives rise to an amount of sulphurous acid which corresponds to about the 20 grains of sulphur allowed by the Act of Parliament. Very frequently 24 it is two or three grains over; very frequently a few grains under. At the same time, when we perform the experiment, not in this way, but in a strictly chemical way, in a way in which it would be performed in a laboratory, under these circumstances we find the sulphur habitually to exceed the 20 grains allowed by the Act of Parliament; although, as I have said, when we have regard to the products of combustion yielded when the gas is burnt in an apparatus of this kind, we find it affords an amount of sulphurous acid or sulphate of ammonia corresponding with the average amount of 20 grains allowed by the Act of Parliament, and sometimes less.* * * * * | " But now comes the question of the conversion of the sulphurous into sulphuric acid. That, first of all, is not a rapid process. It is very rapid indeed so far as regards a partial conversion, for it is very difficult to have sulphurous acid in the air without a proportion of it being converted into sulphuric acid; but you must remember, when dealing with these minute proportions, that the minute proportions of other substances existing in the atmosphere become similarly important, and particularly the proportion of ammonia. It would appear that the amount of ammonia existing even in the open atmosphere is sufficient to neutralize the amount of sulphuric acid formed under the circumstances of gas combustion; but in a room where a large amount of gas is burning a room crowded with human beings—the exhalations give out an excess of ammonia, which would be sufficient to 1 iii more than neutralize any amount of sulphurous acid that might chance to get converted into sulphuric acid. Of course, if you set to work with a view to convert the sulphurous acid gas into sulphuric acid, you can readily do it. If you cause such a burner as this to burn under a vessel which is Kept cold by having a free current of water passing through * Note.- Here follws the part of Dr. Odling's Lecture extracted by the Company. See p. 10. †This part of Dr. Olding's Lecture immediately followed the part extracted by the company. See p. 13. 25 it, the bottom of the vessel is constantly covered with a layer of moisture; the sulphurous acid gets condensed in this moisture, and a portion of it converted into dilute sulphuric acid, which gradually becomes concentrated acid. In this way you may produce a certain quantity of sulphuric acid by the combustion of gas; but, when gas is burnt under ordinary conditions, so as to diffuse its products into the atmosphere, the produced sulphurous acid can only form about a thousandth part of the carbonic acid gas existing in the room as a product of gas combustion, even upon the excessive assumption that the gas contains double the amount of sulphur allowed by the standard of the Act of Parliament." In the discussion which followed Dr. Odling's Lecture, Dr. Letheby is reported in the same Gas Journal to have said on the subject of sulphur, as follows :— "And now I am desirous of making a few remarks on the effects of the sulphur in coal gas. Dr. Odling has directed your attention to this matter from a statistical point of view, and has shown you how, by a mathematical process, the amount of sulphur acids in the products of burning gas may be reduced to a vanishing point, and that, therefore, they must be insignificant and wholly harmless; but I will ask you to look at the subject from another point of view, and to examine it by the light of facts as well as of figures. About 15 or 20 years ago, when I began to enquire into this matter, I was struck with a circumstance which is now, as it was then, very remarkable—namely, that wherever gas is burnt continuously, and in large quantity, it causes a rapid destruction of textile fabrics, with a verv acid condition of them. This is notably so in our public libraries, and in warehouses and shops. I obtained so many striking proofs of this, especially from the libraries of the Athenaeum Club-House, the London Institution, the College of Surgeons, and elsewhere, that I made them the subject of a special report to the City authorities in 1854 ; and here you will see the specimens of 26 covers of books which were furnished to me at that time. If you apply a little piece of the leather to your tongue, you will taste its acidity ; and if it be treated with water or spirit of wine and tested with a solution of baryta, it will be found that the acid is sulphuric acid. These effects were observed many years ago in the library of the Athenaeum Olub-House, and they were growing to be so serious that the managers requested a commision of chemists—including Mr. Faraday, Mr. Brande, Dr. Prout, Mr. Aiken, and others—to inquire into it, and I have before me a copy of their report on the subject. It is to the effect that the mischief is clearly due to the presence of sulphuric acid which had come from the burning gas; and they state that the mischief will continue so long as gas is used in the library without proper ventilation. Mr. Faraday thereupon designed the system of ventilation which is still used in the library. As to the effects of the products of burning gas on shop goods, they are notorious, for such goods are regularly disposed of as damaged or gassy things. It has been remarked, too, that plants are quickly killed by the products of burning gas, for thev are peculiarly susceptible of injury from the presence of sulphurous acid in the air. According to Drs. Christison and Turner, as little as one part in 10,000 of air will kill plants in less than 24 hours. And you cannot use gas in a conservatory, either for heating or for illuminating purposes, unless the products of combustion are entirely removed. Dr. Christison has written to me very strongly on this subject, and he attributes the absence of flowers and plants from the rooms of Edinburgh to the circumstance that gas is universally used in them, Advancmg a step further in my inquiries, I ascertained that the water produced by burning gas, collect it how you will, is always acid, and will rot leather, paper, cotton/and linen, Here are specimens of such tissues, which have been dipped in the condensed liquid products of gas combustion, and you Will observe that they are as rotten as tinder Lastly, I trived a plan wherby the amount of sulphur in coal gas could be estimated. I had thought that the instrument was 27 ciently well known, and the rationale of its action thoroughly understood; but the instrument which Dr. Odling has placed upon the table, and has described to you as my ingenious contrivance, is so different in all its essential particulars from my instrument, that I disown it, and call it an ingenious perversion of the apparatus which bears my name. I know from experience that such an instrument will not discover half the amount of sulphur that is really present in coal gas; and I have no doubt that the discrepancies which have lately been referred to by writers on this subject have been occasioned by the use of such an instrument as is now upon the table. The particulars of my instrument, the measurements of the several parts of it, and the mode of using it, are fullv described in Mr. Sugg's book on gas manipulation, and if it be used in a proper manner it will discover ail the sulphur of the gas; and thus it will be found that the amount of sulphur may reach to from 30 to 40 grains per 100 cubic feet of gas. If the presence of sulphur in such quantity in coal gas was an unavoidable necessity, and could not be reduced by anv reasonable process of manufacture or purification, it would be folly to complain of it, other than to show the necessity for good ventilation where gas is burnt; but this is not the case, for there are processes of purification which will easily diminish the amount of sulphur to less than half the usual quantity. Mr. Ilawksley—whose presence this evening will, I hope, be useful to us, by his giving us the results of his large experience in this matter—has shown that, by copiously washing raw gas with ammoniacal liquor, it is possible to remove a large proportion of the sulphur compounds of gas without injuring in the slightest degree its illuminating power. After this treatment the gas should be deprived of its sulphuretted hydrogen by means of hydrated oxide of iron ; and then, while a little ammonia is still remaining in it, it should be further purified by passing it through dry lime, which is the slightly moistened hydrate of lime. In this way the ammoniacal liquor is strengthened to a high degree— it being rarely less than of 10-oz. strength—by the absorp- 28 tion of ammonia compounds, and by the removal of sulphur in other forms than that of sulphuretted hydrogen. The hydrated oxide of iron is also less foul than it usually is, and is capable of revivification without causing annoyance; while the hydrate of lime is actually inoffensive, for it contains nothing but carbonic acid and sulphocyanogen, with; a little sulphide—the carbonic acid being absorbed from the gas, and the sulphocyanogen and sulphide produced by the reaction of ammonia on bisulphide of carbon in the presence of caustic lime. Mr. Hawksley will tell you, what I also know from experience, that by these means the amount of sulphur in coal gas is easily and certainly feduced to about 10 or 12 grains per 100 cubic feet of gas. It is easy, as I have said, to meet this question by a numerical argument, and to show, by a mathematical process of reasoning, that the amount of sulphur in gas may be made to vanish to almost nothing; but T would rather examine the practical or experimental facts, and endeavour to remedy what is, among practical men, an acknowledged evil, by applying those remedies which are clearly within our reach." Extract from the Report of Mr. A. J. Bay lis to the Commissioners of Sewers, dated 25th February, I860. To the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, Great Central Gas Company. have the honour to report that, having in pursuance of your instructions, taken proceedings against the above Com- pany for supplying gas of a quality inferior to that prescribed by the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, the case came on for hearingbefore Mr. Alderman Stone, at the Guildhall Justice oom, on the 23rd instant. The proceedings were taken according to the invariable practice, in the name of 29 your Clerk; and two technical objections were raised at the hearing by Mr. Coleridge (who appeared for the Gas Company); 1st—That your Honourable Court had no power to institute these proceedings in the name of their Clerk; 2nd —That the Commissioners of Sewers were not the "Local Authority" under the Metropolis Gas Act, and had not, therefore, the power to take any proceedings against the Gas Companies, I need hardly say that both these points were rather technical, and altogether evaded the real merits of the case, which I had been lead to believe the Companv were anxious to meet, as they had previously alleged that thev had a triumphant answer to the charge of supplying impure gas to the citizens. The Alderman rided that the 1st objection raised by the Company was fatal, a decision to which, however erroneous it may be, there was no alternative but to submit; and no decision was given to the second point. Thus the Company have for the moment, on a mere question of form, stifled what was in effect a public inquiry into the quality of their gas, and they leave the charge of your Honourable Court still hanging, without even attempting an answer. The Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, Section 25. The quality of the common gas supplied by any Gas Company shall be, with respect to its illuminating power, at a distance as near as may be of one thousand yards from the Works, such as to produce from an Argand burner having fifteen holes and a seven-inch chimney, consuming live cubic feet of gas an hour, a light equal in intensity to the light produced by not less than twelve sperm candles of six to the pound, each burning one hundred and twenty grains an hour; and the quality of cannel gas supplied by any Gas Company shall, with respect to its illuminating power at the distance aforesaid, be such as to produce from a batswing or fishtail burner, consuming five feet of gas per hour, a light equal in 30 intensity to twenty such sperm candles, and each such gas shall, with respect to its purity, be so far free from ammonia and sulphurretted hydrogen that it shall not discolour either turmeric paper or paper imbued with acetate or carbonate of lead when these tests are exposed to a current of gas issuing for one minute under a pressure of five-tenths of an inch of water, and shall not contain more than twenty grains of sulphur in any form, in one hundred cubic feet of gas; provided that any Gas Company and the Local Authorities of the district supplied by such Company shall be at liberty to agree upon any other different test by which to ascertain the purity of the gas, or to vary the amounts of ammonia or sulphur in any form hereinbefore allowed, and thereupon the Company shall be thenceforth liable to have the purity of their gas tested in the manner so prescribed. THE BOARD OF WORKS for The Lewisham District.

INST. C.E., E.G.S., &c. printed by order of the board. printed by w. ii. crockford, jun., lewisham, and blackiieath road. 1875. REPORT to The Board of Works for the Lewisham District, and the Board of Guardians of the Bromley Union, on Tub Sewerage and Surface Drainage of the District adjacent to the boundary between Penge and Beckenham. 18, Great George Street, Westminster, 31st December, 1874. Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions, I beg to submit for your consideration the following Report on the above matters, together with a large scale Plan, and levels of the principal Sewers and Waterways of the northern part of the Hamlet of Penge, in the County of Surrey, and the greater portion of the "Tongue of Land" in the Beckenham Sewerage Area, in the County of Kent, showing also works which I advise the two Sanitary Authorities, jointly or separately, to carry out, for the purpose of more effectually draining the neighbourhood. Some delay having occurred in the completion of this Plan and Report, I may explain that the surveys, levels, and investigations occupied a long time, and that, although early in this year it was arranged that I should act for both Boards in the business now under consideration, and I then commenced my surveys, yet, in consequence of a protracted correspondence between the Boards, relating to the principles upon which the cost of works might be apportioned, it was not until the 28th of July that I received full instructions and extracts from the correspondence and minutes. 4 Preparation of general plan. In order to deal economically with the matters submitted to me, it was necessary to have a general plan of the existing Sewers and Waterways, with levels, but no such plan existed ; and with the concurrence of the two Boards, I proceeded, as under, to provide one. The Beckenham Sewerage Act, 1873, requires that before the construction within the Sewerage Area, of any sewer which is to be connected with the Penge and Bell Green Sewer, Plans and Sections shall be submitted for the approval of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Lewisham Board: and that the plans shall be on "such convenient scale as the said respective Boards from time to time require." Having ascertained that the Boards required these plans to be on a scale of 5 feet to a mile, the scale generally adopted by the Metropolitan Board, I determined to prepare the General Plan on that scale; and proceeded by enlarging the 251 inch Ordnance Map, which is old and imperfect, by making surveys, and taking levels of Roads, Streets, and Buildings, as well as of existing Sewers, Drains, and Waterways, requiring numerous openings of the ground, to prepare the plan now presented; which, although imperfect, and not minutely accurate (being based on an enlargement), is sufficient for the present purpose, and can be added to from time to time, as further information is obtained, by any one using it. In the course of my investigations I had numerous communications with parties connected with the various properties, Engineers, Architects, Agents, &c. I paid visits from time to time to the Crystal Palace, and, with the kind help of the Company's Engineer and his assistants, ascertained the course, &c., of some of the sewers and waterways in the Palace grounds, not shown on any plan which could be found. In some cases, at the Crystal Palace and elsewhere, the Probable cost of opening the ground, and the annoyances inseparable from it, appeared to outweigh the advantages of an accurate survey of the conduits, and they are put on the 5 plan from the best information otherwise obtainable, some of them no doubt being omitted. On account of the difficulty of getting accurate information about underground conduits of various sizes, constructed at different times; the necessity for examining and filling up without delay any openings made; and in consequence of the extent to which building operations have been carried on since the Ordnance Map was corrected; the surveys, investigations, and levels occupied an amount of time which may appear large, when compared with the works now proposed; but I may mention that it was the information thus obtained that enabled me, by utilising existing conduits, to reduce to such small proportions the works now recommended for construction. The Plan which has occasionally, while in progress, been submitted to Committees of both the Bromley and Lewisham Hoards, will form a useful basis for economy in future works, not only near the boundary, but in any part of either District which it comprises. I have other levels and particulars of Sewers and Waterways in parts of Penge, and the Beckenham Sewerage Area, not shown on this plan. The nuisance caused by the drainage of houses (chiefly on Kent House the Birkbeck Estate) into the Boundary Ditch near BeckenLane sewer. ham Road, appeared to require the earliest attention, and, with the sanction of the Local Committees, I prepared a separate Report dealing with it, and recommending the construction of a Sewer along Kent House Lane, to take the sewage of the Birkbeck Estate, Beckenham, and of a portion of Penge. This Sewer, which is 2,300 feet in length, is now approaching completion. With reference to the question of disposing of the storm- Storm water. waters, I stated in the Report referred to, that it would be for the Sanitary Authority "to consider how far they have power, and think it right, to compel owners of property to make separate provision for disposing of the rainfall on the roads, houses, and gardens respectively." 6 Rainfall conducted to Sewers not intended for Storm waters As regards the Birkbeck instate, tne outlet into the Country Ditch near the Beckenham Road, at present used for sewage may be retained for the overflow of storm-waters, until some better provision is made; but still the chief difficulty in making arrangements for the complete drainage of these districts is in dealing with the rainfall during heavy storms. By the existing sewers and drains, which have in some cases been constructed along the natural water-courses, the rainfall of a large portion of the land occupied by houses and gardens in the extensive suburbs of Anerley, Penge, and Sydenham (including a portion of Beckenham Sewerage Area), is conducted, with the sewage, to the Penge and Bell Green, and the Sydenham Sewers. This arrangement produces no inconvenience during a moderate rainfall; but neither the Penge and Bell Green Sewer, nor the Sewer of the Metropolitan Board, which it joins [the Ravensbourne and Sydenham Main Sewer], was intended, or is of sufficient size for carrying storm rainfall. That the Metropolitan system of sewers generally was intended to carry only a small portion of a heavy rainfall, is clearly stated in Sir J. W. Bazalgette's paper on the Main Drainage of London, read at the Institution of Civil Engineers, in 1865. The Penge and Bell Green Sewer, 3 feet 9 inches high, and 2 feet 6 inches wide, and the Sydenham Sewer, 3 feet high and 2 feet wide, join the Metropolitan system at Bell Green, whence, for a distance of about three-quarters of a mile towards the outlet, the Metropolitan Main Sewer is only the same size as the Penge and Bell Green Sewer, and both the last-mentioned sewers, together about two miles in length, are occasionally filled to overflowing. flooding at Peng. These floodings during storms caused, until recently, serious damage in the cellars and lowest floors of some of the houses at Penge, and having been instructed by the Lewisham Board to deal with the matter, so far as it affected the Hamlet, after carrying out some improvements in the Penge and Bell Green Sewer, I made surveys and constructed 7 numerous small and inexpensive works at Penge, which, by diverting a considerable portion of the storm-waters from the sewers, re-opening the natural channels, and by other means, materially reduced the evil. Other works arc postponed, while observations are made, during storms, as to the effect of those already constructed. I devoted (as before alluded to) a considerable amount of attention to the Crystal Palace and Grounds, where there is a large area—the greater part in Penge, and the remainder in Beckenham—from which, on account of its steepness, the rainfall runs off very rapidly, the water which is not absorbed by the land, or caught in the reservoirs, being at present mixed with the sewage where it leaves the Palace Grounds. The Crystal Palace Company's Engineer had, previously to my first visit, made some drains and connections, for the purpose of conducting to the Company's basins and reservoirs a portion of this rainfall. Since our joint investigations, he has been able, by the construction of other small works, to divert to the reservoirs additional surface water, which, while valuable to the Company, it is important to keep out of the sewers. Rainfall Crystal Palace. Further works with the same object may yet be carried out. The Beckenham Sewerage Act, 1873, section 7, requires that the Guardians of the Bromley Union "shall, so far as is practicable, prevent" the storm-waters of the Beckenham Sewerage Area from flowing into the sewers, and thereby into the Penge and Bell Green Sewer; and the Lewisham Board of Works, on the l6th July, 1874. passed a resolution recommended by their Penge Local Committee, " that the Bromley Guardians be informed generally of the proceedings of this Board, with a view of separating the surface water from the sewerage drainage of the Hamlet, and be urged to adopt a similar course with reference to the Beckenham Sewerage Area, as a compliance with the 7th section of the Beckenham Sewerage Act, 1873." I have kept this in view, while considering the works now required; and, with reference to the future, I think it would Storm waters Beckenham sewerage area. 8 Separate system for surfacc water. be desirable that an arrangement should be made, between the two Boards, to adopt similar regulations, as to the drainage of roads and gardens, as well as of houses. This raises again the important question of how far a double system—a sewer or drain lor the sewage, and a separate conduit for clean water is to be carried, as regards both existing and future roads, houses, and gardens. To separate entirely the storm-water from the sewage, the double system must be carried to each street and house, as a large portion of the rainfall descends on the houses and gardens. This system if applied to a district already drained, and especially where water-courses have been converted into sewers, would cause a very large outlay, and a great amount of interference with private property; but its application to future roads and buildings would not involve such serious consequences, and deserves consideration. Unless some arrangements be made to separate the surface water from the sewage, the portion of rainfall seeking an outlet through the main sewer, will be augmented by the construction of sewers and drains from new roads and houses, as the process of converting agricultural land into building land goes on. The Alexandra Cottages, about 160 houses in the ham Sewerage Area, have a double system of drains ; but I know of no other instance in the Sewerage Area, or Penge, where the system is applied to any considerable number of houses. I am of opinion that, apart from the question of cost, the separation of the rainfall and land water from the sewage and house drainage, may, under some circumstances, be crriedd too far; as the want of sufficient water to cleanse sewers and drains where the gradients are flat, would cause evils, which, although difficult to measure, may be far more serious than occasional floodings, the effects of which are apparent. Values to house drains Among the works carried out at Penge for the Lewisham Board, I have fixed self-acting valves or flaps in the sewers, 9 at the junctions of the several drains from houses which have been flooded; these, if kept in order, prevent the sewage from flowing back from the sewers into the cellars, or lowest floors of the houses ; but in the case of very heavy storms, the rain falling on the roofs and gardens, if not diverted from the cellars, may cause inconvenience, the outlet through the house drains being necessarily closed for a short time, if the water in the sewer rise above that in the cellar. In the present state of things it would be well to put in these valves wherever required in Beckenham or Penge, and to caution parties who have cellars liable to be flooded, to restrict their use so as to reduce to a minimum the damage which may be caused by sudden storms. Before arranging the works for dealing with the sewage and surface water, near the boundary between Penge and Beckenham, it was necessary to determine whether the line of culvert and pipes running along the County boundary, in the Crystal Palace Grounds, and thence in a south-easterly direction across Penge Park Estate, under houses, gardens, and other properties, to the Parish Lane, should be used for sewage and surface water as heretofore, or only for surface water; and I spent some considerable time in getting information and balancing the somewhat complicated advantages and disadvantages of each course, and in consulting with the Local Committees thereon. After well considering all the circumstances, and the strong desire of the Lewisham Board that the culvert should be kept for clean water, I determined to recommend the adoption of that course, although it may be difficult to prevent houses, over and near the culvert, from draining into it. Boundary culvert. This boundary conduit, which runs along a natural watercourse, is irregularly laid, and varies in size and construction; the greater part is barrel culvert, about two feet in diameter; the portions under the railway are culverts of a larger size, and other portions are pipes 18 inches in diameter; therefore a man could not go through to examine it, and as it passes near or under about a dozen houses or gardens, we have not 10 yet accurately ascertained what drains are connected with it. Although the Lewisham Hoard of Works, at consideral, cost and inconvenience, had arranged some of their sewers e as to prevent the sewage of Penge from getting into thi culvert, and (as I was informed) a former Sanitary Committe of Beckenham had intimated that they did not intend allow it to be used as a sewer, I found that a considerable number of houses, in both Parishes, drained into it. I informed both Boards of this some months ago, in order that the evil might not be augmented, as new houses were being built near the boundary. Proposed works. Having determined to use the boundary culvert tor clea water only, I carefully considered the works that would be required, keeping steadily in view the desirability, for obvious reasons, of limiting the expenditure to works which are neccessary at present, and leaving the cost of doubtful works to be weighed against the inconveniences which may remain. Some of the works and arrangements which I have allowed to stand are not such as I should originate, but they may answer for the present at all events, and, possibly, for a considerable time. The questions, large and small, which have arisen in the course of the surveys and investigations, have been very numerous and complicated, and seemed to be almost interminable ; and although I have spared no pains in attempting to do the best I could under the circumstances, further information may throw a new light on some of the matters. Underneath is a Schedule of the Works which I recommend for construction; most of them have been discussed, and in general terms approved, by Committees of both Boards. 11 SCHEDULE OF PROPOSED WORKS.

That, if required, the house lately occupied by Mr. Covell, in Kent House Lane, near the boundary between Beckenham and Lewisham, be drained into the Lewisham Sewer. 14 And that the Alexandra Tavern, with the house adjoining??? in Penge, be drained into the Beckenham Sewer. A few of the items in the estimate of probable cost—fo??? instance, the amount for repairs of the boundary culvert O ??? X—are put in without sufficient data for accuracy. If ??? should be found that in building houses, &c., over the??? boundary culvert, which is smaller than it should be, th??? waterway has been materially interfered with, considerable additional cost may be incurred. Generally I may observe that in adapting old sewers and waterways, as in remodelling an old house, it is difficult to define the extent of the new work to be done until it is in progress. It will probably be advisable for the Lewisham Board to continue the storm-water conduits in the Dulwich Road to the London Brighton and South Coast Railway Bridge, and to construct a storm-water culvert from Woodbine Grove??? along the Maple Road, and thence to the Green Lane ditch; but these are matters for the consideration of the Lewisham Board. I have indicated, generally, in the Schedule, how I think the cost of the proposed works should be divided between the two Boards. Having carefully weighed the advantages given by each Board to the other, by the existing and proposed arrangements, I think that in order to balance the account a sum of about £125 should be paid by the Lewisham Board towards the cost of the Kent House Lane Sewer ; but it will i be better to defer the exact settlement until arrangements are made for carrying out the works, and their cost is more accurately ascertained, In conclusion, I may mention that the main questions raised for the consideration of the two Boards are— 1. Whether the Works recommended and included in the Schedule shall, subject to modification, be carried out. How far the separation of the Surface Water from the Sewage should be carried, either by the construction of storm-water conduits, in localities already 15 built over, or by regulations for future roads and buildings. I shall have pleasure in explaining any points on which I have not made myself understood, and in giving further information to either Board.
