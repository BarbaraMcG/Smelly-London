MARTIN-IN-THE-FIELDS, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1876. In conformity with the 198th Section of "The Metropolis Local Management Act," the following Report of the affairs and business of the Yestry during the past year, accompanied by an Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure, duly audited as required by the Act, is made. Yestry Meetings and Committees. The Return attached to this Report will show that the Vestry has held 25 meetings, and the Committees 6 appointed by the Vestry have held 21 meetings during the year. Parliamentary Measures. A Bill was introduced in the House of Commons, in the present Session of Parliament, for enlarging the Charing Cross Station by extending it to Northumberland Street, and for erecting a bridge across Villiers Street for the enlargement of the Charing Cross Hotel. The Vestry considering that the Bill would be injurious to the interests of the Parish, instructed me to oppose it in Parliament, by Counsel and witnesses. The result was that the clauses for extending the railway were withdrawn, and Parliament allowed the bridge to be made across Villiers Street, the erection to be subject to the approval of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Sanitary Measures. The Medical Officer's Report is attached, showing the sanitary state of the parish, and the steps taken to improve it during the past year. In connection therewith the Vestry have caused 67 notices for abatement of nuisances to be served during the past year, and 4 summonses have been issued to compel the inhabitants to abate the nuisances complained of. In all other cases the notices have been complied with. 7 Surveyor's Report. Under this head, all the works done under the direction of the Yestry will appear. Conclusion. Bound up with the Annual Report will be found a detailed account of the Receipts and Expenditure of the rents and dividends belonging to the Alms Fund in. the parish devoted to charitable purposes, and distributed by the Churchwardens in the support of Alms Women and Out-Pensioners elected by the Yestry. An Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Poor Rates for the half-years ending respectively, the 29th September, 1875, and 25th March, 1876, has also been added. J.

Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-theFields, for the Year 1875. To the Yestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my sixth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The year 1875 was not marked by the visitation of any particular epidemic. The Deaths were less than 1 in the preceding year. Births. The Births registered in the year 1875 were 476, that is 4 less than in the previous year. Births, 1875. Males 246 476 Females 230 Births, 1874. Males 234 480 Females 246 c 18 Deaths. The Deaths registered in the year amounted to 503, that is 8 less than in the previous year. Deaths, 1875. Males 289 Females 214 503 Of the above 503 deaths, 150 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital; of this latter number, 115 were nonresidents in St. Martin-in-the-Fields. This circumstance will therefore reduce the death-rate in the Parish. The following tables will show the number of deaths occurring in the parish for the years 1875 and 1874, with the annual death-rate per 1,000 of the estimated population:— Deaths, 1875 503 Deaths, 1874 511 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 115 Deduct non-residents who died in the Charing Cross Hospital 117 388 394 Death-rate per 1,000, 18.3 Death-rate per 1,000, 18.6 Ratio of Deaths to population 1 in 54.5 Ratio of Deaths to population 1 in 536 19 By the above figures the death-rate for the year 1875 vas 18.3. This is a trifle less than in the previous rear. The annual death-rate per 1,000 for the whole of London in the year 1875 was 23.7, therefore the ???ealth of our parish will compare favourably with that of the Metropolis generally. Ages at Death. Of the 503 deaths, 152 occurred in children under five years of age, 41 between the ages of 5 and 20 years, 92 between 20 and 40 years, 127 between 40 and 60 years, 79 between 60 and 80 years, and 12 above 80 years. Causes or Death. Zymotic Diseases.—This class of complaints includes Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Croup, Whooping Cough, Typhus Fever, Typhoid Fever, Simple Continued Fever, Remittent Fever, Diarrhoea, and Cholera. The mortality from these diseases is 58. Measles.—There were 2 deaths from this disease. This number is 6 less than the previous year. Scarlet Fever.—Thirteen deaths were due to this maladv. c 2 20 Whooping Cough was fatal to 13. This is 3 more than in the preceding year. Diphtheria.—Two deaths were due to this disease. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. Seven deaths were registered from this class of disease. Two were due to Typhus Fever, 4 to Typhoid Fever, and 1 to Simple Continued Fever. Diarrihea.— Nineteen deaths occurred from this malady. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs.—Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, including Consumption, destroyed 183. This is 34 in excess of the previous year. Disease op Heart.—Forty-one deaths were registered from this complaint. Cancer proved fatal to 15 persons. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed at the end of my Report. 21 Inquests. In the year 1875, there were held 57 inquests. Subjoined are the causes which produced death:— Natural causes 25 Drowning 4 Suffocation 4 Run over or knocked down in the street 7 Burns and Scalds 3 Hydrophobia 1 Injuries received from falling down stairs 5 Pistol shot wound 2 Injuries received from fall out of window at the Charing Cross Hotel 1 Injuries received at the Charing Cross Railway Station 1 Intemperance 1 Wounds 1 Cause not specified 2 57 22 Bakehouses. The several Bakehouses situated in the Parish have been duly inspected. Some few I have caused notices to be served upon the owners for the purpose of limewhiting, etc. Slaughterhouses. The Slaughterhouses are now under the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Mortuary House, Drury Lane. Since this building was first opened, up to the present time (August 21st, 1876), 51 bodies have been received into it. It is pleasant to report that the Mortuary is now being more appreciated by the poor. Of the 51 bodies deposited there since the opening, 34 of them were received during the year 1875. The Artisans' Dwelling Act. In accordance with your wish, I fully reported upon the sanitary condition of Bedfordbury and other parts of the parish, for the purpose of taking action under the Artisan's Dwelling Act. My report has been forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works, who afterwards visited the places, and the subject is now under their consideration. At the conclusion of this report will be found the "Report on the 23 Sanitary Condition of the Houses in Bedfordbury and other parts of the Parish," for the perusal of those Parishioners who may not have had an opportunity of seeing it. Sanitary Work. In the year 1875, 67 notices were served upon owners or occupiers of property to remedy sanitary defects. Some of these notices comprised a large -amount of work to be done. Legal proceedings in four cases were resorted to, the owners or occupiers failing to act upon the notices served. Your Inspector has devoted a great deal of time and attention to Bedfordbury and its neighbourhood, and has at all times promptly called my attention to any nuisance that may have come under his observation. The several courts and passages in the parish have been limewhited from time to time. The pipe sewers have been regularly flushed; also those gullies in the streets which at times emit offensive effluvia, also flushed with carbolic acid and water. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG Medical Officer of Health. 24 Summary of Sanitary Work performed during the Year 1875.

To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, Agreeably to your resolution of the 12th of August last, "That the attention of the Medical Officer of Health be called to the 4th section of the Artisan's Dwellings Act, and that he be requested, with reference thereto, to report to the Vestry as to the sanitary state of the buildings throughout the parish, according to the provisions of the Act." I have made an inspection of the houses and courts situated in the parish, which in my opinion should be demolished to make way for proper and healthy dwellings. I need hardly point out to you the wisdom of the Legislature in passing this Act; an Act, if properly carried out, will do more to raise the moral and physical well-being of the poor than any measure passed in our time. Not only will the poor feel its beneficial effect, but also the middle and upper class; these improved dwellings will not, as the present 32 miserable hovels, be the birthplace of disease and vice, and centres for infections diseases, which are liable to spread through the whole community. Pauperism will no doubt decrease to a great extent when the poor have wholesome dwellings to live in. The terrible evils arising from unhealthy houses, only those who have had experience, and watched the development of the young, can fully perceive the importance of pulling down the miserable dens inhabited by the poor. Steps ought most unquestionably to be taken to remedy the evils and miseries incidental to unhealthy habitations. Most revolting it is to find parents with children, of all ages, herding together in one small room, which is badly constructed and insufficiently ventilated. Here legions of crime and legions of vices unite, fostering diseases of body, weakened intellect, and utter destruction of the soul, leading inevitably to a career of wickedness and sin. I will now commence with Bedfordbury and the adjacent courts. This neighbourhood I am sure you are well acquainted with; it is the black spot of this the Royal parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Bedfordbury and the courts contiguous stand on a little over three acres, and according to the last census of 1871 the population numbered 2,163. Bedfordbury is a long narrow street of forty-seven houses, with courts leading out of it on either side. Some of these courts are blind and very narrow, thus 33 rendering light and air difficult of access. These forty-seven houses are, with very few exceptions, so old and dilapidated, that it is quite impossible to remodel so as to make them fit and proper habitations for the poor to live in. The internal arrangements are such that they are not at all adapted to be let out in tenements. The staircases are dark, thus giving encouragement to dirt; the stairs frequently worn and broken, rendering it dangerous to go up and down; closets situated in dark and confined places, and in consequence difficult of ventilation. Frequently the same cistern which supplies the closet is used for drinking purposes also, a practice most reprehensible. Few houses have more than one closet, and this often in a filthy state. The basements of some are very bad; they are receptacles for rubbish and filth, and emit offensive effluvia, caused by the old and worn-out drains. I would call your attention to No. 37, and 41, Bedfordbury. 37.—This house is occupied by thirty-three people giving in six rooms. On the first floor the two rooms are occupied by two families numbering respectively seven and two, on the second floor the two rooms are tenanted by two families respectively, five and seven, and the third floor by two families of six and six, This house is old and dilapidated throughout, and quite unfit for the large number inhabiting it. D 34 41.—This house is occupied by thirty-six people living in nine rooms. In one room there is a family of six, and in another a family of seven. The banister rails broken, the treads of the stairs worn and dangerous when going up or down, especially for children ; the closet dirty, and frequently stopped up; the cistern which supplies the closet is also used for drinking purposes. This house is in an old and dilapidated condition, and, like the former, quite unfit for the purposes it is used. These two houses may be taken as a type of the condition of the houses in Bedfordbury. I feel satisfied from the general condition of the houses in Bedfordbury that no amount of patching up can ever make them habitable places for the poor, therefore they should be pulled down and replaced by healthy homes. I now come to the adjacent courts of Bedfordbury, the first of which is Shelton Court.—This Court, on the east side of Bedfordbury, consists of eight houses of fifty-six rooms. Six houses contain eight rooms each, and two houses four rooms each. On September 7th I ascertained there were 122 people living in these eight houses. Rents—the rooms let from 1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d. per week. The rooms generally in these houses are very small; passages narrow, about 2 feet 8 inches; staircases also narrow, about 2 feet 2 inches. In consequence of these small dimensions the place Soon becomes 35 dirtied after whitewashing, from the women's dirty clothes rubbing against the walls. Each house has a very small yard in which a closet is situated, and which is always in a disgusting condition. The same cistern is used for the closet and also for drinking purposes. These houses are inhabited by the lowest class in Bedfordbury, and are not in my opinion fit places to be let out in tenements, the construction of them is so deficient; they should therefore be pulled down to make way for a better class of dwellings. Otty's Buildings.—These houses, situated at the rear of 37, Bedfordbury, are four in number, each house has two rooms. The population of this place is twenty three. The court wherein these houses are situated is very narrow and blind. There are two closets for the use of these houses, which closets are also used for the inmates of 37, Bedfordbury. The same cistern supplies both closets, and also is used for drinking purposes. From the general construction of these houses, and the narrowness of the court, I consider that they are not wholesome dwellings. Pipe Maker s A lley.—This court leading off Bedfordbury on the east side, is one of the worst in the place. The entrance to the court is by a long narrow passage barely 3 feet wide. It consists of six houses, three rooms in each house. On September 8th I ascertained the population was forty-eight. The width of the court opposite the houses 3 and 5 is only D 2 36 3 feet 5; the rooms are very dark in consequence of a wall extending as high as the houses. There are t wo closets for the use of the inhabitants, which are generally kept in a most filthy state. The cistern which supplies the closets is also used for drinking purposes. This wretched den should most certainly be demolished. Brewer s Court.—This Court leading off Bedfordbury on the east side, is one of the same character as the preceding one, it would be difficult to say which is the worst. It consists of seven houses of thirty rooms; on September 8th the population was sixtysix. The staircases are dark and narrow, stairs broken, and the houses generally in a most dilapidated condition. The two houses on the south side are chiefly built of wood. There are two closets which are invariably kept in a most disgusting condition. Davy's Buildings—This is another of the courts leading off Bedfordbury on the east side, by a narrow passage 3 feet wide. There are seven houses of twenty rooms in all—population seventy-one. The four houses on the south side are very small, only two rooms in each. There are two closets for the use of the inhabitants. This court, though not so bad as some, should not in my opinion escape demolition. Little Mays Buildings.—This court leading off' Bedfordbury on east side, consists of seven houses, population seventy-one. The basements of these 37 houses are very bad and the closets badly situated. I feel there would be a doubt as to the confirming authority condemning these houses, but in my opinion they should be demolished to make room for dwellings of more modern construction. Chemister Alley.—A court leading off Bedfordbury on the west side, the width of which is only 3 feet 8 inches, and ending in a cul-de-sac. The houses are four in number, of fourteen rooms in all: population thirty-four. These houses are very old and dilapidated, and badly constructed for tenements; passages and staircases very narrow, and rooms very small and dark. Width of passage at No. 1, only 2 feet. Same cistern for closet and drinking purposes. This court should most undoubtedly be demolished. Turner s Court.—This is a court leading out of Bedfordbury into St. Martin's Lane. That portion of the court contiguous to Bedfordbury is broader than the other part, and the houses as regards habitations are good. The other end leading into St. Martin's Lane is narrow, only 4 feet 8 inches. Here there are four houses, the rooms of which are dark and small. These houses should most certainly be demolished as the narrowness of this part of the court prevents access of air and light. Alfred Place.—A small confined court of three houses, leading out of Chandos Street. There are fourteen rooms in all, inhabited by twenty-seven people. The houses are very old and dilapidated 38 and the rooms dark. Nos. 1 and 2 have one cistern between the two houses, which is used for supplying the closets and for drinking purposes. This court is so narrow and close, 9 feet 6 inches in its broadest part, and 6 feet in the narrowest. I should, therefore, recommend it being pulled down, the condition and position of it not being compatible with health. Charles Buildings.—A court leading out of St. Martin's Lane by a long narrow entrance three feet wide, consisting of four houses, inhabited by twentysix people. These houses are very old, but at the same time they are tolerably well kept, and the place is not in a confined position. It would be a matter of consideration for the confirming authority as to whether these houses should be pulled down. Princes Court.— Situated in Whitcomb Street is a blind court consisting of seven houses, of thirty-three rooms in all, populated by seventy-eight people. These houses are all in a very bad condition. Nos. 1, 2, and 3 have wretched basements, the closets most inconveniently situated. Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the same cistern is used for flushing the closet, and also for drinking purposes. These premises, as a whole, are in my opinion quite unfit for human habitation, and should be razed to the ground. Langley Court.—A court leading out of Long Acre on the south side. I have inspected Nos. 1, 2, 8, 9,10. and 11; in these six houses there are thirty-six rooms, inhabited by eighty-four people. Nos. 8. 9, 39 10, and 11 are in tolerable repair; but 1 and 2 are in a very bad condition. I consider these six houses are not fit and proper habitations, their construction not being in accordance with health. Hanover Court.—This is a court leading out of Long Acre on the south side. I have examined Nos. 4, 5, and 6; these three houses contain twenty-two rooms, inhabited by fifty-nine people. These premises are very old and out of repair, the rear is very confined owing to a wall which extends to the height of the houses in the court, and in one of the houses there is only a space 4 feet nine inches between the back and the aforementioned wall. All the rooms are very dark, and each house has a wretched basement. These premises should most certainly be pulled down. Little Catherine Street.—This is a narrow, miserable court close by White Hart Street, Drury Lane. On one side is situated the "Echo newspaper office, and on the other Nos. 1 and 2, Little Catherine Street. These two houses are in the most miserable, wretched condition, and are certainly not fit for human habitation. No. 1 has four rooms (one room on each floor) populated bv sixteen people; there are no back windows, the staircase dark and narrow, and the house generally in a very dilapidated state. No 2 consists of seven rooms populated by sixteen people. This house is equally as bad as the 40 other. I can condemn these premises most unhesitatingly. Eagle Court.—This Court is in close proximity to the last mentioned court. Nos. 2 and 3 are in a most dilapidated condition; dark, miserable basements, wherein are situated the closets. The two houses consist of eight rooms populated by eighteen people. They should most certainly be demolished. White Hart Street.—This street, leading out of Drury Lane, is not wholly in the parish of St. Martin's, nineteen houses and two warehouses belonging to us. They are, with very few exceptions, in an old and dilapidated state. Nos. 21 and 22 are particularly bad. In combination with the adjoining parish a great improvement scheme might be effected in this street. Russell Court, Cross Court, Marquis Court, Vinegar Yard, and the two houses in Red Lion Court.—These courts all running into each other, are more or less confined. Some of the houses are very old, though better and more cleanly kept than some other of the courts in the parish. There is a doubt in my mind whether the Metropolitan Board of Works will condemn these courts, at the same time it would be a good opportunity to take down these houses in this si tuation and construct blocks of buildings on the model lodging-house system. York Place.—A court situated in the neighbourhood of the Adelphi, the width of which is only feet- 41 The houses, twenty-two in number, are most wretched and dilapidated, very confined at the rear, staircases narrow and dark, with miserable, dirty, dark basements, in which in some of these houses the closet and water supply are situated. Some of these houses are as bad as any in Bedfordbury. Nos. 5, 6, 7, 13, and 15 are used as warehouses and workshops by a trunk maker. This court should be pulled down, the houses being so aged and out of repair, they are not fit for human habitation. 1. George Court.—This house situated at the corner of York Place is very old and dilapidated. It consists of six rooms, populated by sixteen people. The basement is bad and very dark. I consider these premises are not wholesome, and should be demolished. White Hart Court.—This court, situated on the east side of Castle Street, Leicester Square, consists of nine houses. Nos. 2, 3, 8, 9, are not houses well adapted for letting out in tenements, the staircases and rooms are small and dark, from the narrowness of the court in this part. The rest of the houses are in very good condition. 2 and 3 Heathcock Court.— These two houses are exceedingly old and dilapidated. No. 2 is inhabited by six people, the other portion of the house not occupied by them is used as workshops. No. 3 is populated by 9 people. The rooms and staircases are very dark in both houses. These premises should not be allowed to remain standing. 42 Lumley Court.—A. court situated in the Strand. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 are very old and out of repair; the court in the situation of these houses is only 7 feet 4 wide, and opposite to them is a large wall belonging to the Vaudeville Theatre, which darkens the rooms. These four houses are populated by forty-three people. I consider they are not healthy habitations. This, gentlemen, concludes the report of my inspection, and in the event of these habitations I have mentioned being pulled down, the question will be: What class of house is to replace them, whether as at present, or on the model lodging-house system? Should my advice be asked on the subject, I would recommend the model lodging-house plan, for the following reasons:— Better supervision could be exercised over the inmates in the way of cleanliness; in case of diseases of an infectious nature the Superintendent of the establishment would at once be made acquainted with the fact, when measures could immediately be taken for the removal or isolation of the patient; and again in view of the great value of land in this neighhood, the model lodging-house system would house more people on less land than the present plan. I have very strong objection to the way a house is let out to the poor at present. The landlord may live miles away, consequently, there is no one responsible for order and cleanliness; if anything goes wrong in 43 the house, it is nobody's place to rectify the evil, and if you ask any of the inmates to remedy anything that is wrong, they will tell you it is no business of theirs, and sometimes they are too idle to acquaint the owner of anything that may be out of order in their houses. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN J. SKEGG. 7th October, 1875.
