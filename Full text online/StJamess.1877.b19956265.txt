JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1877-1878. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, 24th June, 1878. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, This Report accompanying an abbreviated list of the Works executed by the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, from the 25th March, 1877, to the 25th March, 1878, does not embody any very special works, the duties of all having been limited to maintain those that do exist, or to counteract the effects of either necessary, or accidental alterations, or disturbances. Of the latter, there havo been many as will be seen, and as very prompt action indeed is 14 required in every case, a great amount of vigilance is indispensable. The immunity from serious accidents is the best proof that this has been exercised, and there can be no doubt that from year to year this vigilance will have to be increased to meet the advance of the time, or more correctly speaking, to maintain the same speed, if such an expression may be fairly adopted. Probably, no class of work is more interesting, both to those who are, or who are not interested in the result, than Paving Works; being all upon the surface, such Works are matters for fair criticism, and the principle adopted, may, or may not meet the approbation of the lookers on, any more than the individual behaviour of the men actually employed in the execution of the Work. The whole is of necessity under the immediate eye of the Public; which is one reason why such matters become of general interest. The Local Authorities have however to take a more serious view of all such Works; in the First place, Public advantage is the main point to be borne in mind, Secondly, Local 15 convenience is also imperative, and expenditure of money cannot be ignored. These three questions, or almost problems, with many minor ones are of necessity sealed books to the hundreds or thousands to whom a new style of Paving, or even re-producing an existing plan, is merely a matter of a few minutes curiosity, rendering passing opinions of little value. Any attempt to give an opinion as to the various methods of Paving, would be so manifestly out of place, that as your officer, I have only hinted at some of the salient points that make the question of forming and maintaining the "Permanent way" of the London roads, a question that requires the gravest deliberation on the part of those who are really responsible, and there can be no doubt that it is, as a fact challenging more deliberation still. The Vestry of St. James's cannot be accused of idleness, with regard to the whole question, the time that has been given to the subject, is comparatively known to few, and the money, although most economically spent, has not been withheld. 16 Probably among the changes of the future, there will be none more rapid than systems of Paving. It should be borne in mind that the great principle is efficiency, which must first be determined by Material, and by necessity of cost. Maintenance will come to the surface, and will be guided by, or dictated to, by Experience. I trust that these suggestions will not be thought out of place, as the question has become a Public one and cannot be evaded. The Roadways in St. James's Parish are now on the whole in a fair condition, taking into account the work that is expected from them. The Works have been as expeditiously executed as times and circumstances have allowed; as a fact they have been carried on by night, as well as day, so as to render obstructions as brief as possible, time taking the precedence of all other matters. The annexed List does not pretend to enumerate all that has been done, hundreds of small matters, alterations, roughening kerbs, making good channels, letting in coal plates. 17 &c., &c., being constantly attended to; as these are executed by the Vestry workmen, the cost practically appears in their wages. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. Of the Two New Urinals that have been undertaken, only one has been completed; the two were to be situated in Broad Street and Old Burlington Mews. The Broad Street one was brought to a successful termination, but the proposed erection in Old Burlington Mews is at present in abeyance; all that could have been dono, has been done to provide these most essential conveniences. The list speaks for itself, as to the other matters of importance, but the men in the Vestry employ are incessantly at work wherever their services are required, and a great deal is done that would afford very little interest if enumerated; very often a little advice becomes 18 of great value to the Householders, and constantly enables them to proceed in the right way to overcome difficulties. I have the honour to be, Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, ALBERT P. HOWELL, Surveyor. 10 GENERAL WORKS, &c.

Report upon 143 Articles Analysed during the year 1877 55—61 25 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS of The Vestry of St. James's Westminster. Revered Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit for the year 1877 the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, Westminster. The District of St. James's Parish covers an area of 164 statute acres, and the mean density of the population, taking as a basis the enumeration of 187.1, is 205 persons per acre. It will be seen from the tables appended that the general death rate has of late years regularly decreased, and that for the year 1877 the net mortality of the Parish amounts only to a death rate of 15.4 per 1000. The mortality from zymotics in the year 1877 was. reduced to 50. Of Fever cases 55 came under notice during the 26 year; 29 of these were removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals. Of Small Pox 40 cases have come under notice, 26 of which were removed to extra - Parochial Hospitals. The Public Mortuary has been in operation since September, 1876. During that period the Mortuary has been gratuitously open for the reception and disinfection of bodies in all cases where the removal of the dead was conducive to the safety and comfort of the living. In the period of sixteen months, ending December 31st, 1877, seventy-four bodies were removed into the Mortuary. Of these bodies ten were cases of infectious disease in which disinfection was required, and where the removal of the corpse was probably the means of preventing the spread of infectious disease. In 52 cases bodies were removed from the presence of families living in a single room, and where, but for the public Mortuary, the living would have lived and slept in presence of a decomposing corpse, and, possibly, a post mortem examination would have been made before the interment could take place. In 22 cases the bodies have been those of casual strangers,— homeless, or occurring in Hotels or lodging houses. 31 Inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 21 post mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination room which adjoins the Mortuary. The reduction of the death rate to 15.4 per 1000 —the prompt removal of infectious Cases to extraparochial Hospitals, and the now frequent use of our public Mortuary, are congratulatory circumstances. There are, however, in the eastern border of St. James's parish, a large number of houses which, though comfortable dwellings so long as they were the residences of single families, are now increasingly being underleased in order to be let out as tenement houses. These houses are often utterly unsuitable for occupation when every room may be made to lodge an entire family. In such houses for instance a large number of families are at the mercy of some one filthy person who may stop up a water closet or choke a drain, and under such circumstances a most disgusting state of things frequently arises. Dealers in these tenement houses make enormous aggregate rentals out of the improvident working people whom they thus herd together, and persistent efforts on the part of the Sanitary Officers are needed to goad some of these "landlords" into keeping their "property" in a decent condition. There can be little doubt that the clcarance of some of these quarters and the construction of Industrial Dwellings would be a remunerative enterprise as well as a public benefit. My attention has been called to the need of Public Lavatories and Retiring Rooms for women. In the Parish of St. James's, where so much shopping is done and to which so many working women have to make frequent journeys, this need is especially pressing. 28 The fact that women are less able than men to make themselves heard On such a question is an additional reason for my submitting this matter for consideration, and the Parish of St. James's is one that probably would take the lead in making such provision. A small charge for admission would be willingly paid, and it might be that the returns would prove as remunerative as those of the public baths and washhouses. Such lavatories should be in central positions, they might be distinguished by a coloured lamp or other mark which would be understood, and some women's small requisites might be sold. They should contain a room where children could be attended to, and they should be under the supervision of a respectable matron. The Metropolis Local Management Act (sec, 88) empowers Vestries and District Boards as follows: "It shall be lawful for every Vestry and District "Board to provide and maintain urinals, water "closets, privies, and like conveniences, in situations "where they deem such accommodation to be "required, and to supply the same with water, and "to defray the expense thereof; and any damage "occasioned to any person by the erection thereof, "and the expense of keeping the same in good " order as expenses of Sewerage are to be defrayed "under this Act.' Further accommodation is also required for men, and admirable plans for that object were once drawn for the Parish by my colleague, Mr Howell. 29 During the year 1877 the following number of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's:— First Quarter 128 Second Quarter 129 Third Quarter 151 Fourth Quarter 146 Gross mortality for year 1877 554 Deduct Deaths of Non-Parishioners Dying in the Workhouse 29 Dying in the Throat Hospital 8 37 Net mortality for year 1877 517 517 deaths in a population of 33,500 is a net death rate of 15.4 per 1000. In the year 1877 the net death rate was 17.1 per 1000 The deaths occurring in St. James's during the last six years have been as follows:— Year 187 Deaths 680 „ 1872 „ 620 „ 1873 „ 629 „ 1874 „ 592 „ 1875 „ 621 „ 1876 „ 573 „ 1877 „ 554 30 The following Table shows the periods of life in which the deaths have occurred in the last three years respectively. 1875.
