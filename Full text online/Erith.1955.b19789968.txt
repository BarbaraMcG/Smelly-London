The widening of our conception of health in recent years to include mental, as well as physical aspects imposes special difficulties on anyone who attempts an objective assessment of the health of a community. The Medical Officer of Health of the Urban District Council of Erith in the year 1900, on the other hand, could have suffered from no such inhibitions faced, as he was, with a heavy load of infectious disease, an infant mortality rate of 141.01 per thousand live births, and a wide variety of environmental problems which survive only as a faint echo in the present day health administration of the Borough. A comparison with the vital statistics for 1955 shows the extent of the progress which has taken place in the intervening years as a result of improvements in environmental hygiene, in standards of living generally, in the techniques of health education, and through the introduction of a wide range of personal health services. Yet in spite of all this, it would be to take a superficial view to say that the present day health of the community can be regarded as entirely satisfactory. Considerable emphasis is, nowadays, being placed on mental health and there is a widespread feeling that neurosis and anxiety states are on the increase. It is, certainly, true that a very high proportion of hospital beds in the country as a whole is devoted to the treatment of mental disease. There are no statistics on which to base a realistic assessment of the mental health of our community and general impressions, even when they are the result of careful enquiry, may not be altogether reliable. The mental health of schoolchildren is nowadays receiving greater attention than it did a decade ago but this may be the result, not of an actual increase in maladjusment and behaviour Problems, but of a reorientation of medical outlook and an increase in the ascertainment of such children. In other words, higher levels of health are now being sought than in days gone by. One significant development is the widespread and growing use of the class of drugs known as the "chemical tranquillizers" of which phenobarbitone is, perhaps, the best known and which are used to reduce anxiety and tension with a view to making life more tolerable in an age in which 5 it is not, always, easy to achieve that inward peace of mind which is, undoubtedly, a prerequisite of the health of the individual. On a more optimistic note, an important criterion of the health of a community, as of an individual, is the degree of activity which it undertakes. Judged by this standard, the Borough acquits itself well. The official list of organisations operating in the Borough runs into twelve pages of typescript and covers a very wide range of activities with the cultural, social and charitable organisations much in evidence. The cumulative work of these organisations represents a very considerable force working for the good of the community. Many instances could also be quoted in which neighbourly help and solicitude by individuals have made it possible for the old and infirm to remain in their own homes in conditions of relative peace and contentment. It would not be an exaggeration to say that never in the history of the Borough has greater voluntary effort been expended in the care of the elderly and the handicapped than is the case today. Turning to those aspects of health in which definite information is available, the vital statistics for the Borough were, once again, saisfactory. The birth rate at 13.86 per thousand showed an increase over the rate of 13.51 in 1954, which was the lowest birth rate ever recorded in the Borough. There has been no reversal of the downward trend which has been noticeable since the turn of the century. The standardised birth rate which allows for comparison with other parts of the country was also 13.86 and was well below that for England and Wales which was 15.0 per thousand. The stillbirth rate at 23 01 per thousand total births showed a decrease over 1954 (29.69), but this has no special significance and the rate was substantially the same as that for England and Wales. The death rate for the Borough fell slightly to 9.58 per thousand of the estimated whole population (9.9 in 1954) and the standardised death rate of 10.44 was below the death rate for England and Wales for 1955 which was 11.7 per thousand. Cancer of the lung was responsible for 18 deaths and showed an increase of 5 compared with 1954 Fourteen of the 18 deaths were in males. There has been much controversy over the part played by smoking in the causation of lung cancer, and it is safe to say that while statistical evidence does not provide definite proof that cigarette smoking directly causes cancer of the lung, the accumulated evidence is such as to denote a cause and effect relationship. In the circumstances it seems reasonable to advise young people not to take up smoking and, in the 6 case of heavy smokers of middle age, to say that published data indicate that there may be some diminution in risk to those who give up smoking even after many years of addiction. The infant mortality rate for 1955, that is the number of children dying in the first year of life for every thousand live births, was 20.41 compared with 19.32 per thousand in 1954. The rate compares favourably with that for England and Wales, which was 24.9. There were no maternal deaths during the year, and indeed no maternal death has occurred in the Borough for the third year in succession. This is a fine record and speaks well for the obstetrical services in the area and for the standard of ante-natal care available for the expectant mother. In regard to infectious diseases, measles reached epidemic proportions in 1955, 975 cases being notified. There were no deaths from this disease and, indeed, there has been no death in the Borough from this cause for 4 years. The year, also saw an increased incidence of acute poliomyelitis, 6 paralytic and 3 non-paralytic cases being notified. This was in accordance with the national experience in regard to this disease. There were no deaths in the Borough. At the time of writing, vaccination against poliomyelitis has, recently, commenced under arrangements made by the Local Health Authority and it is hoped that the development of this technique will bring this disease under some measure of control- During the year, 47 new cases of tuberculosis were notified compared with 67 in 1954 and 72 in 1953. The number of deaths from this disease fell to 7 compared with 9 in 1954 and 11 in 1953. For the sixth year in succession no case of diphtheria occurred in the Borough. A warning that diphtheria could return as a killing disease is contained in the fact that in certain parts of the country outbreaks of diphtheria have occurred, recently, resulting in the death of a number of children. Parents should take heed of this and should not fail to have their children immunised, as the continued freedom from this disease depends on the maintenance of a high level of immunisation among the child population. Standards of food hygiene, while greatly improved in recent years, still leave much to be desired in many cases. The protection of food exposed for sale from dust and flies, and from the hazards inherent in its preparation and handling, will call for increased efforts by the Health Department, as well as the food traders and housewives, 7 too, have a two-fold duty, firstly, to insist on adequate standards of cleanliness in food shops and in their own homes and, also, to exercise forbearance in the unnecessary handling of food in shops prior to purchase. The new Food Hygiene Regulations strengthen the hand of the Local Authorities but their successful operation will demand a staff of sanitary inspectors adequate to the task. The general shortage of these officers is, therefore, a very serious problem, although at the present time we have managed to achieve a full complement. Cleanliness depends, ultimately, on an attitude of mind and the development of a sense of social responsibility and one of the results of the failure to develop the latter is the widespread litter in our streets, parks and open spaces. It may be considered that this is not primarily a health matter, but its implications in regard to hygiene in general, and the mental distress which it causes to large numbers of people in the Borough, justifies a reference to it in an annual report. Adults are the worst offenders and it is not surprising, therefore, that children should follow their example. There is no doubt that much more could be done in the home and in the schools to inculcate a desire to preserve local amenities which play such a large part in promoting the health of the community. Among the environmental problems which remain, the most important is, undoubtedly, the lack of adequate housing, particularly for young married couples and for the aged, and this in spite of great strides which have been made in recent years by the housing authorities. I wish to acknowledge the sympathetic treatment by the Council of many tuberculous families who have been rehoused during the year in the interests of the prevention of spread of this disease. Problems of atmospheric pollution are coming more and more into the foreground in this residential and industrial area and there can be no doubt that smoke emissions from the domestic grate add considerably to the impurities which are discharged into the atmosphere. Now that the Clean Air Bill has finally reached the Statute Book, the powers of local authorities are, to some extent, strengthened, and no doubt the development of smokeless zones will have to be considered in the years to come. Attention is drawn to that part of the Chief Sanitary Inspector's report on slaughterhouses on page 45. The Council has for a considerable time been concerned at the cost of meat inspection in the Borough and has, indeed, made representations to the Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food that local authorities should be permitted to make 8 charges for meat inspection. In the Borough of Erith most of the slaughtering provides meat for neighbouring and other authorities who do not, themselves, provide slaughtering facilities. The Minister has indicated that everything possible is being done to reach a practicable solution to the problem and that his decision cannot now be long delayed. The work of the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Home Safety Committee continued to make progress. In an attempt to prevent accidents from poisoning in the home, display cards were sent to all doctors and chemists in the Borough for use in their waiting rooms and shops, urging parents to keep drugs and medicines in places where children would not have access to them. A brains trust and film show was also held, which was well attended particularly by senior schoolchildren. It is hoped to intensify this propaganda by giving regular talks and demonstrations to the latter and one is driven more and more to the conclusion, in these days when television and other distractions tend to keep people tied to their homes, that in the senior schoolchildren of the Borough lies the main hope of any future development in regard to health education in general. It is pleasing, once again, to record that the Erith Old People's Welfare Committee has continued to do excellent work in alleviating the lot of many old people by friendly help, by assistance in kind when necessary, by making arrangements for inexpensive holidays, chiropody and in other ways. Their work, to some extent, co-ordinates and is complementary to, that of the many Old People's organisations in the Borough providing clubs and other recreational facilities. The work of this voluntary organisation is of immense value to the old people in the Borough. The domestic help service, and, more recently, the night attendance and family help services provided by the Local Health Authority, also play a vital part in relieving the lot of many old people who would otherwise have to be admitted to institutions. In conclusion, I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement, and the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for their excellent service during the year. I am, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON, Medical Officer of Health. 9 Annual Report 1955 SECTION A:—STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA A (1) Physical Situation and Amenities Erith is situated in the north-west corner of Kent, and is bounded on the north-east by the River Thames, to which it has a frontage of about 4 miles; on the west by the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich and the Borough of Bexley and on the south by the Borough of Bexley and the Urban District of Crayford. The Borough still retains in many places a rural aspect, and views from the many vantage points in the district alford evidence of its undulating nature, and the tree-endowed areas of Belvedere and Abbey Wood. Shopping facilities, though not concentrated, are nevertheless, advantageously situated, and the area is supplied with a copious water supply which is provided and maintained by the Metropolitan Water Board. The chief industries are light engineering, edible oil refining, manufacture of chemicals, coal shipping and lighterage, and the production of building materials. Manufacture of radio and television equipment, and also toys, are established industries. Industrial expansion has progressed during the year and in July the new heavy turbine shop at an engineering factory was opened by the Chairman of the Central Electricity Authority. A new jetty is in course of construction so that coal can be discharged from vessels continuously, and the site of the new Electric Power Station in Norman Road, Belvedere is now laid out. In November, the Minister of Works visited the district and toured a plasterboard factory at which premises machinemade partition panels were being constructed for utilising at newly erected bungalows in an adjacent Metropolitan Borough. The using of this type of factory-made component is said to reduce by £241 comparable costs of each traditional building, and at the same time to lessen construction time from 16 to 11 weeks. 10 Illumination of the principal thoroughfares and bus routes has been improved by the provision of sodium discharge lighting and a new playground has been provided at the Northumberland Heath Recreation ground A (2) Comparative Rainfall 1954 1955 Inches Inches January 1.39 3.15 February 1.93 1.68 March 1.53 0.95 April 0.27 0.24 May 2.86 3.91 June 2.04 1.36 July 2.35 0.09 August 3.04 0.90 September 1.50 2.86 October 1.51 3.71 November 4.07 0.55 December 1.35 1.68 Total 23.84 Total 21.08 11 A (3) Unemployment Figures and Comments With the co-operation of the Manager of Erith Employment Exchange, to whom I am indebted for the necessary information, it is once again possible to give definite figures with regard to the state of unemployment in the district, as shown in the following table.

C (13) Welfare of Old People The Erith Old People's Welfare Committee continued its work throughout the year and much was accomplished in the way of visiting and the provision of good neighbourly services. The holiday scheme has continued and during 1955 175 old people were sent on a week's holiday by the sea. A Christmas dinner and entertainment was arranged for 300 lonely old people.

The dustbins are provided and maintained by the owners of the properties concerned, the Council securing this by a local Act—The Erith Improvement Act, 1920. Disposal is effected by barging under contract, and these arrangements are still working very satisfactorily. D (l)a Costs £ s. d.

Of cesspools, 21 are known to exist and these are subject to cleansing service by resolution of the Council dated 10th March, 1942. Sewers have been extended to take the drainage of newly erected Corporation property on the Lesney Farm Estate, and at Hurst Place. D (5)e Atmospheric Pollution Results of Analysis (a) The Erith Borough Council is represented on the Thameside Advisory Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution. In connection therewith, a deposit gauge and a lead peroxide gauge is in situ at the grounds of the Royal Alfred Institution and the analyses of the contents of gauges for 1955 are declared as follows:— Month Rain in inches Monthly deposit Insoluble deposit Tons per sq. mile Soluble deposit Tons per sq mile Total Solids Tons per sq. mile Calcium Tons per sq. mile Sulphur mg/100 sq cms/day (Gauge set up in July) January Gauge disturbed-No anaysis February 1 29 11.00 7.84 18.84 1.47 - March 0.92 13.3 8.50 22.23 1.70 - April 0.70 8.21 6.44 14.65 1.17 - May 3.81 10.34 8.50 18.84 1.20 - June 2.54 9.77 15.01 24.78 2.40 - July 0.03 13.46 9.20 22.06 1.73 0.82 August 0.90 15.04 10.27 25.31 2.10 1.01 September 2.41 9.79 5.94 15.73 0.13 1.59 October 3.29 11.27 10.81 22.08 1.33 2.71 november 0.47 13.69 5.50 19.19 1.03 2.58 December 1.65 9.17 8.20 17.37 1.47 2.41 (b) Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers announced on 2nd November that, as a result of reasearch and technical investigation conducted by this organisation over a long period, it was proposed to instal equipment which would effectively counteract any dust emission which might be attributable to the Bevans Works at Northfleet. These Proposals are said to involve a capital expenditure of £500,000 and include the construction of the most modern type of electrostatic precipitators. (c) The further proposed conversion of 2,000 London Area trolley buses to diesel engines is a project which will 33 substantially increase the benz-pyrene content of the low level atmosphere. The compulsory imposition of some device to filter exhaust gases of this type appears to be urgently necessary. D (5)f Smoke Abatement During the year, the Local Authority reviewed the many aspects of the long awaited clean air legislation, but at the end of the year, the anticipated Statute was still in transitory stage. There was an absence of "smog" in the district throughout the year. Improvements to factory furnace equipment include the provision of two F.R.S. smoke eliminator doors, whilst at a foundry, a new Pratt Daniel water sprayed dust arrester was installed. D (5)g Swimming Baths and Pools (1) The Council's open air bath is situated in Stonewood Road and comprises one pool of 55,000 gallons capacity which is now exclusively used by the Kent Education Committee during normal school hours, and local youth clubs during the evenings and on Saturday mornings. Water in the pool is heated to a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit by low pressure steam heating and is sterilised by the chlorine process. There is a slipper establishment with accommodation for 16 males and 4 females. Adjacent to the bath is a mechanical laundry which launders on behalf of various undertakings in the locality and which include the Corporation's Catering dept., Works dept., the County Health and Education depts., and the Hainault Maternity Home. During the year, 68,510 articles were dealt with. Attendances at the Swimming Bath for 1955.

The pool is regularly emptied and cleansed, and during the period in use, is methodically dosed with chloros. A successful model power boat regatta sponsored by a local model engineering society was held at this site during May. D (5)h Offensive Trades (1) Fish frying was declared to be an offensive trade in this borough on 17th March, 1939, and bye-laws were made accordingly. Of this type of business there are 13 which are subject to consent under Section 107, Public Health Act 1936. All are well conducted, and the frying apparatus is of approved pattern. (2) Town and Country Planning Act 1947, Sec. 16. Town and Country Planning General Development Order 1950. Evidence was submitted with regard to a Local Inquiry conducted by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government pursuant to an appeal against the refusal of the Local Authority to grant planning permission for the erection of a bone processing factory in the area. The appeal was dismissed. (3) Planning control action and implementation of Part III of the Clean Food Bye-laws resulted in the sale of shellfish being discontinued on a site adjoining a refreshmenthouse. D (5)i Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act 1951 This legislation was enacted to strengthen the law concerning the cleanliness of filling materials for upholstery and similar articles. It applies to all filling materials in general use. Upholsterers (dealers) must be registered with the Local Authority and subject to certain specified defences, are liable to prosecution if dirty filling materials are found on the premises. Manufacturers and storers of rag flock must be licenced by the Local Authority and are subject to penalties if they possess dirty rag flock. Two samples were obtained from the two local registered dealers for the purpose of submission to the Prescribed Analyst. Results were satisfactory. D (5)j Pet Animals Act 1951 This Act contains welfare provisions with regard to pet animals exposed or deposited for the purpose of sale. Of such type of shop, 7 exist and are subject to annual 35 cing. All these were found to be conducted in a satisfactory manner and in accordance with the statutory requirements. In one instance, a shop-keeper was recommended not to keep caged birds on premises which would fail to comply with the requisite statutory provisions. D (5)k Camping Sites There are no summer camping sites within the Borough. The number of sites subject to licencing under Section 269 Public Health Act 1936 has gradually reduced, and at the end of 1955, no such sites existed. During the year, the area has been free from indiscriminate caravan squatters. D (5)1 Hop pickers There are no hop fields in the district. D (5)m Rodent control Two full time operatives are employed on rodent control in accordance with the provisions of Circular N.S.19. As in previous years, each complaint arising from private and industrial premises was investigated for which an appropriate charge was made for destruction. In no case was major infestation located. The 18th and 19th sewer maintenance treatments were carried out during March and September respectively. Recording at manholes demonstrated a spring infestation of 40%, whilst the autumn infestation was 37%. With a view to preventing marine infestations in accordance with the Prevention of Damage by Pests (Application to Shipping) Order 1951, the following inspections were made at the various wharfs, berths and jetties on the riverside of the Borough:— Coastwise vessels 47 Barges 57 Tugs 49 Dredgers 1 Repair vessels 2 Total 156 D (5)n Pest control Though not a public health nuisance, infestation by wasps, bees, beetles, silverfish, crickets etc. can and often does harass unsuspecting occupiers, and during the year numerous requests were received to deal with such pests. This was done at a charge inclusive of cost of insecticides and apportionment charge of the operative's time. 36 The income arising from this service amounted to £29 13s. 0d. Wild rabbits affected with Myxomatosis were located on ground adjoining a factory. The infestation was successfully dealt with. Coping with the ever-increasing number of pigeons in the Old Town area is a problem. D (5)o Eradication of Bed Bugs Vermin infestations continue to decrease and the number of dwelling houses treated during the year was as follows:— Privately owned houses 4 Corporation houses 1 To ensure good control, it is the practice to inspect the household effects of persons to whom Corporation property is allocated. Transfers from one house to another are likewise dealt with. D (5)p Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act 1952 and Regulations 1953 These Regulations came into operation on 1st October, 1954, after which date it is an offence to sell or expose for sale certain heating appliances unless they are protected by effective fireguards as prescribed by the Regulations. Special attention is necessary at second-hand furniture shops where the old-type of appliance may be deposited with similar type furniture exposed for the purpose of sale. In applying the Statute, the probe test was applied to 95 fitments at retailers' premises, all of which were found to be satisfactory. Appliances which are brought to retailers' premises for repair are outside the scope of the statute, and the like exemption applies to heating appliances which exist for the health and comfort provisions of the Shops Act 1950. D (5)q Mosquito Control The marshland area situated at Belvedere and which now is the subject of continuous industrial development has been kept under constant review. In this regard the many watercourses intersecting the various sites were treated with an approved larvicide, and this was wholly successful. D (6) Shops Act 1950 (a) Requirements regarding statutory closing hours were generally complied with by shop-keepers during the year, and no action was necessary in the Magistrates' Court. 37 In view of the growing practice of Television dealers to engage in demonstrations during which the public are admitted to shops from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., the question of serving customers at "open shops" contrary to Section 2 of the Shops Act 1950, was reviewed. Resulting from this, demonstration periods have been amended to an earlier hour so that no members of the public are admitted after 8 p.m. (this hour being the statutory time for closing when the night in question is not the "late night"). (b) Improvements in connection with health and comfort provisions were as follows:— Heating facilities renewed 2 Washing facilities 1 Closet accommodation 1 Cleansing 4 D (7) Sanitary Accommodation at Offices Industrial expansion and adaptation made it necessary for the requisite sanitary accommodation to be provided for each sex at Offices, and in this regard 7 additional conveniences and 5 wash hand basins were installed at certain establishments. All the new fitments were connected to the main drainage system. D (8) Street Trading This is restricted to three stalls sited in the shopping area. No nuisances have been detected at this source. D (9) River Thames—Effluvia Odious emanations from the River Thames gave rise to some concern during the prolonged period of summer heat during July and August, the unpleasant odours associated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas persisting both day and night, and in every part of the Borough. The prolific liberation of gas from marine bubbles rapidly discoloured brassware and other metals. On July 1st, Mr. Duncan Sandys, Minister of Housing and Local Government opened the latest extensions to the LC.C's sewage treatment and disposal works at the northern sewer outfall situate at Becton, Essex. The additional installations comprise 16 new primary sedimentation tanks which are 270 feet long, 75 feet wide and 12 feet in working depth and have a total capacity of 20 million gallons. The deposited sludge is removed front the tanks by 16 Mieder scrapers and chain driven flight collectors. 38 Work is said to be now in hand on the design of similar plant for the southern outfall works situated in the Erith administrative area, and it is estimated that the extensions will be completed in 1962 at an approximate cost of £6,000,000. Local Authority meetings with the Port of London Authority took place during the year.

The dwellings which were demolished in anticipation of formal action were:— 43, 44, 45, 49, 50. 51, 52, and 60, Police Quarters, Royal Arsenal, Crossness. The house closed by application of Closing Order was:— 185, Lower Road, Belvedere. In addition to the above, 30, Corporation owned prefabricated dwellings situated at the Elmhurst Estate, Bedonwell Road, have been demolished. The whole site has been cleared, and dwellings of the traditional type are in course of being erected. D (ll)c Housing statistics Number of permanent houses constructed in 1955:— By the Council 34 plus 108 flats By private enterprise 42 plus 0 flats Total 76 plus 108 flats Total number of permanent houses in the Borough built by the Council 1,226 Total number of flats in the Borough built by the Council 222 Total number of prefabricated temporary houses in the Borough 220 D (ll)d Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954. Section 1 Circular 55/54 In accordance with the requirements of the above, a preliminary survey was carried out as a result of which a total of 140 privately owned houses and 80 Corporation owned properties appeared to be indicative of action under Sections 11 or 25 of the Housing Act 1936 pursuant of a 5 years housing programme. At the end of the year, a certain number of the houses which were enumerated, were already the subject of action by the Health Committee. 42 D(ll)e Housing Development at Northumberland Heath D (12) Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1939 During the year the Chief Sanitary Inspector dealt with 12 applications for assistance regarding standard rents and extortionate payments Appended below is a summary of the improvements effected:— (a) Rent reduced from £1 1s. 0d. to 18s. (b) Rent reduced from £1 0s. 0d. to 18s. (c) Rent reduced from £1 0s. l0d. to £1 0s. 4d. (d) Several applicants were referred to the Rents Tribunal under The Furnished Houses (Rent control) Act 1946, and the Landlord and Tenant (Rent control) Act 1949, with good results. (e) Three enquirers were introduced to the Poor Man's Lawyer. 43 44 SECTION E—WATER SUPPLY—MILK FOOD AND DRUGS ACT—FOOD INSPECTION E (1) Water supply The water supply in the district is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and contains some 30.8 degrees of hardness. Almost without exception, the supply is led direct into the premises served. Two monthly samples have been forwarded to the appropriate Laboratory for bacteriological examination, with satisfactory results. E (2) Milk supply E (2)a Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950. The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951 Since 1st October, 1951 when the above named Order came into operation, the whole of the milk supply in the Borough is specially designated in accordance with the Statute. E 2(b) The Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 and 1954. The Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. The designations applicable to milk retailed in the Borough are limited to "Pasteurised," "Sterilised," and "Tuberculin Tested." By statute, pasteurised milk must be bottled at the premises at which the commodity is heattreated, and the bottles must be fitted with overlapping caps or covers. There are no pasteurisers and milk bottling establishments in the Borough. E (2)c Bacteriological examination of milk The following samples of designated milk from various sources and retailed in the Borough were obtained and submitted for examination:— Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 2 Pasteurised 4 6 The samples satisfied methylene blue and phosphatase tests. 45 E (2)d Designated milk licences The following table indicates the number of licences issued in 1955:— Dealers licences Supplementary licences Tuberculin tested 9 Tuberculin tested 7 Sterilised 32 Sterilised 8 Pasteurised 12 Pasteurised 7 53 22 E (2)e Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 Dairies and milkshops The register of dairies and milk stores records the following registration figures:— No. of registered distributors 10 No. of dairies 5 No. of milkshops 31 No. of milk producers /retailers 0 Regular inspections have been made with a view to maintaining the requisite standard of cleanliness. E (2)f Ice-Cream 123 premises in the Borough are registered for the sale of ice-cream. Of 23 manufacturers entered on the Register, only 5 are active (i e. 2 boil mix and 3 cold mix). Four samples were obtained and forwarded for bacteriological examination, all of which were scheduled at Grade 1. E (3) Meat and Food Inspection E (3)a Slaughterhouses There are two privately owned slaughterhouses in which slaughtering takes place daily, in the evenings of at least three days, and on every Sunday. This constancy of slaughtering at irregular hours has been maintained throughout the year, and the daily hours devoted to meat inspection is equivalent to the service of a full time Sanitary Inspector. If the number of animals slaughtered is increased, as is anticipated in the case of one slaughterhouse, and other duties are equally pressing, the decline of Sanitary Inspectors routine work must soon become most evident. 46 The following table in prescribed form details the number of carcases inspected and condemned:— Carcases and offal inspected and condemned in whole or in part- Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed 256 87 342 932 26634 - Number inspected 256 87 342 932 26634 - All diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci.

Figures issued by the Commonwealth Economic Committee declare that in 1955, meat consumption in Britain was 94 lbs. per head—about 4% higher than 1954, but 4% below the pre-war figure. E (3)b Other Foods Considerable time and attention has been paid to the inspection of other foods at shops and stores as a result of which 1 ton 19 cwts 0 qrs. and 4 lbs. was confiscated as being unfit for human consumption. E (3)c Disposal of Unsound Meat In accordance with the recommendations of Ministry of Food Circular 10/54 dated 29th June, 1954, meat rejected as unfit is safely disposed of by utilisation for trade purposes and animal feeding, the latter being stained with naphthaline green. Cordial relations have been maintained by all the interested parties, and no departure from the approved practice has been observed. E (3)d Slaughter of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1954 Humane slaughtering of all animals in accordance with the above statute prevails throughout the district. The number of slaughtermens licences existing is 9. E (4) Food and Drugs Act, 1938.

E (5) Clean Food Campaign There are 267 food premises in the Borough of the following types:— Fishmongers 17 Bakers 9 Cafes 33 Canteens 13 Butchers 33 Greengrocers 26 Grocers 57 Grocers and Confectioners 27 Grocers and Greengrocers 5 Confectioners 36 Dairies 5 Food Factories 4 There are 207 registered food premises in the area of which the following are component trades:— E (6) Food and Drugs Act. Section 14 Ice-cream 123 Sausages and preserved food 48 E (7) Erith, Bexley, & Crayford Clean Food Traders Guild Resulting from a continuous clean food campaign. 58 Erith traders are now members of the Guild and display the approved plaque on their premises, whilst another 5 food traders are recommended for membership and are awaiting approval by the Executive Committee. Many improvements have been effected at food premises during the year. Since the end of rationing, the hygiene of foodshops has improved considerably. Selective purchasing seems to have resulted in all-round improvement in the display of foodstuffs by vendors in an endeavour to attract an increasingly hygiene minded public. 50 F (4) National Assistance Act. Section 47 The sanitary conditions existing in the homes of many aged persons have been constantly kept under review. having regard to the above statute.
