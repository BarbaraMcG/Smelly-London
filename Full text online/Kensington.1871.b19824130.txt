THE ANNUAL REPORT on THE HEALTH of the Parish of St. Mary Abbott's, KENSINGTON, DURING THE YEAR 1871. by T. ORME DUDFIELD, M.D., MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. london: frederick. bell & co., steam printers, etc., king's road, chelsea. 1872. SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being for the Year 1871. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington. Gentlemen, In my Annual Report for 1870, I stated the population of the Parish, ascertained at the Census taken April 2nd, 1871, to be 121,100—the number originally published, shortly after the completion of the enumeration. This total, as it turned out, included 866 persons, inhabitants of St. George's Workhouse, in Marloes Road, an extra-parochial portion of the Parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. The official Return of the Registrar-General shows the population to have numbered 120,234, a difference too small to render necessary any correction of the statistics in my former report, based on the higher figure above-stated. This population comprised, in round numbers, 49,000 males and 71,234 females: the excess of females over males being no fewer than 22,234. The Parish is divided, for registration purposes, into two sub-districts of very unequal size. The Kensington Town Sub-district has an area of 1497 acres ; its population was 91,583, giving a density of G1 persons per acre. The Brompton Sub-district has an area of 693 acres; its population numbered 28,651, equivalent to 41 persons per acre. In both Districts, and especially in the nothern part of the Parish, considerable tracts of land, in the aggregate probably 500 acres, remain as yet unbuilt upon. The decennial increase of population was 39,673 in the Town District, equal to 76'5 per cent.; and 10,453 in the Brompton District, equal to 57'5 per cent. Total increase, 50,126, viz., from 70,108 to 120,234. (The increase in all London during the 10 years was 450,000 = 16 1 per cent.) Twenty-five thousand nine hundred and sixty-six separate families were enumerated (averaging 4'6 persons 4 to an household), inhabiting 15,712 houses, = 7.6 persons to a house, the proportion in the Metropolis generally being 7.8. Yery few districts of the Metropolis show so large a relative increase of population in the ten years 1861-71—none so large an absolute increase, the 50,000 additional inhabitants of Kensington accounting for a tenth part of the increase of the Metropolitan population during the decenniad. The growth of the Parish has been continuous during the present century, but the increase was much more rapid during the second half of the period. In 1801 the Parish contained a population of 8,556 persons, which, at the next Census in 1821, had increased to 14,428. At the Census of 1841, and ever afterwards, the population of the two Sub-districts was separately enumerated, with the following results:— Table A. 1841. 1851. 1861. 1871.

London 21.2 18.7 16.1 Kensington Town Sub-district 68.0 77.9 76.5 Brompton „ 57.1 22.4 57.5 Table C, in the Appendix, compiled by Mr. C. R. Barnes, Registrar of Births and Deaths for the Town District, furnishes some interesting details of the distribution of the population at the Census enumeration. At the middle of the year the estimated population was 123,110 ; males 50,200, females 72,910. This number will be assumed to be correct and employed for calculation purposes. The increase during the year, viz: from July, 1870, was about 8000, due in part to the natural increase of population by the excess of births over deaths, (1539); the large remainder being the balance of immigration over emigration. BIRTHS. _ Three thousand eight hundred and four births were registered, viz : 3,094 in the Town district, and 710 in the Brompton district. The males born numbered 1,952 ; the females 1,852. The total births were equivalent to an annual rate of nearly 31 (30.9) for every 1,000 persons living, a rate considerably below that of the Metropolis generally, which was 34.5 per 1,000, and which may 6 be reasonably accounted for by the very large disproportion of the sexes. The birth rate in the Town district, 33.4 per 1,000, was considerably above that of Brompton, 24.8 per 1,000. The following Table shows the sex and number of Children born in each of the 4 quarters of the year and in each Registration district :— Table D. Town District, 3094. Brompton, 710. Total. Males. Females. Males. Females. Both Districts. 1st Quarter 431 4 87 9 1018 2nd ,, 371 358 90 97 916 3rd „ 367 378 98 88 931 4th „ 424 356 84 75 939 Total,, . 1,693 1,601 359 351 3,804 MARRIAGES. The Marriages solemnized during the year numbered 1,131, viz: 895 in churches, 149 in other places of worship, and 87 at the Superintendent Registrar's office. DEATHS. The Deaths registered were 2,360, or, deducting the deaths of non-parishioners in the Brompton Hospital, 2,270. To this total should be added the deaths of parishioners in the Small Pox hospitals of the Metropolitan Sick Asylum Board, the number of which, however, I have not yet been able to obtain.* Eighteen hundred and forty-five persons died in the Town district, and 425 in Brompton, the total number being 203 below the deaths of 1870, viz., 2,473. The deaths were equivalent to an annual rate of 18.42 per 1,000 persons living in the whole parish, 20 per 1,000 in the Town district, and 14.7 per 1,000 in Brompton. Thus notwithstanding a severe epidemic of Small Pox, which will be noticed hereafter, the general state of the public health was highly satisfactory, the death rate being below that of any former year to which my researches have extended as may be seen upon reference to Table E in the appendix. Kensington has indeed always enjoyed a good repute for its healthiness ; and to which its excellent soil and the parks in its midst, largely contribute. The Kensington Gravel Pits were even in the last century a favorite resort of invalids, and it was not without reason that Brompton was selected as the site for the leading Hospital for Consumption * After this portion of the Report was completed and when there was no longer time to make the many necessary corrections, I succeeded, through the courtesy of Mr. E. Herbert Draper, the Clerk to the Guardians, in obtaining particulars of the deaths of Kensington parishioners in the Small Pox hospitals. These deaths, 58 in number, equal to 0.5 per 1,000, raise the total mortality from 2270 to 2328, and from 18*42 to 18-92 per 1,000, They are too few to materially affect any of the minor calculations which, moreover, it was impossible to disturb at so late a period. 6 and Diseases of the Chest. The death rate in Brompton was extraordinarly low. Sanitarians regard an annual death rate of 17 per 1,000 persons living as pretty near perfection : and in a list of 50 large town districts, given by the Registrar General in his Annual Summary for 1871, only one (Cheltenham) had a death rate so low as 17 (actually 17.4). The next nearest to it are Dover and Chatham, (19.5 and 19.6) while such places as Brighton, Bath, &c., respectively show a death rate in every case over 20 per 1,000. But the Brompton district, with a population of nearly 30,000, stands far ahead even of Cheltenham, its death rate being, as stated, only 14.7 per 1,000. The death-rate in the Parish generally was 2.3 per 1000 below the corrected rate for 1870, and 6.3 below that in all London which was 24.7 per 1000. For the sake of comparison I subjoin the death rates in the several divisions of the Metropolis, as given by the Registrar General in his Annual Summary:— Table F. West Districts 22.5per 1000, or 4.1 per 1000 higher than in Kensington. North „ 2 5.6 „ „ 7.2 „ „ „ Central „ 25.0 „ „ 6.6 „ „ „ East „ 26.2 „ „ 7.8 „ „ „ South „ 24.1 „ „ 5.7 „ „ „ But although the general death rate was unusually low, in some localities it was very high; whether unusually high I am not able to state, having had no previous opportunity of making a similar investigation. For a knowledge of the population of the several streets, &c., referred to below, I am indebted to the Census Department of the Registrar General's Office. Impressed with the importance of ascertaining the spots where deaths were more than usually numerous in proportion to population, I endeavoured to ascertain the number of persons living in each street in the Parish, but the state of the business in the Census Office rendered this impossible, though information with respect to specially named streets was readily accorded. My attention was particularly directed to Yeoman's Row, Brompton, to Jenning's Buildings, Kensington, and to the neighbourhood of the Potteries, Notting Hill. In a few streets in the latter vicinity, having a population of 4,283, no fewer than 148 deaths occurred = 34 per 1000. Of 258 persons who died in the district in question 79 were under one year of age, and 79 between one and five. The deaths under one, and between one and five, therefore, were respectively 30-5 per cent, of the deaths at all ages ; the deaths at all ages under five, 61 per cent. In the Parish generally, the deaths under one were 25*6 per cent., and the deaths at all ages under five, 43.4 per cent. How favourably the mortality in Jenning's Buildings and in Yeoman's Row compares with the above figures will be seen by referring to the subjoined Table:— 7 Table G. Name of Street. No. of Houses.

It is obvious that Kensington by its special healthiness and the prospects of life, fully justifies the predilections of the fairer sex, who have in such large numbers made it their abode ! The subjoined table shows the number of deaths in each district in the four quarters and the sex of those who died:— Table H. Town District, 1,845. Brompton District, 425. Males. Females. Males. Females. 1st Quarter„ 217 242 52 47 2nd „ 207 185 60 58 3rd „ 259 222 45 55 4th „ 232 281 49 59 915 930 206 219 Nine hundred and sixty-five children died under the age of five years = 43.4 per cent, of all the deaths—a high rate of mortality. The proportion of deaths of children at this age in the Metropolis to deaths at all ages was only 41.6 per cent. Under one year 582 children died, eqvivalent to 25.6 per cent. of all deaths and to 15.3 per cent. of all births. In the Metropolis the deaths under one were 23.9 per cent, of the deaths at all ages, and equal to 17.1 per cent. of registered births. The deaths at 60 years of age and upwards were 519 = 23.2 per cent. of all deaths ; the relative proportion in London generally being 19.3 per cent. One hundred and seventeen persons died at 80 years and upwards, viz., 45 in the summer, and 82 in the winter quarters. In each of the above * Union Street and Kenilworth Torrace are now named George Street. Taking them as ono street, the annual rate of mortality was 42 per 1000. 8 classes the per-centage of deaths to total deaths was higher than in 1870, a fact explained by the low general mortality in 1871, for the actual number of children who died under one, and under five years of age, was lower than in that year; while the deaths of aged persons were rather more numerous. In the Appendix (Table HH.) I have given a comparative analysis of the Mortality in the Parish, and in London generally, for the whole year. Table I., in the Appendix, shows the number of deaths from the principal diseases of the Zymotic class, viz., Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever (Typhus, Enteric or Typhoid, and Simple continued), Diarrhoea and " Cholera." The actual number at present known was 484, viz., 420 in the Town District, and 64 in the Brompton District. Reserving for the present my remarks on the Small Pox epidemic in the hope of obtaining particulars of the deaths in Hospitals, for whioh reason also I have inserted the Table referred to, in the Appendix, I pass on to state that the mortality from Measles (64) was below that of 1870 (70), little in excess of the actual average of 10 years, and considerably below the corrected average—an observation that applies to several other diseases in this class. Vide Table J. (Appendix). Scarlet Fever. The epidemic of this disease, which was the marked feature of 1869 and 1870, lingered more or less throughout the year, at times almost dying out and then again showing a great tendency to increase and spread. The deaths were 95, a decrease from 198 in the previous year; the numbers in each of the 4 quarters respectively, being 18, 9, 38 and 30. In Table K (appendix) the principal places in which the fatal cases of this disease (and others of the zymotic class) occurred are specified, and it will be noticed that many were in healthy localities, on a good class of property occupied by well-to-do people—this malady being, truly, no respecter of persons. The more favorable conditions under which the affluent live give them a comparative immunity from Small Pox, Fever and Diarrhoea. And even with regard to Measles, Whooping Cough, &c.—diseases the fatality of which is due, generally, to complications arising in their progress, complications moreover which may often be avoided by proper treatment and good hygienic arrangements, the poor are the greatest sufferers. But scarlet Fever attacks all classes alike : is most difficult to keep out of houses : and, when once in, its fatality is scarcely greater in one class than another. It is hard to say by what means it is spread, but there is much reason to believe that laundresses are, in many instances, the, it may be innocent, media for its propagation. It is well, therefore, that it should be known that to send infected clothes to a laundress is an offence punishable under the Sanitary Act, 1866. In many cases I have no doubt that the disease is contracted by children at school or at play with their fellows—it being difficult to make poor persons 9 stand that there can be any danger to others when their own children appear quite well. For this reason and others connected with the circumstances of the poor, there is a great deal of exposure of infected children during the period of desquamation, or peeling of the skin. Measures have been taken to make it generally known that such exposure is both dangerous—to the individual and to the community—and unlawful, and that proceedings will be taken under the Sanitary Act, 1866, for the repression of the practice in any and every well authenticated case. Due notice having been given that the provisions of the Act, would be strictly enforced against all offenders, and it having come to my knowledge that one of the most important clauses had been violated (viz., 38, which prohibits the exposure of sick persons in public vehicles without proper precaution against the spread of infection), I took proceedings against the offender, a gentleman from the country, and obtained a conviction : a fine of £3 10s. Od. being inflicted in addition to £1 10s. Od. costs. Whooping Cough was considerably more fatal than usual (72): the deaths from the various forms of specific Fever were about the same as in 1870 (48). It cannot be too widely known that Hospitals have been provided by the Metropolitan Sick Asylum Board, under the " Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867," for the reception of cases of Specific Fever, including Scarlet Fever, but not including Measles. These maladies are always with us; and though it will be impossible, perhaps, to bring the general public to realize the fact, they are of far greater importance in the long run than such diseases as Small Pox or Cholera. Therefore, it is to be hoped that those who are in authority, and Poor-Law Guardians especially, will instruct their officers to spare no efforts to effect the removal of poor Fever cases to the Hospitals in question—than which I can conceive no greater boon to the sick poor and their friends ; or any better security for the health and safety of the general public. Diarrhoea. The fatality of this complaint is greatest at the extremes of life, in this respect resembling the class of Chest complaints ; but, unlike those diseases, it prevails almost exclusively as a factor of death in hot weather. Thus, of 129 deaths ascribed to this cause, omitting 2 cases described as Dysentery, no fewer than 109 occurred in children under two years of age (92 being less than a year old), and 16 in persons sixty years of age and upwards ; the deaths at all intermediate ages being only 4. Of the 129 deaths 7 took place in the first quarter of the year, 7 in the second, 105 in the third, and 10 in the fourth. Without underrating other causes which operate in hot weather, I believe that a principal cause of the greater prevalence and fatality of Diarrhoea in summer is bad food—especially sour milk in the case of infants. With a high temperature it is difficult to preserve milk sweet for any length of time ; and among the poor, who probably do not get the 10 best of milk, nothing spoils it more than the careless, or as I might, perhaps, more justly term it, the ignorant neglect of infants, feeding bottles, which are, according to my experience, rarely kept clean and sweet: and the presence in which of a small quantity of sour food very quickly turns new milk. It is the custom, moreover, to put the bottle into the hot bed with the child, who feeds itself from time to time until the bottle is emptied. This may seem a small matter, but I am convinced of its importance, and that many lives might be saved by proper attention 011 the part of parents. Every infant, especially if brought up by hand, should have two feeding bottles : the one washed and kept in cold water while the other is in use; and the milk should in no case be allowed to remain in the bottle long enough to become sour. Strict care should be taken to cleanse regularly every portion of the apparatus with the brushes provided for that purpose, and particularly that part round the cork, under the metallic cap, where sour milk is apt to accumulate unnoticed. Much good would be done—many lives, I believe, might be saved—if the poor were properly instructed on this subject: for in the great majority of cases it is the poor whose children die from Diarrhoea. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs—not including Phthisis (Consumption) which properly belongs to the Tubercular class of diseases—were fatal in 422 cases, equivalent to 18.6 per cent of all the deaths and to an annual rate of 3.4 per 1000. They were classified as follows :—Laryngitis, 13; Bronchitis, 230; Pneumonia, 120 ; Asthma, 10 ; Pleurisy, 4 ; "Lung Disease," 39. The fatality of this class of disease is greatest at the two extremes of life and during the cold seasons of the year, as shown in the subjoined table, in wh'ch the winter and summer quarters, respectively, arc grouped together:— Table L.

To various Diseases of the Brain and Nervous system 249 deaths were attributed, 60 being registered as "Brain Disease" ; 54, Apoplexy ; 42, Paralysis, and 62 Convulsions. All the deaths from Convulsions occurred under one year: this disease (or symptom of 11 disease rather) being, as a rule, one of early life: as Apoplexy and Paralysis are of late periods of life. Diseases of the Digest ire Organs were fatal in 90 cases : of the Urniary Organs, 47 cases, particulars of which may be seen on reference to Table 0. (Appendix). Tubercular Diseases. 1 his important class of diseases was fatal to 342 persons during the year, the numbers in the four quarters respectively being 58, 99, 97, and 88. Of the total cases 255 were returned as Phthisis, viz., 188 in the Town District and 67 in Brompton. Among the deaths in Brompton I have reason to believe that several were of persons who had come into the Parish as out-patients of the Consumption Hospital. '1 he deaths at the Hospital were 98, eight only being parishioners. It will be seen by reference to the subjoined Table that the deaths from Consumption were most numerous during the summer quarters; the same is true of both Districts, and of all the Tubercular diseases likewise.

Closely allied with tubercular diseases are many of the Nervous System, classed as Convulsions, and the wasting diseases of children. To Atrophy and Debility 86 deaths were attributed, 81 being children under one year. Syphilis was returned as the cause of death in 9 infants, a number probably below the real mortality from this Protean malady. Cancer was fatal to 49 persons, of whom 3 were less than 40 years old; 21 between 40 and 60; 23 between 60 and 80, and 2 upwards of 80. Seventy-six deaths from Old Age were registered. Inquests. In one hundred and forty-eight cases, viz., 132 in the 12 Town District and 16 in Brompton, death was registered upon the information of the Coroner (Inquests) : a number equal to 6.3 of all the deaths, the equivalent number in London being 6.2. In 102 cases a verdict of "Death from natural causes" was returned, the reason for enquiry being, in 83 cases, the suddenness of the death, and in 19 cases the fact of the deceased being found dead in bed. The diseased conditions found upon pod mortem examination were connected with the heart in 29 cases; the Nervous System in 29 cases; the Respiratory Organs in 31 cases, and various in the remaining 13 cases, such as Diarrhoea, Scrofula, Dropsy, &c. Thirty-six verdicts of " Accidental death " were recorded: the deaths being due to burns and scalds in 9 cases; to falls in 3 cases; to carriage accidents in 3 cases ; to other injuries in 2 cases. Twelve cases of " Suffocation " occurred, besides 2 of " Choking." In 3 cases newly born children were found dead, and 1 case each of poisoning and drowning happened. Five Suicidal deaths were registered, viz., 2 by hanging, and 1 each by drowning, poisoning, and cut throat. Verdicts of Wilful Murder and Manslaughter were recorded in 4 cases. Death was by drowning in 1 case ; the other cases were simply returned as Wilful Murder, 2 (newly born children), and Manslaughter 1. In a large proportion of the cases the subjects of inquiry in the Coroner's Court were young children. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Two hundred and fifty-two deaths were registered at Public Institutions, viz : 98 in the Brompton Hospital, (8 of parishioners included) ; 1 at Kensington House, and 153 (males 82, females 71) at the Workhouse, which of course receives its inmates from both registration districts. The deaths at St. Joseph's Home, Portobello Road, a Roman Catholic charitable establishment where some 200 aged persons are maintained, are not returned under this head. Thirteen deaths were returned as " not certified," but I have ascertained that several unregistered and unqualified practitioners of medicine have been in the habit of giving certificates of death, thereby bringing themselves within the penal 40th clause of the Medical Act. J here is no public prosecutor and therefore no one takes lip these cases in the Police Court. I felt it my duty, however, to take steps to prevent such certificates being received in future. I hold (en that were tendered to aud accepted by the Registrar of deaths during the year. MET EOROLOGY. The Registrar General states that the mean temperature of the air at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, during 1871, was 48°7, the same as during 1870, and nearly identical with the average in 100 years. In the first and third quarters of the year the mean 13 temperature was above, while in the second and fourth quarters it was below the average, The greatest defect was shown in November and the beginning of December. The mean degree of humidity for the year was 81, 3 degrees above that for the previous year and but 1 degree below the average of 30 years, complete saturation being represented by 100. The rainfall of the year was 22.5 inches, 4 inches more than in 1870, but still 2.7 inches below the average fall in 56 years. In the second and third quarters there was an excess of 1.0 and 0.9 inches respectively; but in the last three months of the year the deficiency was 4.0 inches. THE SMALL POX EPIDEMIC. The one feature in connection with the state of the public health which for a long period will make the year 1871 remakable in Sanitary annals, was an outbreak of Small Pox, the like of which has not been known in England since vaccination was first generally practised—an outbreak, moreover, that might not unreasonably be termed " retributive," for the perverse neglect of Jenner's great discovery. In London alone 7876 persons died of the disease, the mortality in all England reaching the frightful total of 23,000— multitudes of people being attacked in many parts of the kingdom : and there is no reason to suppose that the epidemic has, as yet, by any means exhausted itself. This most loathsome of diseases had commenced its ravages in many districts in the Metropolis before the close of 1870; but its presence was not felt in any marked degree in Kensington during that year, the deaths (8) being below the average of 10 years (13.1). Of the 8 deaths, however, 5 occurred in the last quarter. Scattered cases, amounting in all, so far as my information goes, to 9, occurred in January, 1871. '1 here were 31 in February ; 45 in March, and 51 in April In May and June the epidemic reached its height: the cases recorded in those months being respectively 91 and 116. The attacks reported in the first half of the year were 343, viz., 234 in the North Sanitary District, Notting Hill, which includes the whole of the Parish north of the central line of the Uxbridge Road; and 109 in the South Sanitary District, which includes the remainder of the Parish south of the line just mentioned. A large diminution ensued in July, when only 36 cases were reported. The decrease was maintained until December, when a considerable rise in the weekly return occasioned much anxiety and alarm. The reported cases, however, did not exceed 101 in the second half of the year, viz., 68 in the North District, and 33 in the South ; the monthly totals being as follows :—July, 36; August, 14 ; September, 7 ; October, 8; November, 8; December, 28. The deaths, which in the first half of the year were 45, declined to 17 in the second. This number is irrespective of the deaths that occurred in the Hospitals, to which about 300 cases were sent. The deaths in those Institutions were 58, making the total mortality during the year 14 from this cause 120, equal to 5T per cent, of all the deaths, and to an annual death rate of 0.96 per 1000, the rate in the Metropolis generally being 2'4 per 1000. The following Table gives, in a condensed form, much of the information set out above :— Table P. MONTHLY RETURNS. Cases recorded in the North Sanitary District.

It would be interesting to show the proportionate mortality in cases treated at home; but we do not know the total number of cases that occurred. We registered only 144 not removed to the Hospitals, including 62 who died : a mortality equal to 43 per cent, on the recorded attacks. Of the 120 deaths (referring to their original locality those of persons who died in the Hospitals) 89 occurred in the North Sanitary District, and 31 in the South. But only 16 belonged to the Brompton Registration District, and the large remainder, 104, to the Town District. The disease is known to have existed in 323 houses, spread over 179 streets or places, the number of cases being as already stated, 444. Two hundred and fifty-six cases occurred in as many houses, one to a house. In each of 40 hoiises 2 persons were attacked; in 13 houses there were 3 cases ; in 5 houses, 4 cases; in 7 houses, 5 cases ; in 2 houses, 7 cases respectively. There were some peculiarities in the circumstances attending the outbreak in Ihe different Sanitary Districts deserving of notice, and notably in respect of the number of cases per house and the age of those attacked, as shown in the subjoined Tables:— 15 Table Q.

The following Table shows a striking difference in the ages of the persons attacked in the two districts: children under 10 forming 37 per cent, of the whole number in the North District, aud less than 8 per cent, in the South District; while betwen the ages of 10 and 40 the attacks in the North and South Districts respectively formed 58 and 78 per cent, of the cases.

That many cases occurred without our knowledge, is clear, for in not a few instances a death first made known the existence of the disease in a house. Tf we assume the mortality of home-treated cases to have been 20 per cent, on tho attacks, it would give a total of 310 cases, of which only 144 were reported at the time. This estimate cannot be far out, and it makes the total cases of the disease 613, and the concealed eases 169. Much public mischief was done and in many instances a great amount of private loss and suffering self-inflicted by concealment of sickness. Is it unreasonable to anticipate a time when this state of things will no longer be possible; when instruction in the principles of Sanitary laws and public hygiene will form a par^ of the code of State education ? Whenever that time arrives I predict that a law will be passed requiring immediate disclosure of all cases of infectious or catching diseases, such as Small Pox, and Specific Fevers, and the instant removal of cases for which the home resources do not afford, either proper lodging or adequate means for obtaining 16 nursing and nourishment. That publicity—by which I mean only information to the Sanitary authority—would be for the general good, no well-informed person can doubt, and in a matter so vital to all it is not unreasonable to expect that personal feeling and private interests should yield to the paramount consideration of the public welfare. The most satisfactory feature in connection with this deplorable outbreak was the conspicuous usefulness of the special Hospitals erected by the Metropolitan Sick Asylum Board under the provisions of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867. The proportions of the epidemic were vast and far reaching, but what limits it would have attained, in the absence of hospital accommodation, it is impossible to say. But we may realize something of the greatness of the emergency in the fact that the Hospitals of the Board, irrespective of District Hospitals, received 12,840 cases in the year, of which 2,351 died,—every one of which, if it had been treated at home would have been a centre for the spread of disease. In local hospitals, including the Old Hospital at Islington, there were 505 deaths, making the grand total of deaths, in Hospitals, 2,856 out of the 7,876 which took place in the Metropolis. From personal experience, I am able to say, that in a great number of instances the speedy removal of a first case, followed by disinfection of the room, bedding, clothes, &c, was attended with the happiest results—the plague ceased. In 256 houses out of 321 where the disease existed, there was but a single case in each. Wherever, in fact, this object was attained the disease rarely spread. On the other hand, when numerous cases occurred in the same house or family, the spread of the disease was generally traceable to the unwillingness of the sick, or of the parents whose children were ill, to avail themselves of the benefits of the Hospital, an unwillingness which, unhappily, was fostered by prejudice arising out of certain ex parte statements made to the disadvantage of the management of the chief Hospital—charges which fortunately for the inhabitants of this Metropolis, were shown to bo without foundation after an exhaustive enquiry, conducted by !he Inspectors of the Local Government Board. Strongly impressed with a sense of the usefulness of the Hospitals and the great benefit of early removal, both to the sick and to the other inmates of infected houses, no pains were spared to discover the sick and effect removal in suitable cases, i.e., cases in which either the want of proper accommodation, or inability to provide suitable nourishment, medical treatment and nursing was apparent. I have to thank the Board of Guardians of the Poor, and their Officers, for the readiness with which they complied with my request for instant information of new cases. The Hospitals being ratesupported admission to them can only be obtained through the Relieving Officers, who, therefore, are usually the earliest to get knowledge of fresh attacks. 17 Table S, showing the Sex and the Age at Death in fatal cases.

For most of the facts connected with the epidemic we must rely on the statistical and other informtion supplied by the Medical Superintendents of the several Hospitals, and I proceed to state a few particulars derived from recently published reports of some of those gentlemen. Mr. Marson, of the old Hospital at Islington, informs us that out of 950 persons admitted during the year 870 (91'5 per cent) had been vaccinated, and 74 (7 78 per cent.) were unvaccinated. Six of the patients were reported to have had Small Pox previously. Of the 74 unvaccinated cases 49 died (66'2 per cent.); of the 870 vaccinated cases 130 died (14*9 per cent.); of the 6 cases classed as Small Pox after Small Pox, 2 died {33-3 per cent.). The general mortality was 19 per cent on the attacks—a very heavy rate, nearly double the average of the past 16 years, due to the severity of the disease, and especially to the number of cases of malignant Small Pox, the proportion of which to other cases—double in the unvaccinated to the vaccinated cases, and all fatal—was very largely in excess of anything within the previous experience of the Officers of the Hospital. At the Hampstead Hospital 6221 patients were admitted, of whom, Dr. Grieve remarks, that 1248 were without marks of vaccination, and of these 638 (51'12 percent.) died; whilst of 4973 who shewed proofs of being vaccinated, 567 only died, equal to 11'40 per cent. The general per-centage of mortality was 19 36 per cent. The disease in unvaccinated persons was most fatal in the young (upwards of 70 per ceut. under 5 years of age) and to the aged, those who were admitted at ages above 60 all dying; but these were few in number, the susceptibility to attack rapidly diminishing as age advances. Dr. Collie, of the Stockwell Hospital, reports the admission of 2288 cases in 12 months, ending 30th January, 1872, of which number 427 died, equal to 18'6 per cent. It was found that both the quality and quantity of vaccination had great influence over the disease, i.e., the better the marks of vaccination, and the more of them the lower the mortality. Vaccination is not, indeed, the simple operation many take it to be: great care being requisite in the selection of good lymph: i.e., from a healthy child having characteristic marks, and in choosing a proper time for the operation, i.e., when the child is in good health: and in the performance of the operation itself. All these conditions being duly attended to, the vaccination will be succesful, proved by large and 18 well-formed or characteristic marks, and when the marks are good, not only is the person less likely to take Small Pox, but if attacked he will be nearly sure to recover: especially if he has a sufficient number of marks; in other words, if he has received a sufficient quantity of vaccination, for it is found that the protective influence increases largely in proportion to the number of marks. Thus at Hampstead out of a total of 644 cases admitted, without visible marks, 357 (54*43 per cent) died The mortality in 529 cases, presenting one mark, was 92 (17*39 per cent): two marks, 1075 cases, 143 deaths, (13'29 per cent.): three marks, 671 cases, 71 deaths, (10*58 per cent.): four marks, 334 cases, 2S deaths, (8*38 per cent): five or more marks, 212 cases, 13 deaths, (6 13 per cent.) To the opponents of vaccination it may be conceded that very many more vaccinated than unvaccinated persons were admitted, but this fact furnishes no argument in support of their mischievous crusade, for it has never been pretended by the warmest advocates of vaccination that it is an infallible protection, but only that it is, in general, absolutely protective, while those who are attacked after vaccination have not only a far better chance of recovery than the unvaccinated, but also greater immunity from " pitting" and other sequelae of the disease. Small Pox itself, as has been seen already, is not a sure protection against a second attack, for many persons take the disease twice, and it has been shown that re-vaccination is more protective than a first attack, both as regards the occurrence, the severity, and therefore the fatality of the disease. Another vital fact has been, I hope, finally established, viz : the extraordinary protection afforded by re-vaccination after the age of 15. It is scarcely going too far to say that few, if any, authenticated cases of Small Pox after efficient re-vaccination, can be established and not one death. None of the nurses or attendants on the sick at the Hospitals ever contract Small Pox, as they are carefully re-vaccinated before they enter upon their duties. Primary vaccination, which in most cases, no doubt, affords a life-long protection, does in many persons lose much of its power during the period of active bodily growth; but successful re-vaccination after the period of puberty gives a sure protection to the end of life in the vast majority of, if not in all cases. Such a fact as this should not merely demolish the position of anti-vaccinationists, but might reasonably be deemed justification for an Act to make the practice of adult re-vaccination compulsory. VACCINATION. Having shown conclusively the value and the importance of good Vaccination, I pass on to review briefly the opportunities afforded of obtaining it in this Parish, and the extent to which compulsory legislation may be deemed to have succeeded. Three stations for the performance of vaccination have been established, and placed under the charge of three of the District Poor Law Medical Officers as the Public Vaccinators, viz.: one in the North District, Notting 19 Hill; one in the South District, Brompton, and one in the Central or Town District. The Vaccination Department of the Local Government Board deem three Public Vaccinators sufficient; but I cannot help thinking it would be well, in the public interest, to appoint every Medical Officer a Public Vaccinator in his own district, as no one is better acquainted with the poor, or able to bring more influence to bear on them with a view to obtaining compliance with the law. True, since the new Act has come into operation (Jan. 1st, 1872), a District Medical Officer may vaccinate or re-vaccinate persons in infected houses, when he is legally in attendance upon the sick, and obtain the small fee allowed in such cases; but I have reason to believe that, in practice, this clause has, in this Parish at least, and so far, proved a nullity. Yet, although I believe it would be better to increase the number of Public Vaccinators to the extent of employing each Medical Officer in this capacity in his own district, I am glad to be able to report much more favourably on the state of vaccination than was possible last year. I then did justice to the efforts of the Vaccination Officer, Mr. Shattock, to wipe off the arrears (1077 cases) he found at the commencement of his term of office; and I referred to the co-operation of the Registrars of Births, &c., who anticipated one of the chief results of subsequent legislation by forwarding a monthly statement of births to the Vaccination Officer—the Act of 1867 only requiring the list to be sent once in six months. During the current year I understand that the Registrars have furnished a list of registered births to the Vaccination Officer two or three times a week, with the result of making that Officer's able and energetic services conspicuously successful, every case being dealt with as soon as the child is 3 months old, and every defaulting case being regularly visited till it is disposed of. Mr. Shattock informs me that he rarely finds it difficult to remove the prejudices of those opposed to vaccination, and has had recourse to legal proceedings in only 10 cases, all successful, for in all the law was ultimately complied with, while at the end of the year the Vaccination Registers were found more free from defaulters than at any previous period since the Act of 1867 came into operation. I am indebted to Mr. C. R. Barnes for the subjoined Statement, shewing the actual number of certificates of successful vaccination received by the Registrars during the year ; side by side with which I have placed the number of births registered during the corresponding period. Table u. Kensington Town Sub-District. Brompton Sub-District. Births Registered. Successful "Vaccinations. Birth Registered. Successful Vaccinations, 1st quarter 840 1270 178 345 2ad „ 729 790 187 212 3rd „ 745 711 186 42 4th „ 780 768 159 181 3094 3539 710 780 20 (Twenty-eight certificates besides these were received relating to children not born in the Parish). From the above Table it will be seen that the successful vaccinations actually exceeded the total births registered—sufficient proof of former neglect of vaccination, and of the success with which the Act was put into operation during the year. The case is even better than appears on the surfaco, inasmuch as of the 3804 children who were born 582 died under one year of age, a large proportion of whom were unvaccinated. For the subjoined Table (UU), I am indebted to Mr. E. Herbert Draper, the Clerk to the Guardians. It shows to what a large extent the vaccination of the population is in the hands of the public vaccinators, those officers having performed 3137 primary vaccinations last year, leaving only 1182 to be divided among numerous private medical practitioners. It shows also that the re-vaccinations at the public stations of persons above the age of 12 years were rather more numerous than the primary vaccinations of infants and young children, viz: 3734.— Table UU.

I subjoin his account of the results. Table V.

The Vaccination Officer, moreover, keeps constantly before him the names of those children of whose successful vaccination certificates have not been received, and the result of his endeavours to have the Act complied with is seen in the large number of certificates received from time to time. Mr. Shattock concludes his report for 1871 with a hope that, by a systematic application and enforcement of the new Act, the number of children marked as " Left " will be greatly reduced in the future, as the names of all children will be furnished to him ere they reach the age of three months, and the parents will be served with notices within one week after that date. I have dwelt somewhat upon this subject because of its intrinsic importance, magnified as that is in the minds of all reasonable persons by the frightful mortality during the year from Small Pox—a disease the most loathsome and, at the same time, the most controllable of those which specially engage the attention of Sanitarians. How great a boon to mankind this invaluable operation of vaccination is—how complete its protective influence in the vast majority of cases ; and how strong its power of favourably modifying Small Pox when that disease supervenes, has already been shown. SANITARY WORK. Table W., (Appendix) comprises a general statement of the Sanitary Work performed during the year. A brief notice of some of the more important items will not be misplaced here. And foremost among permanent Sanitary improvements may be reckoned the abatement of nuisances arising from the keeping of pigs in the Potteries, Notting Dale. This district may be briefly described as a parallelogram, 236 yards long by 147 in width, having a superficial area of about six acres, and containing a population of 1,100 persons, an average of 180 to the acre, the average in the entire parish being 71. At the middle of the year there were probably as many pigs as human beings in the place. The odour not so much from the pigs as from the large quantities of stale and putrid wash—particularly at the boiling hours—was offensive in the extreme, and was often and bitterly complained of by the inhabitants of the surrounding district. It having been affirmed that the health of the residents was good and that there was no evidence to the contrary, it may be well to state that upon enquiry I found there were 35 deaths in the district in 1870, equivalent to an annual rate of mortality of 31 per 1000, the rate in the whole parish being under 21. In 1871 the deaths were 30, and the annual rate of mortality 27 per 1000, while in the parish generally, it was under 19 per 1000. The deaths of children under five years of ago were 63 per cent, of the deaths at all ages 22 in 1870; and in 1871 no less than 72 percent., the mortality in the same class, in the parish generally, being 43 per cent- The known cases of Small Pox were 23. Had the parish generally suffered in an equal ratio from this malady, the recorded cases would have been 2,500 instead of 444, and the deaths 500 instead of 120. The deaths from Diseases of the zymotic class were nearly 40 per cent, of all the deaths, almost double the average in the parish, as a whole, while those constitutional diseases which indicate a low and unhealthy state of the system, were very fatal. That the district was, and still is, in an unsatisfactory state no one acquainted with the facts can doubt, or that the first step in the path of Sanitary reform must be the removal of the pigs which give an especial character to the locality. The efforts made, patiently and perseverinly during many months, were very successful. But it is needless to enlarge upon this subject here, as it has formed upon several occasions a prominent feature in my Monthly Reports. Suffice it to say that about 700 pigs were got rid of entirely, and the styes abolished: their proprietors in many cases, moreover, having migrated to more suitable quarters for carrying on their business. It is computed that not more than 200 pigs, owned by about 20 persons, still remain. This result, it will be readily believed, was not attained without difficulty, and the expenditure of much time and labour. Every impediment that could be devised by legal ingenuity was put forward. Case after case was contested in the Police Court; and in one instance an appeal against an adverse decision was made by the Pig Keepers to Quarter Sessions, but to no purpose. A temporary check was, indeed, sustained in one series of cases heard before a new Magistrate, on the occasion of his first sitting at the Court. But as this decision was obviously due to a misunderstanding, the same cases were brought forward again subsequently and the former decision reversed. In many cases the pigs were removed voluntarily by their owners upon terms of compromise sanctioned by your Vestry; and whenever it was possible a conciliatory course was adopted, in order to make the removal of the pigs and the abatement of the nuisance as little inconvenient to the parties mainly concerned in it, as possible. It would be unjust to conclude this subject without reference to the great tact and firmness displayed by Inspector Langman (in whose district the Potteries are situated) in the discharge of a very unpleasant duty, which involved exposure to insult, obloquy, and, I regret to add, violence. The proceedings taken by order of your Vestry have rendered my department very unpopular in the district; but as many persons have urged " respect for vested interests," and appealed for " time," it should not be forgotten that the proceedings in question have been going on for 20 years—time enough surely; that the present pig keepers, as a rule, have no vested interests being mostly new comers, and that the continuance of the trade in a place long since and often condemned as unfit for the purpose, constitutes a flagrant defiance of the law. 23 The Candle Manufactory and Tallow-melting Establishment, in High Street, known as Messrs. Tuekor's, was as usual the subject of many complaints : and a memorial, largely and influentially signed, praying for the interference of your Vestry, was received in September. Besides the regular inspections by the Sanitary Inspector of the district, I visited the works upon several occasions; and by direction of the Works, Sanitary ana General Purposes Committee, specially reported thereon. The conclusions at which I arrived were, that the nuisance would be almost, if not quite, abated if the proprietors refused to purchase or melt putrid fat; if the workmen obeyed their instructions, and if the melting operations were conducted during the night, and every night, in the hot summer months. The nuisance has been much diminished since September, thus proving the justice of my conclusions, and that the means provided for preventing annoyance are nearly adequate, if duly carried into effect Mortuary and Disinfecting Chamber. The Parish is still without a Mortuary and a Disinfecting Chamber. There is no place for the safe reception of the bodies of those who have died of infectious diseases, the Guardians of the Poor having closed their Mortuary against the common use of the Parish. It must be admitted that they acted within their right, and under the sanction of the Local Government Board in so doing, while, at the same time, they reduced to a minimum the need of such a place by special arrangements with their Funeral Contractor for the speedy interment of persons dead from Small Pox or other infectioua diseases. Your Vestry appointed a Special Committee, some months back, to consider in what way these wants might be supplied, and the resolutions passed in December, 1870, carried.into effect. The Committee devoted much time to the consideration of the subject, but have been unable to make a Report hitherto owing to delays and difficulties beyond their control. Disinfection. In consequence of the prevalence of Small Pox an arrangement was made with an experienced person for the clcansing and disinfection of infected bedding, clothing, &c., of poor persons. This was done with great advantage in 78 cases, at a cost of nearly £90. But as Small Pox is known to have been present in upwards of 300 houses, the remedy provided, it is obvious, was very partial. In all cases where infectious diseases prevailed a notice was served requiring the disinfection of rooms, clothes, bedding, &c., and your Vestry distributed to every house a copy of a paper I prepared, pointing out the agents most suitable for the purpose, and the proper method of applying them. The most generally useful of these agents in the sick room appears to be the Carbolic Acid ; but for the fumigation of rooms, nothing is better than burning sulphur, the resulting 24 sulphurous acid gas being destructive to life. in every form, and having great power of penetrating large articles, such as beds, mattresses, &c. In many hundred cases supplies of disinfectants were gratuitously distributed to the poor by the Sanitary Inspectors, who not only pointed out the proper mode of using them, but frequently superintended the disinfection of premises and articles. I entertain grave doubts of the efficiency of disinfection carried out imperfectly and half-heartedly, as it too often is by the poor; and I believe it would be sound policy to train a Sanitary Labourer to do the work. Such an arrangement will be well deserving of consideration whenever your Vestry shall have provided a Disinfecting Chamber. While the clothing of the sick, and the other contents of the infected chamber are undergoing purification, the room itself should be thoroughly cleansed and fumigated. It is useless to purify clothes and bedding which must go back to an infected chamber. Ventilation of Sewers. Many complaints having been made of the offensive smells emanating from the sewer ventilators, especially at the head of branch sewers, a Special Committee was appointed to consider the matter, and, if possible, devise a remedy. A good deal of attention was paid to the subject, and a deputation from the Committee was received by Mr. Bazalgette, Chief Engineer to the Metropolitan Board of Works, who entered fully into the entire question and explained what had been done to abate the annoyance in the Sewers under the control of the Board. The Committee came reluctantly to the conclusion that no effectual method of dealing with this difficulty had as yet been discovered, and thereupon suspended their labours. 11 may be mentioned that charcoal ventilating traps were applied in localities whence complaints came: and in these instances no further complaint has arisen. But it may be doubted (notwithstanding the admitted power of charcoal to deodorize offensive gases) whether the success of this apparatus may not be due rather to its obstructing the ventilators and preventing the escape of foul air than to any real and effectual ventilation with deodorization. The public have occasionally taken the matter into their own hands and stopped up the offending apertures—a course to be regretted, as it is better to to have a stench here and there in the roadway than the escape of sewer gases into houses; for it need hardly be said that Sewers must be ventilated, and if this is not provided for artificially the resistance of almost any drain trap will be overcome by the pressure of the contained gases and foul effluvia, with all their injurious consequences, find their way into our houses. I am strongly of opinion that something should be done to remedy the evils in question, and among other things I would recommend that whenever a new sewer is built it should be ventilated a t the blind end by a shaft carried above the level of the adjoining buildings. In the case+ 25 of mews, and many complaints come from these places, 1 do not think any great expense would be incurred in providing the remedy even in completed sewers. I am further of opinion that so far from closing existing apertures in the sewers, they might be multiplied with advantage so as to permit the gases to escape in small quantities from many points rather than in large volumes from a few. The carbolic acid powder has been used with good effect as a disinfectant dressing in and about the ventilating openings and the gullies. Licensed Slaughter Houses & Cow Sheds. There are 56 Slaughter Houses and 35 Cowsheds in the Parish. These places were systematically visited upon several occasions during the year, and personally inspected by me prior to the annual licensing day. A careful record was made of the size, construction, and condition of the buildings. With regard to Cowsheds it may be remarked that no amount of cubic space for each animal has hitherto been fixed or exacted by your Vestry. In some parishes a standard of 1000 cubic feet per cow has been adopted. Were such a standard adopted in this Parish, it would lead to a large diminution in the number of cows kept. My experience hitherto has satisfied me that a great deal more depends on ventilation, and on the way in which the cows are kept, than on mere allowance of cubic space. But the question is an important one, and will be kept steadily in view, and form the subject of specific recommendation at some future time should it appear necessary or desirable. Bakehouses. There are 139 Bakehouses in the Parish, and they have been systematically inspected during the year, and the provisions of the Act relating to them duly carried into effect. Removal of Ashes, &c. Many complaints were received during the year of neglect on the part of the Dust Contractors and much valuable time was lost by the Inspectors in attending to them in reading and replying to letters, and in visiting the principal localities from which the complaints came. Fines amounting, in the aggregate, to a large sum were inflicted upon the defaulting Contractors with good results. The Sanitary Staff. The Sanitary Staff was increased during the year by the appointment of a third Inspector, to whom no particular district was assigned. This appointment was made upon the recommendation of a Special Committee, who entered fully into the Sanitary requirements of the Parish. It was apparent that in so large a Parish it was not possible for two Inspectors to perform the many important duties of the office, and to keep proper records; and thus it happened that there was little to show in the shape of documentary evi- 26 dence, for the large amount of Sanitary work undoubtedly performed. Much time was occupied during the year in providing new forms, books, &c., for the use of the department, and it was recommended by the Committee, and approved by your Vestry, that it should be one of the duties of the new Inspector to attend to the clerical work. This has been done very efficiently, as, indeed, have all the duties entrusted to Mr. Rudman, the new Inspector, who has amply justified the recommendation of the Committee. At present it is necessary that the records of the Sanitary Department continue to be kept by Mr. Rudman ; but when the new system is thoroughly established it may be thought desirable to obtain the services of a youth, competent to carry on the work, and thus liberate the third Inspector for more important duties. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the parish during the year was satisfactory in regard to quantity. It is estimated that the London Companies supply, on an average, upwards of 25 gallons per diem to each inhabitant, a very large proportion of which, I have no doubt, serves the useful purpose of flushing the house drains, &c, being in the ordinary sense of the term "wasted," owing to the use of imperfect fittings, waste pipes, &c. The supply in any case, however, must be very unequal upon the intermittent system, as many houses, inhabited by large numbers of poor persons, have only one cistern of moderate capacity for all purposes: and it is very commonly placed immediately over the w.c. Unless, therefore the inhabitants of such houses collect water while it is coming in, the supply must be not only far below the average above mentioned, but far below their actual wants. The only practical remedy for deficient quantity is the constant supply system, which has been found, where adopted, strictly conducive to economy. Under the "Metropolis Water Act, 1871," which came into operation in February of this year, a constant supply is provided for, subject to certain regulations, and the provision of the necessary fittings in four-fifths of the houses in a district. The Board of Works, as the Metropolitan Authority, may require the fittings to be provided within a fixed time, and, on failure, may provide new, or repair existing fittings, at the cost of the person chargeable with the water rate. These arrangements are necessary to avoid the otherwise ruinous waste that would ensue from a constant supply of water at a pressure adequate to convey it to the top of the houses within the district. Dwelling houses grouped in courts may, when necessary, be supplied by means of a stand-pipe placed near them, at the expense of the owner or owners. The Companies have power to frame regulations, subject to the approval of the Board of Trade, for the prevention of waste, and may prescribe the size, nature, and strength of the entire apparatus to be used. When the regulations have been approved, the owners or occupiers of property will be bound, under 27 penalty, to provide and maintain such fittings; and the Companies will have power, if they see fit, after notice, to enter houses and provide or repair the fittings; or they may cut off the water if the fittings are contrary to the regulations; and a house reported by them to the Sanitary Authorities as being without water will be deemed a nuisance, under certain sections of the Nuisance Removal Act, and unfit for human habitation. Heavy penalties will be imposed for waste, misuse, or fouling of the water. Guarded by such provisions there can be no doubt that the Companies may safely and, indeed, with great economy, afford a constant supply : without some such precautions they could not do so. It is not improbable, however that many persons will be inclined to think the long coveted boon somewhat dearly purchased at the price of such extensive rearrangement of the apparatus of supply !* On the subject of quality a less favourable report must perforce be given—so far, at least, as regards the Chelsea and the Grand Junction Companies. The West Middlesex Company upon all occasions supplied well.filtered water: a circumstance due to their ample storage, subsidence reservoirs and filtering beds, which, at the worst seasons of the year, viz., when the Thames was in flood, enabled them to send o.ut wholesome and clear water. Dr. Frankland, of the Government College of Chemistry, who analyses the London Waters every month for the Registrar General, and whose reports, going out under such high sanction, naturally have great weight, gives au unfavourable account of the water supplied by the Chelsea and the Grand Junction Companies. He states that the Chelsea Company abstract their water from the Thames after it has received the polluted Mole, and the sewage of 600,000 people, including the filthy discharges from Oxford, Reading and Windsor. The West Middlesex and Grand Junction Companies take their water from the Thames before it joins the Mole, but below the sewer outfalls of Oxford, Reading and Windsor. The sewage of these Towns is not submitted to any process of purification before it is discharged into the River, and the organic matters which it contains in solution reach the intake of the Water Companies in almost undiminished quantity, and with qualities scarcely appreciably changed. With such water the spring and well water supplied by the Kent Company is contrasted ; this very pure naturally filtered water, being obtained from deep wells sunk in the chalk ; the only objection to which it is open being its hardness. The " hardness " of water is an important element. Perfectly pure {i.e., distilled) water is insipid, not to say nauseous : but water abounding in saline constituents, though clear and sparkling, and pleasant to the taste, * While this Report was passing through the press the Board of Trade deputed Lord Methuen, Captain Tyler, and Mr. Itawlinson, C.B., to hold an enquiry on the "Regulations made by the "Water Companies, and the amended regulations proposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works for the consideration of the Board of Trade." The result is not yet known, but I trust it will be to modify the Companies' regulations, which appear to me to be needlessly oppressive, not to say vexatious, and which would impose a heavy burden of expense upon nearly every householder in the Metropolis. 28 is not free from objections, the most important being its unsuitability for "washing," the lime curdling the soap and causing great waste. In respect of hardness the water of the Kent Company's chalk wells stands at the head of the list, the mean degree of hardness during 1871 being 29.65 degrees ("a degree = 1 part of carbonate of lime or its equivalent) in 100,000 parts of water. The mean degree in the local Companies' water being as follows:—Chelsea, 21°27; West Middlesex, 21°32; Grand Junction, 21°62. The hardness of water can be greatly reduced by the application to it of Clark's simple, practical, and inexpensive process, which consists in the addition to the water of carbonate of lime, chalk, the effect in the case of the Kent Company's water being to reduce it to one-third the hardness of River water, while in a series of experiments upon the Grand Junction Company's water, the hardness was reduced from an average of 21°3 to something under 6°. These results, says Dr. Frankland, show how considerably the polluted condition of Thames water can be mitigated by this method of treatment, and how all the hard water supplied to the Metropolis can easily be rendered soft and suitable for washing and cleansing purposes. Dr. Frankland expresses preference for deep well water, which, moreover, is of a much more uniform temperature than river water, the extreme range observed during the year in the Kent Company's water being 11° (from 48°9 to 59°9) ; the Thames water having a range of 33°7 (viz., from 37° to 70°7), and being during hot weather " so warm as to be nauseous to the palate." The amount of organic matter, the worst form of impurity occuring in potable water, especially such as is of animal origin, present in Thames water, is much in excess of that contained in that of the Kent Company, as shown in the subjoined Table, the Kent Company's water being taken as a standard of comparison:— Table X Maximum, Minimum, Average. Kent 1 1 1 West Middlesex 9.7 2.8 5.8 Chelsea 17.5 3.4 6.3 Grand J unction 17.4 3.6 6.5 Southwark and Vauxliall 15.1 3.7 7.5 The following Table shows the condition in respect of clearness or turbidity of the local Companies' water:— Table Y. Name of Company. Number of occasions when clear & transparent. Number of occasions whensliglit ly turbid. Ditto Turbid. Do very Turbid. Chelsea 10 2 1 2 West Middlesex 15 0 0 0 Grand Junction 11 1 3 0 29 Dr. Frankland observes that the suspended matters in turbid water generally abounded with moving organisms, and that his microscopical examinations have shown the presence of these organisms in most of the turbid samples delivered (inter alia†by the Chelsea and Grand Junction Companies. No reference is made to the discovery of any such bodies in the clear water of the West Middlesex Company. Dr. Frankland's principal objections to River water may be summed up as follows:—It is often turbid, i.e., dirty, and it then contains "living and moving organisms," which are absent in well filtered water; and the presence of which in water polluted with sewage implies the possibility of the presence of those zymotic germs which are not recognizable by the microscope, but which are believed by almost all our physiological and medical authorities to be the cause of epidemic disease. It contains solid matter, some of which, if not always noxious, is at any moment liable to become so, the rest being useless in potable water, and the greater part of it acting injuriously in the operations of washing and cleansing. All this he describes as "total solid impurity," one portion of it, moreover, being further described as "previous sewage or animal contamination" due to the actual introduction of vast quantities of sewage into the Thames (besides the washings of animal manure from a large area of cultivated land) which reaches the intake of the Water Companies before the animal matter is destroyed. But there is another side to the question, and it is ably handled by Dr. Letheby, Medical Officer of Health to the City of London, in his last Annual Report. He admits the occasional turbidity of the water as supplied by the Chelsea and Grand Junction Companies—he found it turbid on 8 occasions (monthly examinations) in 1871; but then, he says, that the turbidity is due "to the presence of a very small quantity of finely divided clay, in which there was occasionally a trace of vegetable tissue, and no doubt it had been caused by the heavy floods of the River." He condemns vigorously the "very alarming language" of Dr. Frankland in describing the condition of the water, and quotes Major Bolton, the Water Examiner appointed by the Board of Trade, who admits the occasional turbidity of the water, and the presence of living organisms, but attaches little importance to them; further observing that "it is to be regretted that such terms as 'living organisms' have been used so frequently and so idefinitely," for not only do they exist in all water, but "it is impossible to get rid of the simplest forms of vegetable and animal life, which should be understood by such terms, even by the most perfect filtration," and he quotes the Report of the Royal Commission to the effect that "in the present state of Chemical Science analysis fails to discover in properly filtered Thames water anything positively deleterious to health. Whatever may be the difference of opinion with respect to the time required for removal of all objectionable organic matter, all Chemists agree that in Thames water taken from the present source and properly filtered, 30 all such matter has disappeared, and that the resulting compounds, such as nitrates, &c., remaining therein, are innocuous and harmless." Dr. Letheby, moreover, objects to the use of the phrase "previous sewage contamination," for it implies not that sewage or organic matter is contained in the water, but that the metamorphosed elements of these matters are present, "and so they are in all the food we eat." The testimony of other Chemists is cited in support of the views of Dr. Letheby, and in opposition to Dr. Frankland. Objection is taken also to other terms employed by Dr. Frankland, and countenanced by the Registrar General. But into these I need not enter, my object being to state, as briefly aud as clearly as possible, the arguments employed on both sides of a question second to none in importance to the inhabitants of the Metropolis. I shall not presume to decide on scientific points where authorities so eminent differ so widely; but I may be permitted to observe that it is unreasonable to expect people to drink dirty water, when, if the Act which gives the Companies a profitable monopoly were carried out properly, they might, at least, have clean water. The Metropolis Water Act was passed in 1852. One of its chief provisions has reference to filtration, and the blame of dirty water mainly rests with the Board of Trade, for not enforcing the clause in question. As a practical question I believe that River water would be good and wholesome, and might be used with safety and advantage, if properly treated, but that its value would be increased if it were purified and softened by Clark's process. What is wanted is a Law to prevent the contamination of rivers by town sewage on the one hand; and to enforce the due carrying out of existing law on the other hand, by compelling offending Companies to provide ample storage, so as to render them independent of floods. They, or several of them, are now constrained to take in water constantly, whatever the condition of the River, and the water often contains suspended solid matter for which time cannot be allowed for subsidence, and which the filtering beds are inadequate to remove. In the case of the Chelsea Company, moreover, the intake is too low down the River. The fault is admited : it is no new one; why was it not removed as soon as recognized ? But there is one cause of bad water which must not be overlooked not attributed to the Companies. I allude to the use of improper and dirty receptacles—a subject to which I have taken occasion to refer more than once in my Monthly Reports. There is much, and too general, neglect of cisterns, which are often left without covers, and suffered to go for months without cleansing. In some cases they can't be emptied at all, and frequently they are placed out of reach of easy observation, and have an untrapped connection by means of the waste pipe with the house drains and sewers. Under these conditions the purest water must needs be contaminated, No cistern should be allowed to go more than a month without cleansing; it should be well covered, have an overflow pipe, and 31 no connection with the drain or other source of impurity; while the supply of drinking water, and that used for culinary purposes generally, should be distinct from that of the water closet. GAS.

No examination of the Gas was made during the year at the Vestry Hall, the testing room and apparatus being out of order from long disuse. Favourable as the return is, for it shows an average illuminating power considerably above the required standard of 20 candles, it would be useless to deny that much dissatisfaction with the Gas has been felt and expressed, both in the Vestry Hall and in the Parish generally. A Special Committee was appointed in consequence to consider the entire question; but after much enquiry and personal communication with the Secretary and the Engineer of the Company, was unable to make any very definite report, or to controvert the statements of the Company, showing that the Gas was as to its illuminating power and its purity, quite equal to, and indeed above, the requirements of the Gas Act of 1860, which still governs the supply of Gas over one-half the Metropolis, including the Parish of Kensington. The Committee, however, recommended an application to the Company to furnish a Monthly Statement, showing the daily illuminating power of the Gas, and the mean quantity of sulphur during the month. They also recommended the repair and 32 employment of the apparatus in the testing room at the Vestry Hall. The Company readily complied with the request of your Vestry, and have during the current year supplied the information asked for. The Gas has also been periodically tested at the Vestry Hall, on an average two or three times a week. The result hitherto has shown no very wide discrepancy between Mr. Valentin's returns and my own, the Gas having been on nearly all occasions above the required standard of 20 candles. In conclusion, I beg to refer to the Surveyor's Report for particulars of the sewers built, ventilated, cleansed and flushed, and the number of houses drained, and new gullies made, during the year. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your very obedient Servant, T. ORME DUDFIELD, M.D , Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Kensington, June, 1872. A PPENDIX. Table E.
