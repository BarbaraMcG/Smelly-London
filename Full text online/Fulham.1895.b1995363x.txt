Williams and Rev. C. Spooner were appointed the deputation to wait upon the London County Council. The deputation waited on the Council on the 3rd July, 1895, and argued in support of the Council carrying out this work as a Metropolitan Improvement; and at the Vestry meeting held on the same evening the Clerk was instructed to write the London County Council informing them that the scheme at present suggested would not interfere with Mr. Whiteley's buildings, as shown by the plan deposited by Mr. Stuart-Barker, which letter was written, but up to the end of the year no reply had been received from the County Council. 22 Drainage of. Earl's Court Exhibition. The Vestry and its Works Committee had a great deal of its time occupied during 1895 by discussions on the state of the drainage of the Earl's Court Exhibition The Works Committee appointed a Sub-Committee, consisting of Messrs A. Williams, Steel, Marks and Thomas, to accompany the Drainage Inspector and Chief Outdoor Assistant to see the drains properly tested. and the Sub-Committee accordingly attended at the Exhibition for that purpose. After having thoroughly tested all the drains in the Exhibition, the Sub-Committee prepared voluminous reports, setting out the action they had taken, and containing reports of the Drainage Inspector, Chief Outdoor Assistant and Surveyor, together with copies of the correspondence which had passed between the officials of the Exhibition and the Vestry thereon which reports formed the subject of debate at the Works Committee on many occasions. However, on the 4th December, 1895, the final report was adopted by the Committee, and, on the 11th December, 1895, presented to the Vestry, with the following result:— "That having fully considered the report of the Sub-Committee appointed to examine the drainage at the Earl's Court Exhibition, we express our approval of the same, and now recommend that the necessary work be completed as early as possible, and that the thanks of this Vestry be accorded to Messrs. Marks, Thomas, Steel and A. Williams for their services so ably rendered in connection with the inspection of the drainage. We further recommend that it be referred to the Sanitary Committee to make a thorough examination and serve notices as to the Vestry's requirements." An amendment was moved by Mr. Thomas, seconded by Mr. Marks, "That before making his Report No. 11, on page 7 of the reports on the drainage of the Empire of India Exhibition (on which the Surveyor says he based his Report No. 12) the Chief Outdoor Assistant should have satisfied himself that such report was true in substance and in fact. That he did not do so has been amply proved by subsequent examinations and reports, and the Chief Outdoor Assistant having failed in his clear duty to this Vestry, he be and is hereby censured." On being put to the vote the amendment was declared lost, when a division was claimed with the following result:— For the amendment:—Messrs. Comben, Cranfield, Greig, Hobbs, E.J. Lee, Maloney, O'Brien, Sayer and Terry. Tellers, Messrs. Marks and Thomas—11. Against:—Messrs. Atkinson, Beal, Brand, Cook, Curtis, Devine, Drew, Foreman, Haines, Knight, Lacey, Lewen, Manby, Marchment, Millbank, Moseley, Palmer, Parker, Pendlebury, Rooth, Squires, Steel, Thelwall, S. White, A. Williams, Wingrave and Woods and Dr. Lee. Tellers, Mr. Beal and Dr. Hill—30. The amendment was declared lost, and the motion was put and carried. In accordance with the above resolution, the Medical Officer of Health, by direction of the Sanitary Committee, has served the requisite notices and the Exhibition Company have been carrying out the work in accordance therewith. 23 Proceedings against Contractors.

Cranfield, Curtis, Lacey, Knight and Parker were re-elected Overseers for the ensuing year, and Mr. Frank Adams was elected an Overseer in the room of Mr. Ascott, retired. 24 Removal of swings Recreation Ground. In consequence of the swings being principally used by young men and women, the children being thereby prevented from having the proper use of them, the Vestry resolved, that they be taken down, and the swings have been removed accordingly. Bandstand. Messrs. Lovibond's Dana having expressed their willingness to play once a week at the Recreation Ground if the Vestry would have the band stand covered, and provide music stands, the Vestry resolved to cover the bandstand and provide music stands, as suggested. Enquiry into working of Sanitary Department. On the 18th September, 1895, Vestry, on the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, confirmed the appointment of a Sub-Committee, consisting of the Chairman of the Committee, Dr. J. R. Hill and Messrs. Drew, Jewson, Marks and C. J. Williams, to enquire into the work of the officers of the Sanitary Department, and that Sub-Committee, after having held several meetings and received a report from the Medical Officer of Health as to the work of the various officers of his department, submitted the following report to the Sanitary Committee on the 2nd December, who approved same, and recommended it to the Vestry for adoption, by whom it was, on the nth December, confirmed:— 1. From time to time the attention of the Vestry has been unpleasantly drawn to the friction, the delays, the unsatisfactory results, and the unnecessary expense to the property-holders, resulting from the dual control in regard to House Drainage Reconstructions. We are strongly of opinion that the whole of such works should be carried out by the Officers of the Sanitary Committee under the supervision of its Medical Officer of Health, and we also recommend that one of the Drainage Inspectors be transferred from the Works to the Sanitary Department, so as to supervise and be responsible under the Medical Officer of Health for the proper carrying out of the house drainage works ordered by the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry. This is the more desirable as the Surveyor is already over whelmed with detail work, which would thus, in part, be removed to the Medical Officer of Health—whose duties, we gather upon enquiry, to be by no means of a continuous character. 2. Whilst we are of opinion that the Sanitary Inspectors carry out their functions in a thorough and earnest manner; and whilst we recognise that their position under the Public Health and other Acts, as well as by the Vestry's Bye-laws, requires them, in many cases, to report and act under the Sanitary Authority immediately, we have clearly recognized that there is a loss of purpose, owing to a certain lack of direction and control by the Medical Officer of Health. We, therefore, advise that the Sanitary Inspectors and the Drainage Inspector proposed to be transferred shall report daily to the Medical Officer of Health, on forms to be kept in books—separately assigned to each Inspector—as to their work on the previous day (see Form appended "A"). 25 The Medical Officer of Health should also more closely direct and supervise their duties, and should be more responsible than at present for the working of the department, as, indeed, was, we believe, contemplated by the Vestry ??? appointing a Medical Officer of Health for whole—instead of part—time. 3. The Sanitary Clerk is engaged from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., except on Saturdays, when he ceases work at 2 p.m. He is allowed an hour for lunch. His working hours are thus 40 only per week. We propose that his hours shall be extended by an hour each day, except Saturday, and that he shall no longer be required to attend the Sanitary Committee, where he is not eeded. We think that for the extra service he should be allowed £10 additional per annnm. With this increase of clerical power, and with the very considerable ghtening of the Sanitary Clerk's present work, which we detail below, we Confidently state that not only the present merely clerical work can be done, but that no inconsiderable part of the copying and formal book entries at present performed by the Sanitary Inspectors can be carried out by Mr. larke, thus setting free the Sanitary Inspectors for more important duties. a. Forms of letters should be as largely as possible printed, with blanks for insertions of details. The forms now in use are few, and could well be increased in number. b. The duplicate Intimations which in future will be brought before the Sanitary Committee should be copied by the Sanitary Clerk from the notices served by the Sanitary Inspectors. The Form "A" shall be written as now by the Sanitary Clerk and checked and signed by the Inspectors. c. The Continuous Record of Inspections Book, on which so much time (about two days a week) is now spent, is, in part, a simple repetition of the information given on the counterfoil of the Intimation Book. With details inserted on the counterfoils showing the decisions of the Sanitary Authority, and how the works have been carried out, &c., as set forth on Form "B" appended hereto, the requirements of the Public Health Act will be complied with, and much of the Sanitary Clerk's time saved. The Intimation Book should be indexed for simplicity of reference. d. The work sheets might be written up by the Sanitary Clerk instead of by the Sanitary Inspectors. e. Notices to Schools, &c., counterfoils should be numbered merely, and the details omitted. 4. Fee and other similar Books should be initialled and dated by the Medical Officer of Health. There should also be checks as to the different forms having been sent out. Whoever is responsible should invariably itial and date the items in the books. We are thus of opinion, in answer to your reference, that a Junior Clerk ill not be necessary. We also recommend that the Sanitary Inspectors should leave the ommittee Room as soon as their Sanitary reports shall have been 26 sidered, which should be at the earliest possible time after the reading ??? the minutes. We are strongly of opinion that these alterations will strengthen and improve the working of the Sanitary Department of the Vestry and enable the work to be done more easily, more effectively, and more rapidly, whils lessening the cost and annoyance to the public in carrying out Sanitar works. The additional cost would be really trifling. All officers of the Sanitary Department have vied in assisting us in our inquiries. "A." THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM.

On the 22nd April, 1896, the Vestry made the following Standing Order (p 64), viz.:— ???ding Order made. "3. If any Vestryman shall be guilty of unseemly, rude or violent behaviour, which disturbs or interrupts the progress of the business or proceedings of the Vestry or by Committee thereof, or shall thereat make any noise or use any language as to cause any annoyance, the Chairman may, of his own accord, or on his attention being called thereto, call upon the Vestryman so offending apologise for his offence. Should the Vestryman fail to do so in a manner tisfactory to the Chairman, the latter shall name him, and it shall thereon be competent for any Vestryman to move that the Vestryman so med be suspended from the service of the Vestry or Committee for that ieting. The Chairman shall, after opportunity has been given to the ending Vestryman to explain to the satisfaction of the Chairman, forthwith t such motion without amendment, adjournment, or debate. Upon such ???tion being carried, the offending Vestryman shall immediately withdraw ???m the meeting." Confirmation of. which was confirmed at the subsequent meeting of the Vestry held on the 6th May, 1896. Street Improvements. The following Street Improvements have been under consideration by ??? Vestry since March, 1895:— Fulham Road. Widening between Fire Station and Messrs. Stansfeld's By direction of the Vestry the Surveyor prepared a report giving his valuation of the various interests in the forecourts, &c., required to widen the Fulham Road between the Fire Station and Messrs. Stansfeld's, which was referred to the Solicitor to report upon; but as it appeared that, m the prices asked by the various owners, the improvement would cost ???siderably more than the original estimate, it was resolved that the London ???unty Council be approached with a view to their increasing the amount of ???eir promised contribution. The Council were written to accordingly, but to the time of preparing this report the Vestry had not received the ???ision of the Council thereon. Widening between _ Library and Wheatsheaf Alley. In May, 1895, the Vestry resolved that the London County Council be requested to receive a deputation from the Vestry with reference to the widening of Fulham Road between the Library and Wheatsheaf Alley (a favourable portunity having arisen to effect an improvement there), and that in the ???ent of the Council agreeing to assist the Vestry the improvement be ???ried out, and the following gentlemen were appointed to serve on the mutation:—Messrs. Williams, Harrison, Boyton, Comben, Green, Sayer, rry and Whiteley and the Rev. C. Spooner. The Council having agreed receive a deputation, they waited on the Council, by appointment, on the ???h September, 1895, when the matter was fully set before the Council by Tom Green on behalf of the Vestry. Negociations were also entered ??? between the Officers of the Vestry and the Surveyor employed on 28 behalf of the owners of the property, but in consequence of the price asked for the land required for the improvement being so very much in excess o the Vestry's Surveyor's valuation, the Vestry resolved to carry out the improvement under the provisions of Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, and instructed their Solicitor and Surveyor accordingly, and the plan of the proposed widening was sealed on the 1st January, 1896. Notices to treat were duly sealed by the Vestry on the 15th January, 1896, and served by the Solicitor on the Right Rev. Mgr. Fenton, the Rev. J. S. Sinclair, M A., J.P. and Miss Byrne, on the 20th January, 1896, and the Vestry appointed Messrs. Fuller & Fuller, Valuers, of 70, Queen Street, E.C., to act in their behalf in this matter. At the date of this report negociations were pending in this matter. Line of Frontage and Widening by Munster Road. On the 3rd July, 1095, the Vestry instructed their Solicitors to proceed with the appeal against the Superintendent Architect's definition of the general line of buildings in Fulham Road by Munster Road, and on the 18th September, 1895, the Solicitor reported that the Tribunal of Appeal had confirmed the Superintendent Architect's report, and dismissed the appeal The Vestry thereupon on the 16th October, 1895, resolved to carry out the Improvement at the corner of Munster Road under the provisions o Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, and instructed their Solicitor and Surveyor to that effect. The Clerk was also instructed to apply to the London Country Council for their sanction to the Improvement, and also for a contributior towards the cost of effecting the same, and the plan of the proposed widening was on the 4th December, 1895, sealed by the Vestry. On the 11th December, 1895, the Solicitor reported that the respondent's costs in the matter of the line of frontage were delivered at the sum of £52 19s. 4d. and were taxed by Master Pollock down to 4s.; also that with regard to the improvement, he had served notices upon the freeholders, and upon Messrs. Lea & Grace in accordance with the Vestry's resolution of the 4th inst, but had not up to that date received the claims pursuant to the notice. The freeholder and leaseholders having protested against the Vestry withdrawing the notice to treat served pursuant to resolution of Vestry on 16th October, 1895, and substituting that served under the resolution ??? 4th December, 1895, the Solicitor was instructed to see the interested parties with a view to some agreement being come to, and power was given him to take Counsel's opinion if necessary. On the 15th January, 1896, the Solicitor reported he had been unable to meet the owners of the property with the view to an amicable arrangement, and had therefore taken the opinion of Mr. Channel, Q.C., which he produced, and the Vestry resolved to proceed in accordance with such opinion. A sealed tender on behalf of the Vestry was duly served on the leaseholders, and as the offer contained therein was declined, a Precept to the Sheriff, calling upon him to summon a jury to assess the compensation payable to such leaseholders, has been sealed by the Vestry and duly served. North End Road. Improvement by Fane Street. The Vestry having resolved to carry out the Improvement in North End Road by Fane Street, under the provisions of Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, the Solicito and Surveyor were accordingly instructed to carry the matter through, and the Clerk was directed to make application to the London County Council for their consent to the widening between Nos 180 and 196, and for a contribution of half the cost of effecting the Improvement 29 Notices to treat were duly served, and tenders sealed and made to the different owners in respect of their interests. One of the persons interested (the owner of No. 182), having declined to accept the Vestry's tender, the Sheriff, at the request of the Vestry, summoned a jury to assess compensation, who viewed the premises on the 13th March, 1896, and at the trial on the 14th March, 1896, assessed the compensation to be paid at £26. As that sum was less than the Vestry had previously tendered, the owner in question had to pay the Vestry's costs in accordance with section 82 of the above mentioned Act, and the widening has now been carried out. Widening by Beaufort House. The Surveyor having been instructed to prepare a plan and an estimate of the cost of acquiring the necessary land to carry out the widening of North End Road by Beaufort House, the Vestry appointed a deputation consisting of Messrs. Lacey, Harrison, Sayer, Knight and C. King, to wait upon the London County Council and request them to contribute two-thirds of the cost as a local improvement. The deputation waited on the Council, and Mr. Harrison fully set before them the views of the Vestry thereon, when it was suggested that an amended application should be made by the Vestry on a larger scheme, and the Vestry, on hearing the result of the interview, instructed the Surveyor to prepare a scheme on the lines of the Council's suggestion, and appointed a Sub-Committee to confer with him in regard to the preparation of the scheme. The London County Council having written stating they had resolved to contribute one half of the net cost of widening between Nos. 197 to 203, such contribution not to exceed £526 10s, the Vestry resolved to accept such offer, and the Surveyor was instructed to interview the persons interested in Nos. 197, 199 and 201, and report whether they were willing to sell the land required to effect the improvement, and, if so, on what terms. On the 11th March, 1896, the Works Committee reported to the Vestry that they were of opinion that the widening of North End Road by Nos. 197, 199 and 201 and Beaufort House could be carried out in accordance with the plan prepared by the Surveyor for the sum of £1,100, and advised that the Law and Parliamentary Committee be recommended to instruct the Solicitor and Surveyor to take the necessary steps to carry out the improvement at a cost not exceeding £1,100, of which nearly one-half, viz.:—£526 ios. has been promised by the London County Council. This recommendation was carried by the Vestry, and on the 25th March, the matter was referred to the Solicitor to report as to the legal aspect of the case, and to the Surveyor to submit a plan shewing a proposed new line of frontage. Orders, Street Nomenclature. Orders were received from the London County Council for the renaming Streets, and renumbering houses in the following:— Bishop's Road, portion of Road connecting S.E. end of Mornington Avenue with North End Road Crown Street Passage between North End Road and May Street Renumbered. Named Conan Street. Renamed Novello Street. Named Kelway Place. 30 Town Hall. During the year ended 25th March, 1896, the Town Halls have been let as follows:— Quarter. Occasions hired.

During the past winter a special course of Technics Education Lectures (similar to those given the previou winter) was given by Professor Vivian Lewes, in the Larg Hall, the lectures being highly appreciated and the attendance everything that could be desired. Licenses for. As usual the Clerk to the Vestry—as Responsible Manager for the Town Hall—attended in October, 1895 before the Licensing Committee of the London County Council at Clerkenwell, and subsequently before the full Council at Spring Gardens, in support of the application for licenses for music, dancing am stage plays, when those for music and dancing only were granted, but he has had no difficulty in being able to get "occasional" stage play licenses when ever they have been required. Vaccination Station at. The Fulham Board of Guardians, having applied to the Vestry for the use of a room in the Town Hall once a week, for a vaccination station, the Vestry resolved to accede to the request of the Guardians and to allow them the use of the Committee room at a yearly rental of £30, which terms the Guardians accepted, as from the 29th September, 1895, and the weekly vaccinatior of children has been performed at the Town Hall since that date. Underground Convenience by St. John's Church. Construction and Cost of. On the 10th April, 1895, the Works Committee reported to the Vestry that they had considered the three schemes prepared by the Surveyor for providing the above, and recommended that plan "A," providing Conveniences for both sexes at an estimated cost of £1,450, be adopted. This recommendation was carried, as also was one that the work be carried out by the Vestry's workmen. The 31 Financial aspect. Attendants. Regulations, &c. Surveyor commenced the work on the 6th May, 1895, and the Convenience was completed and opened on the 18th November, 1895. During the quarter ended 25th March, 1896, the receipts have amounted to £43 19s., whilst the working expenses alone have amounted to £97 18s. 2d. Four attendants (2 male and 2 female) have been appointed, the men at £1 5s. per week each, and the women at £1 per week each. Rules and regulations for the guidance of these attendants have also been adopted by the Vestry. Putney Bridge. Wharf. During the year the Vestry, being in want of additional wharfage accommodation, accepted the offer of the freeholders of the Swan Wharf, Putney Bridge (adjoining the Vestry's own wharf) to take same on a lease for seven years, at £130 per annum rent, with power to the Vestry to break it at the end of three years on notice. Townmead Road. The Surveyor having prepared a plan and detailed report as to embanking a portion of the Wharf site in Townmead Road, the Clerk was instructed to make formal application to the Thames Conservancy for the necessary permission to embank and to construct a barge bed. On the 30th October, 1895, a notice was read from the Thames Conservators stating that upon payment of a fee of £6 6s. to the Assessor, and a fine of £50, payable to the Conservators, the Vestry could at once proceed with the construction of their embankment wall, and the Vestry accordingly ordered cheques to be drawn for those amounts, which was done, and on the 13th November the Clerk received the license, in duplicate, for the embanking of the Wharf. Advertisements have been issued inviting tenders for carrying out the work, and these were received on 29th January, 1896, when that of Messrs. Wimpey & Co., of Hammersmith, was accepted in the sum of ,£3,034. The work is now progressing and will be completed before the end of the summer. Conclusion. Appended to this report will be found the balance sheets, etc., of the various Charities of the Parish, of the Churchwardens and Overseers as regards precepts, and the Burial Board, all of which have been ordered by the Vestry to be printed with this report; and, in conclusion, I herewith tender my best thanks to the staff in my department for the ready and able assistance they have rendered me during the year.

Arthur Robinson, Vestry Clerk. We have this day examined the Receipts and Vouchers in connection with the Overseers' Accounts for the year ended 25th March, 1896, and find the same to be correct. We have ascertained, upon verification of the Accounts with the Pass Books, that the Overseers have a balance in hand of £461 6s. 8d., and we have great pleasure in testifying to the excellent manner in which the Accounts have been kept and presented to us by the Vestry Clerk. We also desire to acknowledge the services rendered by the Overseers' staff on this occasion. Having regard to the very rapid increase in the number of assessments in the Parish of Fulham, we are of opinion that the collection of the Metropolis Management Rates has been carried out in a very expeditious and satisfactory manner. 35 in the Parish or Fulham in the County or Lonaon, 01 which the following Persons are the Trustees, viz,, Vicar and Churchwardens, J.

July 20th, 1896. To the Chairman a/id Members of the Fulham Vestrv. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to report that during the year ended on March 31st, 1896, one hundred and fifty-seven samples of food were submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts. Of these samples thirty-two were procured by Mr. Inspector A. A. Croucher; twenty-seven by Mr. Inspector VV. H. Grigg; thirty-three by Mr. Inspector Chesterfield; and sixty-five by Mr. Inspector C. B. Jones. Also I received from the Surveyor to the Vestry, Mr. C. Botterill, two samples of creosote oil and one sample of asphalte (dates of receipt, October 26th, 1895, March 19th, 1896, and October 30th, 1895, respectively). Thus the entire number of samples analysed was one hundred and sixty. By the census of 1891, the population of Fulham was found to be 91,640, and the samples subjected to analysis, in compliance with the requirements of the Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts, were equivalent in the aggregate to one sample for every 583 individuals. The articles submitted to investigation included one hundred and four samples of milk, seventeen samples of butter, nine samples of coffee, four samples of cocoa, six samples of Demerara sugar, four samples of pepper, four samples of mustard, three samples of vinegar, and six samples of whisky. Stated below (Table I.) are particulars of the numbers of samples of the several articles analysed during each quarter of the year:— TABLE I. Articles Analysed. During First Quarter.

Suggested articles for purchase.— As on previous occasions, I take advantage of this opportunity to name various articles of food and drugs, of many of which no samples have been submitted to me, as Analyst to the Vestry, while of others included in the list, samples have not been brought to me for a considerable period :— Articles of Food. Bread Cheese Lard Flour Ground Rice Oatmeal Arrowroot Pea Flour Corn Flour Baking Powder Yeast Confectionery Jams Tinned Meats and Fish ,, Vegetables „ Fruits Bottled „ Drugs. Quinine Wine of Quinine Tincture of Quinine Citrate of Iron and Quinine Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine Antimonial Wine Wine of Ipecacuanha Sal Volatile Rectified Spirit Precipitated Sulphur Spirit of Nitrous Ether Cream of Tartar Syrup of Squill ,, Poppies ,, Senna Paregoric Rhubarb 48 Articles of Food (continued) Sausages Meat Extracts Pickles and Sauces Ground Ginger Carraways Allspice Cinnamon Cassia Mace and Nutmegs Candied Peel Olive Oil Aerated Waters British and other Wines Beer Rum, Gin and Brandy Drugs (continued). Saffron Mercury with Chalk Solution of Perchloride of Iror Jalap Glycerine Fluid Magnesia Fowler's Solution Compound Liquorice Powder Liquorice Acetic Acid Castor Oil Coca Wine Another article, which might possibly receive attention, is beeswax, adulteration of which, with paraffin wax, on an extensive scale, is especial referred to in the recently-issued report from the Select Committee on For Products Adulteration. Milk and Butter.—On reference to Tables I. and II., it will be s??? that more samples of milk were obtained for analysis than of all the rest, the articles together, and that of the (04 samples of milk analysed, twe??? only were returned as adulterated; that is to say, 11*5 per cent, of 1 number. When it is recalled that the corresponding percentages for 1893-1 and 1894-95, were 217 and 297, a great and important improvemt becomes manifest. Nevertheless, though the proportion of adulterat samples diminished so materially in the year to which this report refers, to nature and extent of the sophistications observed, cannot but be regarded very serious. Seven of the twelve adulterated samples had been deprived fat, the percentages indicating the amount of adulteration ranging from to as much as 95. The remaining five samples had been mixed with water, the lowest proportion of the adulterant being 13 per cent., and the highest, 23 parts. Apart from the twelve samples of milk here particularise there were ten instances in which the milk was found to be of "poor" "inferior" quality; but as calculations must be based on very low limit none of these could be certified as adulterated. It should be mentioned the at least one sample of milk was found to be of unusually good quality Comparatively few samples of butter were submitted for analysis; sevented in all, or nearly the same number as in the previous year; these we returned as of normal quality. Coffee.—Nine samples of coffee were received during the year, and two of these were adulterated with chicory—the quantities of the extraneou substance being 14 and 68 parts, respectively. The number of samples coffee having been so limited, it is not easy to form an opinion whether the admixture of chicory is carried on in Fulham as extensively as in past years but it is noteworthy that of the five samples submitted to me in 1894-95, no one was adulterated, while in 1895-96, two out of the nine samples containe chicory. There would not seem to be much improvement here. 49 Cocoa.— Ihree of the four cocoas examined were mixed with starch and sugar, in the proportions of 33, 35, and 39 parts, respectively. Demerara Sugar, etc.—The remaining samples submitted to analysis luring the year, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act Demerara sugar, pepper, mustard, vinegar and whisky), were found to be of iverage quality and purity. Additional Samples.—The two samples of creosote oil, and the specimen of asphalte, received from the Surveyor to the Vestry, were of satisfactory quality and reported on accordingly. Nature and number of samples taken—From Tables I. and II. it will be gathered that the samples purchased for analysis during 1895-96 represented a very limited number of articles of food ; and of these in some cases very few samples were obtained. No sample of any drug was procured during the year. Fines.—As in past years, the fines imposed in the cases of adulteration vere mostly insignificant in amount, ranging from seven-and-sixpence to two Dounds, with costs; one penalty of three pounds and two of five pounds, lowever, were inflicted. On the other hand, in a case of milk adulterated with thirteen per cent, of added water, a fine of sixpence, and costs, would seem distinctly inadequate. Comparative Statistics.—The statistics of the Metropolis, and of the whole of England and Wales, for the years 1890-91-92-93-94, are quoted here from the Annual Reports of the Local Government Board, for the sake of comparison with the figures for Fulham already given in Table II., and it will be observed that the last-named figures compare much more favourably with the rest than was the case in 1894-95. It is apparent that adulteration has been less prevalent in Fulham during 1895-96 than in the preceding year. The following are the statistics referred to:— METROPOLIS. Year. Samples Examined. Samples Adulterated. Proportion Adulterated. 1890 6,847 1,058 15.5 % 1891 7,295 1,163 15.9 % 1892 7,380 1,253 17.0 % 1893 7,989 1,365 17.1 % 1894 8,607 1,220 14.2 % ENGLAND AND WALES. Year. Samples Examined. Samples Adulterated. Proportion Adulterated. 1890 27,465 3,069 11.2 % 1891 29,028 3,540 I2.2 % 1892 32,447 4,009 12.4 % 1893 37,233 4,793 12.9 % 1894 39516 4,060 10.3 % [E] 5° The Private Purchaser.—It appears from the report of the Local Government Board for 1894-95, that of the 39,516 samples submittei??? analysis in 1894, only 174 were obtained by private purchasers, and of the samples no less than 27*6 per cent, were condemned on analysis, as against 10-3 per cent, of the samples obtained by officers of local authorities. fact appears to be that a private individual will only incur the cost on analysis, when there are very strong grounds indeed for suspect adulteration. Report of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Food Products Adult tion.— In May, 1894, a Select Committee was appointed by the House Commons to enquire into the working of the Sale of Food and Drugs Margarine Acts; and the report, which is of considerable length, has published within the past few days, after an investigation extending over years. It will not be inappropriate to bring my Annual Report to conclusion, by quoting some of the many recommendations of what a lead journal has justly styled 44 one of the most important Committees that he ever been appointed by the House of Commons." Inter alia it recommended :— " That, in connection with the sale of mixed articles it should obligatory upon the vendor to supply the purchaser with a label setting for that the article is mixed." "That the statement of admixture on labels should be legibly distinctly printed, and so as not to be obscured by any other print matter 44 That, subject to the limitations indicated in the Report, invoices equivalent documents should have the force of warranties in the case on articles to which the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts apply." 44 That the powers of section 3 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1879, as to the taking of samples of milk in transit, she be extended to other articles." 44 That the maximum penalty for refusal to sell a sample to authorised officer be increased." 44 That samples should be divided into four instead of three parts, that one of these parts should be at the disposal of the wholesale dealer." 44 That any person guilty of a second offence under the Sale of Food; Drugs Acts should be liable to a minimum penalty of^5, and that in rest of the third or subsequent offences under those Acts and the Margarine. A 1887, the punishment of imprisonment without the option of a fine may inflicted at the discretion of the magistrates, or court." 44 That magistrates should be authorised to make orders, at their cretion, requiring a person convicted of offences under the Acts to publie notification of his conviction in the public press of the locality where offence occurred," 51 "That the definition of the word 'food' as used in the. Acts should be mended so as to include expressly all articles intended to enter into or be sed in the preparation or flavouring of food." "That an authority should be constituted who should act as a Court of leference upon scientific and other questions arising under the Acts, and ho should be empowered, at their discretion, to prescribe standards and mits of the quality and purity of food."

Under 23 and 24 Victoria, c. 51, and 40 and 41 Victoria, c. 66, and sub-section 7 of section I. of London (Equalization of Rates) Act, 1894, it is enacted that every Vestry, District Board, etc., shall make a return annually of the sums levied or received by or in interest of rates, taxes, etc., and of the expenditure thereof, to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State. Under the above Acts, the Statistical Department of the Local Government Board issue, during the month of July in each year, a form embracing the various heads of receipts and expenditure, and of loans, etc., employed by local authorities. In July, 1895, forms (in duplicate) for the Local Taxation Returns were received by this Vestry, and referred to me to fill up. This was duly done, and on my presenting same to the Finance Committee, they instructed the Clerk to return the form to the Local Government Board. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. At various periods the London County Council have applied to the Fulham Vestry for particulars with respect to its receipts and expenditure on Rates and Loans. This information 1 have always supplied them with, by instructions of the Finance Committee. The result of their enquiries from the whole of the County of London, the Council have caused to be printed, and have circulated returns showing:— I. Returns of Loans outstanding in the County of London at March, 1895. II. Return showing annual charges in respect of Loans for 1893-94, and 1894-5. Return I.—This return embraces the whole debt of London for Local Government purposes (excluding the City Corporation), and by it is shown the entire indebtedness of each parish for not only the loans contracted by the local authorities, but also for the proportion of the Central and County Authorities' loans. With regard to the Parish of Fulham, this return tends to show that it is in the unenviable position of being the fifth highest, in point of total indebtedness, in London. The percentage of indebtedness on the rateable value of £484,851 being: for local purposes 31.41, and for both county and local purposes 119.89. This will not hold good for more than the year mentioned, as will be seen by last year's report when the percentages were 31.13 and 116.11 respectively. 62 The figures extracted from the return are as follows:— £ s. d. Proportion of Union Loans, Poor Law Purposes 49,081 0 0 Vestry Loans, Local Management 94,290 0 0 Burial Board 2,917 0 0 Library Commissioners 3,683 0 0 School District Managers 2304 0 0 Total Local Loans £152,275 0 0 £ s. d.

(Charges on Loans) the return is very useful, showing clearly to the ratepayers of each District in the Metropolis their proportion of the annual cost (divided between the various spending authorities) of the enormous loan burden of London, which in the case of the County Loans fall equally on all Parishes according to their rateable value.

At a meeting of the Cartage Committee, in July, 1895, the question arose as to the cost of hired horses, and as to whether it would not be more economical for the Vestry to own the horses employed on its works. A report was ordered to be prepared by the Surveyor and myself, shewing the loss or saving on both methods; we accordingly prepared and presented the following report :— " To the Chairman and Members of the Cartage Committee. Hired Horses v. Vestry Horses. " Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen,—The tabulated statement attached shews that the average cost of maintaining the Vestry's horses is practically the same as shewn in previous reports (see page 228 of the eighth annual 63 report). It will be noticed that, hiring horses at the present prices, the Vestry would effect a saving (say) of £15 per horse per annum, and this without any risk of liability for damage done by collisions, &c. "To erect new stabling a new site must be used. As there is no space for enlargement at Munster Road, this would necessitate the employment of a number of men as permanent staff, and taking into consideration that the minimum number of horses hired per day is only 12, which would be as many horses as the Vestry would be justified in economically owning, the cost of maintenance per horse would be much higher than at present. "Therefore, the conclusion to be arrived at is that, under existing circumstances it would be advisable to continue under the present arrangements. 'We are, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, C. Botterill, Surveyor to the Vestry. R. H. Meyer, Accountant to the Vestry. REPORT ON HORSES. Particulars. Payments during 1894-5. Total. To Horses. £ s. d. £ s. d.

At the following meeting of the Vestry some of the members asked for a further report with more details, and I was accordingly instructed to prepare a tabular statement, shewing a series of half-years, for comparison. On presenting the following report, the Vestry approved of same and the matter was allowed to be dropped.

NOTE.—The variation in the amount saved on hired horses is principally brought about by the different prices in the Fodder Contracts each half-year, while the hiring charge has remained practically the same for the period covered. EQUALISATION OF RATES ACT, 1894. This Act, which came into operation on the 30th September, 1894, has en of great benefit to Fulham Parish. The provisions of the Act are shortly as follows: I.—An Equalisation Fund to be formed by the London County Council, equal to a rate of 6d. in the £ per annum, upon the rateable value of the various Parishes in the Metropolis. II.—The fund is to be distributed half-yearly among the Sanitary Districts in proportion to their population as estimated by the Registrar-General, or by census. III.—The sums so distributed are to be applied in defraying— (firstly) the expenses of the Sanitary Authority incurred under the Public Health (London) Act; (secondly) those incurred in respect of Public Lighting; and the balance (if any), to those incurred in respect of Streets. The total amount of the Fund for the Year 1895-96 was ,£855,638 5s. 6d., and Fulham is has contributed thereto and received therefrom as follows:— Half Year to 25th Sent., 1895. Half Year to 25th March, 1896. £ s. d. £ s. d. Grant from Fund, equals 1/1¾ (about) per head on an estimated population of 108,049 10,695 15 2 10,695 15 2 Contribution to, equals 3d. in the £ on Rateable Value of £511,738 6,396 14 6 6,396 14 6 Difference in favor of Parish £4.299 0 8 £4.299 0 8 The above sums, together with a small amount of £17 14s. 6d. (due to this Parish on previous year's return and brought about by an error in the return of the Parish of nberwell), making a total of ,£8,615 158. 10d, have been received and credited to the eral Rates of the Parish, thereby reducing the amount called for by the Vestry from Ratepayers by more than a sum of 4¼d. in the £. NEW STREETS. With reference to the New Streets Accounts, during the past year there been received the sum of £9377 9s. 6d. on account of apportionments de. The amounts still due by contributors are—on old roads, transferred his Vestry by the late District Board of Works, the sum of ,£124 3s. 7d., on the streets taken to by this Vestry during the past ten years sum of £5,642 15s. 5d., making the total due on new streets to be .766 19s. od. 66 Since the incorporation of the Vestry of Fulham in March, 1886, there have been sealed 298 original apportionments for “new streets,” paving and sewering works, amounting to £161,880 18s. 5d.; of this number the magistrates have declared eighteen bad and irrecoverable through sundry causes, and the apportionments thereon, amounting to £6,884 15s. 5d., have been rescinded, and where money had been paid by contributors it was refunded in full; of this number nine have been re-apportioned and works proceeded with. Of the 298 good apportionments, the works have been completed in 264 cases, with the result that the estimate was exceeded in 53 cases, necessitating the sealing of additional apportionments to the amount of £3,164 10s. 7d., while in 195 cases the estimate was more than sufficient and allowed a return to be made to the owners of ,£19,153 os. 7d., and in the remaining 16 cases the estimate just covered the actual cost of the works To show the magnitude of the new streets work, and that the property of the Fulham Parish is not held by a few individuals, I may mention that the details of the numerous apportionments, etc., necessitated the opening of upwards of 5,000 ledger accounts, entailing a large amount of clerica labour. WORKS DEPARTMENT. The Vestry for some time past has been desirous of executing more of it: own work without the intervention of a contractor, and during the yea 11595-6 have passed resolutions instructing its Surveyor to carry out with hi: staff the construction of the underground convenience at Walham Green by St. John's Church, also painting and other works at Public Mortuary, erecting a band stand and refreshment house at Bishop's Park, &c. In the case of the underground convenience, the accounts show saving over the estimate. The abstract of the cost is as follows:— Receiptss. £ s. d. Payments. £ s. d Loan 1,400 0 0 Wages 411 14 10 Materials— Cartage 39 6 0 Sand, Ballast, &c. 23 3 0 Plant and Stores, Timber and Materials from Depot 58 0 10 Old Paving Blocks 14 5 0 Timber (returned) 44 0 9 Accounts paid for Materials Supplied, Work Executed, &c. 939 0 1 Plant and Stores (do.) 15 0 7 Connection to Sewer and Construction of Tidal Valve 40 1 Sundries and Incidentals 8 5 £1,496 9 4 £l,496 9 The painting, &c., work at Public Mortuary and the erection of refreshment house were not complete at Lady Day, while with regard to the band stand the cost (about £315) was very much in excess of the estimate principally through alterations made to plans to comply with the London County Council's requirements. 67 LABOUR, &c.—WAGES ACCOUNT. The Parishioners will form some idea of the rapid devolopement of the Parish by the comparative statement of the Labour Wages Accounts for 886 and that of 1895. On the 27th day of January, 1886, the Vestry passed the following esolution, on the recommendation of the Works Committee:— “That in order to efficiently carry out the works required in the making, maintaining, and cleansing of the streets and sewers in the Parish, a staff of Artisans and Labourers be employed as follows:— 30 Scavengers, 4 Spreaders and 1 Ganger 12 Ground and Sewermen and 1 Ganger 1 Bricklayer and 1 Labourer 1 Mason and 1 Labourer Average weekly wages, 6 Flushers and Gulleymen £76 0 0 1 Storekeeper and 1 Watchman 1 Steam Roller Driver Pecking Gang (about 4 men) when required At the same time the Stable Department staff was as follows:— 15 Dustmen (10 with horses) 9 Carmen with horses Average weekly wages, 1 Horsekeeper and 1 Stableman £32 0 0 1 Yardman The following shows the approximate number of men constantly employed, and cost, in 1895-96:— Works Department:— 70 Scavengers and 2 Foremen 40 Spreaders, Flushers, Ground and Sewermen 2 Gangers to ditto 3 Men at Dust and Slop Shoots 5 Masons and 5 Labourers 1 Bricklayer and 1 Labourer Average weekly wages, 2 Wood Paviors £2200 0 1 Asphalter and 1 Labourer 1 Steam Crane Driver and 1 Roller Driver 3 Followers (sweepers) 5 Watchmen and 2 Depotmen 2 Store Clerks and 1 Wharf Keeper Barge and Pecking Gangs as required 68 Cartage Department:— 32 Dustmen (24 with horses) 24 Carmen (with horses) Average weekly wag 1 Stableman, 1 Watchman £ 110 0 0 2 Horsekeepers, 1 Painter 3 Wheelwrights, 1 Carpenter 4 Farriers, Smiths, &c.

MEYER, Accountant to the Vest 95 The Vestry of the Parish of fulham. Town Hall Walham Green, S.W. AUDITORS' CERTIFICATE. We, the undersigned, Auditors of the Accounts of jQ s. d. the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, hereby certify that we have examined the books of the Vestry for the financial year ending 25th March, 1896, and have compared the vouchers with the cheques, and we find the balance of 18790 14 6 at the bankers on current accounts to be correct, and allowing for the outstanding cheques amounting to 1847 19 o :he balance to be ,£16942 15 6 We have also examined the Loan Account of the Vestry, and we find that the loans, including .£21,275 ???rrowed during the year, amount to £102724 2 o We note that .£5,766 19s. is due from contributors on new streets, as against £8,973 17s. 11d. of the previous year, of which £1,131 14s. 7d. is due on the streets completed, and that the contributors who have not paid anything for 2 to 4 years amount to .£382 9s. 10d. We consider further efforts ought to be made upon the owners of the properties for the further eduction of these outstanding amounts. We note that the Solicitor to the Vestry has received the .sum of £713 10s. 1d. for out of pocket expenses and professional services rendered luring the year. We should suggest on behalf of the ratepayers that his ???ills of costs be taxed in the usual way We have caused a circular letter to be written to the Clerks of the whole of the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, and from 31 replies we find hat 28 Vestries audit their accounts by the "Elected Auditors" only, and 3 only have "Chartered Accountants," and one of these is employed to assist he publicly elected Auditors ; but as far as we have ascertained not any of 96 the London Vestries have a bye-law sanctioned by the Local Government Board or any authority giving them power to employ Chartered Accounta??? to do what was already provided for by the "Elected Auditors,'' and sor??? of the Clerks to the Vestries inform us they know of no legal authority incur that expense. We protest against the sum of £36 15s. being yearly paid to a firm Chartered Accountants to audit the Vestry's accounts (see Bye-law 51, Sec. I We have examined your Accountant and Assistant, and other officers of tl??? Vestry under the powers vested in us, the "Elected Auditors" of the Paris of Fulham, and we find they have rendered them no assistance whateve??? and we consider their appointment and payment not only illegal and contract to the Metropolitan Management Act, 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 120, Sec. 20 1855, and confirmed under Sec. 31 of the Local Government Act, 1894, an consequently we consider the Vestry had no power to make Bye-law 5 confirmed by the Vestry 6th December, 1893, all penalties of same n??? binding, as the said bye-laws are not authorised or approved by the Local Government Board or one of Her Majesty's Secretaries of State. We are fully aware of the fact that the Vestry may smile at what consider we have a right to protest against. We have very great pleasure in certifying that the accounts have bee kept in a very clear and concise mariner, and does great credit to Mr. Meyei??? the Accountant, and we have to thank Mr. Denselow and other officials c the Vestry for the kind way they have assisted us during the audit.

TENTH Annual Report Being for the Year 1895-96, OF THE SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY, WITH LISTS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STREETS, IMPROVEMENTS, CONTRACTS, INVENTORY OF PLANT, ETC., ETC. CHARLES BOTTERILL, Member of Incorporated Association of Engineers, Surveyor to the Vestry of Fulham. [ Q ] The Vestry of the Parish of fulham. REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR, FOR THE YEAR 1895.96. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present the Tenth Annual Report of Works carried out in this Parish during the year from the 25th March, 1895, to the 25th March, 1896, with Schedules showing various details at the end. It will be seen that the works and expenses increase as the Parish becomes more densely populated, and consequently the work of the Surveyor's department increasts proportionately. Various improvements have been effected, or are under consideration, and the maintenance of permanent works, such as roads, sewers, &c., has had close, careful and efficient attention. AREA OF THE PARISH. The area of the Parish of Fulham is 1,700 324 acres. Area of Foreshore 56.561 „ Area of Tidal Water 99.614 „ Total 1,856.499 COMPARATIVE TABLE. Showing the increase in the population, length of roads, footpaths, etc., of the Parish since the separation from Hammersmith in 1886. The population at the previous census in 1881 was 42,895. It will be seen that there has been a very large increase since 1891, in all respects.

Schedule IV. represents the whole area of roads paved with wood, out of which it will be seen 6,161 superficial yards have been laid during the current year. The re-laying of Lillie Road is now in hand, and that of King's Road, from Stanley Bridge to Waterford Road, is to follow. The re-laying of North End Road, from Star Road to the "Cedars" Public House, is badly needed, but on account of the new sewer which is being laid by the L.C.C., cannot be done as the traffic could not be diverted. The plain deal blocks as first laid in the three above-named roads cannot be said to have been satisfactory, for after a time the wood becomes desiccated and saturated with water, &c., and in many cases affected by dry rot. With regard to creosoted deal this does not occur, as the process of abstracting the moisture from the blocks and forcing in, by pressure, of 10 lbs. of creosote to every cubic foot of timber prevents the evils mentioned, and in addition acts as an excellent deodorizer and disinfectant. These pavements, in the hot weather, are watered with the Vans, which have in each load of water a small quantity of miscible creosote, which acts additionally as a disinfectant and deodorizer. 208 SEWERS LAID BY PRIVATE PERSONS IN 1895-96.

(Shewn on page 209.) The estimate which was made by my predecessor, Mr. Norrington???s founded on the actual cost to the Vestry of Munster Road and Fulham P???e Road Sewers which were let out to Contractors and are both of very si???r nature as regards depth, nature of sub-soil, quantity of sub-soil water structural features. The Vestry were at a disadvantage with regard to the possessic???f adequate plant, and the money expended in hire of plant is, of course, la???v a loss, and the Vestry, in my opinion, certainly did not get so much valu???r the wages expended as a private individual would have done. As to the???chase of materials there can be no question that the Vestry is placed i???1 extremely favourable position, and can and does buy these as well an???; cheaply as any Contractor. I may say, that in the course of the sewer contracts previously r??? tioned, that the Vestry were paid for or took away the sand and ballast w??? was surplus material, and that the value of this, in the case of Wandswarth Bridge Road Sewer, would not have been credited to the Contractor. The estimated cost of this work was, as stated above, ,£3,841 and ac??? cost .£5,233, and I feel confident it might have been carried out by a g??? firm of Contractors for the estimated amount This is a class of work wl??? cannot well be done by a public authority, at any rate economically. DISTILLERY LANE SEWER. This sewer caused a considerable amount of trouble this year, reason on examination being found to be an obstruction in the shape o??? large piece of timber which by some means had lodged in the sewer, kinds of false rumours were circulated as to this, and an owner of propt made a claim on the Vestry for compensation. However, no further st??? were taken. I only mention this to the Vestry as any amount of abuse v??? lavished upon me without cause, and before the facts could be ascertair??? by those who ought to have waited for them. This sewer, formerly kno??? as the Black Bull Ditch, is on the boundary of the Parish, and half ??? expense of maintenance and repair is borne by the Hammersmith Vestry, a??? as usual, the half cost of this stoppage was paid by them on application. SURCHARGING OF SEWERS. Surcharging of the sewers of the district took place on a few occasio during the stormy weather, causing great inconvenience to the inhabitan In consequence of many complaints, the London County Council appli??? to me for detailed information as to the floodings, and a very full accou??? was sent to them. The Council have passed a scheme, prepared by th??? Chief Engineer, to give relief in the shape of a Pumping Station to beerect??? on the bank of the Thames at the end of Imperial Road, but operations ha??? not yet commenced. In several instances where the basements of houses a??? exceptionally deep, on my recommendation, tidal flap valves have bet??? 211 ???rted between the house and sewer with excellent effect, but the expense of ???se is too great to be adopted for small properties. One has been fixed in ???moth Place for the drain of the Underground Convenience, and has ???ved quite effectual, although the floor of this building is well below flood ???el. VENTILATING SHAFTS. During the year 15 ventilating shafts have been erected (see page 258). This makes a total of 57 ventilating shafts erected to ventilate existing ???ers since March, 1886. The benefits received from these appears to be doubted, and the subject of ventilating the Sewers generally is receiving ???e attention. HOUSE DRAINAGE. The proper construction of the drainage of houses has continued to ???upy the attention of the Vestry, but the number of plans submitted shows ???ight decrease on the preceding year.

COMBINED DRAINAGE. In consequence of the decisions of the Courts as to combined drainage ???g, under certain circumstances, sewerage, and maintainable by the ???ry, several cases have been dealt with by relaying, at the Vestry's ???nse. Of course, the most serious phase of this matter is the question of ???anent maintenance which must be taken as a liability and duty of the ???ry, but when one considers the difficulties experienced in prosecuting ???thorised persons interfering or tampering with sewers in public streets ???ways, how much more difficult must it be to exercise due surveillance ???those which are in the enclosure of private premises. 212 STREET LIGHTING AND BISHOP'S PARK.

On the closing of the footpath along the moat, from the main entrance ???Fulham Palace to All Saints' Church, the whole of the lamps on the ???nclosed portion of the Bishop's Park were disconnected from the street Lighting, and are now all supplied through one meter. The closing of the footpath has increased the number of lamps chargeable to the Park from ???ineteen to thirty-four. In comparing the maintenance by the Vestry with the maintenance by Contractors the two items— Knockdowns £ 14 4 10 Mason 8 13 5 £22 18 3 ???hould be deducted, which leaves approximately— £16o 0 0 for wages. 10 0.0 „ tools. 120 0 0 ,, materials. Total, excluding painting, £290 0 0 This compares favourably with £330 to £350, the amount pro rata payable ???o a Contractor for the past years' maintenance. In painting the lamps, the Contractors were always very unsatisfactory, ???he work being done piecework, and being commenced late in the year ???hen good weather was not to be expected. As it was not possible to commence the painting with the Vestry's workmen early in the past year, it was left to stand over, and commenced in the beginning of April, 1896, and ???s now complete at a cost of £123 11 6 for wages. 43 16 11 „ materials. Total, £167 8 5 As the painting has now been thoroughly done with good material, here is no doubt it will last for two years at least. 214 INCANDESCENT GAS STREET LIGHTING. A resolution was carried on the 25th March, 1896, to light the Fulham Road from Stamford Bridge to the Fire Station by incandescent gas l???ts as an experiment, but no limit was placed as to time. The result of???is experiment has to be arrived at, but it is to be hoped it may prove succe???l. The lighting of the Town Hall with these, has undoubtedly bee???n improvement on the ordinary gas lighting. IMPROVEMENTS. In Schedule X. is shown the various improvements where land is g???n up to widen the roads under compulsory powers or otherwise, and in Sche???e XI. the numerous lesser works which have been ordered by the Vestry. IMPROVEMENT, MUNSTER ROAD, BY BOARD SCHOOL The agreement to carry out this most necessary improvement has??? entered into between the School Board and the Vestry, and the work of set??? back is shortly to be done. This involves building a new boundary wall taking down out-buildings and re-erecting them in altered position and wi??? a very expensive matter, the whole of which expenses might have??? avoided, except the pro rata cost of land, if the two authorities had met??? other in a proper spirit. IMPROVEMENT, NORTH END ROAD, BY FANE STREET The forecourts of Nos. 182, 184 and 186 have been purchased and setting back and necessary works of cellarage, &c., carried out, providin??? very much needed extension in the width of the footway at this part of road. The improvement has been in hand for many years, and the provisi??? of Michael Angelo Taylor's Act have had to be enforced before the whole these forecourts were obtained. In the case of No. 182 an offer of £60??? made as compensation to the owner for severance, and the Court awar??? jQ 24 with costs against the claimant. So that in these cases it would app??? that the Vestries are protected against undue claims for compensation w??? they themselves offer reasonable amounts. IMPROVEMENT, BURLINGTON ROAD. The widening cf this road in front of Nos. 61 to 71 has been effected,??? land given up being 54 sup. yards in extent, without charge, on condition??? the Vestry re-building the forecourt walls and paving the footway, &c. T??? works have been done at a cost of ^143 and the road at this point is widen??? from 17 to 22 feet. IMPROVEMENT, MARGRAVINE ROAD BY "PEAR TREE" PUBLIC HOUSE, A triangular projecting piece of land has been thrown into the carriag??? way, making a desirable improvement. The area of lane acquired is??? sup. yards, the work of setting back, paving, &c., was done at the cost of t??? Vestry in addition to the sum of money paid as compensation for the land. 215 IMPROVEMENT, FULHAM PALACE ROAD, OPPOSITE Nos. 79 & 81. These frontages have been set back, the paving and roadway widened, proving this part of Fulham Palace Road. The land acquired is 35 ???. yards, and the cost of this together with the works have been borne by Vestry. IMPROVEMENT, DAWES ROAD, BY VARNA ROAD. A very good improvement has been carried out here, the footway viously being positively dangerous on account of its narrowness, and the ???e amount of traffic passing by it. The land acquired is 73 sup. yards, ???the cost of this and the works have been borne by the Vestry. BISHOP'S PARK. During the year a Band Stand has been erected, with canopy carried by amental cast iron columns and brackets, and covered by red Broseley ???s. The band using this are highly satisfied and the public appreciate the ???erence, as last year the band had to play standing on the ground and con???uently at a great disadvantage. A Refreshment Stall has also been erected, built by our own workmen, ???has been let to a refreshment contractor at a rent of ^15 per annum, ???ch will pay good interest on the outlay. It is an undoubted boon to the ???lic. The tariff is practically that adopted in the open spaces of the London ???inty Council, and is of a very moderate character. The grounds generally ???e been kept in a creditable way and the show of simple flowers has been ???t satisfactory. It will be necessary this year to paint all the iron fencing as this has not ???n done since the opening of the Park. The West Meadow is still closed ???he public, and it would be inadvisable to open it until the growth of the ???ss has become fully established. Sea shell should be used again on the ???vel walks, as mentioned in my last Report EXTENSION OF BISHOP'S PARK. The scheme for building the river wall from the Bishop's Park to Putney ???dge, facing Pryor's Bank, has been approved by the London County Council, and the work is now in the Contractor's hands, a contract having ???n entered into with Messrs. G. Wimpey & Co. for .£2,551, my estimate ???this being .£2,900. The work is of some difficulty as the line of the new ???l is studded with old piles and sheeting, also by reason of the confined ???ce on the bank for working operations. Previous to the contract being ???a timber flood bank was erected by the Vestry's workmen along the whole ???gth to a height of 18 50 above ordnance datum, so as to comply with the ???ames Flood Protection Act, and was necessary because the normal level ???he garden ground at Pryor's Bank is tome feet below that level. ???flight of steps, designed by the writer to form an access from Putney ???ge, has also been approved and adopted by the Vestry and the London County Council to be built at an estimated cost of ;£i,35°- These cannot be ???menced until the works of the embankment wall are pretty well completed, the site for them is required for the workshops of the new wall contractors. 2l6 The laying out of the grounds will not be a matter of great magnitude ,???he proposal is to retain as much as possible the walks, shrubberies, &c., in their old form. RECREATION GROUND, LILLIE ROAD. This ground cannot be said to be as satisfactorily kept as that of Bi???p's Park, but if the Vestry does not support their chief officer in his effo???by giving him proper and adequate attendants the result must be as it is???ol house and workman's w.c. has been erected in the south-west corner???the boys' play ground ; also, box edging has been placed around the wh???of the borders facing Lillie and Fulham Palace Roads, to keep the soil d???ng storm times from being washed on to the public footways. A reques???as made by and granted for a firm of builders to have the public urinal n???ed to another site on the grounds, but the negotiations fell through. On account of the numerous accidents caused by the abuse of the sv???s, on my recommendation these were not fixed this year. This is an ins???re of the decent children having to lose a reasonable pleasure throug???ne want of a capable attendant, as the accidents occurred from my information simply for want of control over the rougher elements. Several applications for leave to play cricket on the central space have had to be refused, f???oe area is so confined that the danger would be too great for the general public and children to risk. VESTRY WHARF, TOWN MEAD ROAD. A wharf wall and barge bed to the writer's design have been let by??? tract to Messrs. G Wimpey & Co. for ,£3,034, the estimated cost l???g £3,800. The work is in hand and should be completed in five months???m the 9th March. The foreshore reclaimed is somewhat in excess of the???rt shown on the deed of purchase, as it was considered the old line of fore:???e must have extended further. Application was therefore made to the Th???s Conservators for an extended line, and although the Vestry's full request???is not acceded to it was in part, and the extra land reclaimed is accept???e. There will be a depth of 16ft. 6in. from the coping of wall to barge bed???d barges will be able to load and unload at neap tides. The wall is form???f concrete with blue Staffordshire brick facing and the necessary fender???s and anchor ties. The section and details of this work having been appered by the London County Council and the Thames Conservators. SWAN WHARF. It was found, through loss of shoots, necssary at the end of Decer??? to provide for barging away slop and road sweepings, and as the Toll H???e Wharf was totally inadequate, the adjoining wharf, named Swan Wharf, ha??? a frontage of 94 feet, was hired at a rental of £130 for 3 years, with??? option of extending the time for seven years. This has proved satisfact??? and in the future will undoubtedly be quite as much needed. ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND DUST DESIRUCTOR. These large questions are under consideration, and a Special Comim??? of the Vestry is appointed for the purposes of investigation and report. Electrical Consulting Engineer has made his report (for an agreed fee), wh??? if adopted and the scheme therein laid down be carried out, his appoint??? 217 will continue until the work is finished. The matter of Electric Lighting this Parish is of such magnitude and the economical, or rather profitable, working of it so doubtful, that the Committee and Vestry act very wisely in hastening slowly, and there can be no doubt that, in reason, too much time cannot be spent in arriving at a proper conclusion. A Dust Destructor is also a work not to be too hastily carried out, for a failure in this would involve a very heavy loss, and there are points to be carefully considered upon which more information is required than is at present in the Vestry's possession. UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCE. An Underground Convenience for both sexes has been constructed near St. John's Church, Walham Green, this being considered the most suitable site next to that opposite the District Railway Station, which would undoubtedly be the best in Fulham, but, unfortunately, it was found to be impracticable, as the Railway tunnel is beneath the road at the required position. The work has been carried out at a cost of £1,400 (estimated cost £1,450), without the intervention of a Contractor. My report very distinctly states that the cost of maintenance would most probably be in excess of the receipts and that has been found to be so. However, the advantages to the public to a very great extent outweigh this loss, and that which was a public nuisance in the neighDourhood in question has been done away with. LINES OF FRONTAGE. New buildings are closely watched to see that no infringements take place of the various lines of frontage, and during the year it has been necessary to draw the attention of the London County Council to three buildings, two of which were allowed Schedule XII. is a full statement of all lines of frontage which have ???arisen during the year. VAULTS, PAVEMENT LIGHTS, &c. In Schedule XIII. are particulars of the various vaults, pavement lights and cellar flaps, for private persons, which have been consented to and carried out during the year. CROSSINGS, &c. In Schedule XIV. are the particulars of the various crossings laid for private persons. APPLICATION FOR ADDITIONAL POWERS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD. Amongst other matters for which the Vestry have asked the Government for extra powers is that of the compulsory acquisition of land under the Land Clauses Act. It may be pointed out that for the purposes of improvements this would probably be a disadvantage, as the powers now in ???ogue under 37 Geo. III., cap. 57, known as Michael |Angelo Taylor's Act, ???re the best to act upon, for the owners of land are precluded from obtaining ???orbitant claims by reason of the question of costs, which in every case ???ust be paid by them as far as their own are concerned and to the authorities ???s well where the award is less than the amount of claim. Knowing this, ???ost owners are amenable to reason and accept fair and reasonable combensation without litigation. [R] 2l8 WORKMEN EMPLOYED AND WAGES PAID.

The Vestry is??? in maintaining this matter of paying the entrance fee for the ho??? the awards being made chiefly on account of the way in which t??? are attended to and the cleanliness of their harness. FROST, SNOW, AND UNEMPLOYED WORKMEN. The winter was most exceptionally mild and consequently no e??? expenses were incurred in the removal and disposal of snow, also??? very light and infrequent frosts involved a great deal less than??? ordinary expenditure for sanding the roads. The open weather also provided work for out-door operatives, so??? I believe the distress in this parish through want of work was much be the normal point. DUST.

The charge made for this is 2s. 6d. per load, but this is, as pointed out before, a dead loss to the Vestry, as the cost of barging alone is 2s. 3d. STREET CLEANSING AND SLOPPING. For this work the following staff and plant are engaged:— 70 Scavengers, 30 Horses, 8 Horse brooms, 8 Horse scrapers, 16 Orderly hand-trucks, 6 Sanding machines, 35 Slop Carts, 20 Shoot carts, 26 Water vans, 2 Water carts. The wood-paved carriageways have had the usual and proper attention, as also the macadamized and (lint roads in the matter of cleansing. A proposal is now before the Cartage Committee to have regular all-night scavenging so as to relieve the day work, and carry out the work with greater expedition and regularity, and there is but little doubt this is a scheme which will be an advantageous one.

The whole of the trees in the streets have been pruned this season ??? the Vestry's own workmen, and with satisfactory results. This is a wo??? every year of a certain magnitude and necessity, for the new wood made??? the trees (which are nearly all plane trees) is surprisingly great, and in road of the widths in which they are planted the obstruction to traffic and light and air compels annual and drastic pruning. In Wandsworth Bridge Road several young trees were destroyed by a run-away horse and van, but these and others which have died, have been re-placed. Schedule VII. is a detailed list of the trees in the Parish streets. 225 LICENSES FOR HOARDINGS, &c.

To the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham, Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics, and the conditions affecting the health of the district for the year 1895. The statistics of Marriages, Births, Deaths and Infectious Diseases relate to the 52 weeks ending December 28th, 1895. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken in April, 1891, was 91,640, having Increased from 42,900 during the preceding ten years. The population in the middle of 1895 as calculated in the usual manner on the assumption that the rates of increase which prevailed between 1881 and 1891 have been maintained since, was 117,773, but there is reason to believe that this is somewhat too high, and calculating from the number of inhabited houses on the rate books, the population in the middle of 1895 may be estimated at 111,150, and on this figure the statistics in this report are based. A Census of the population of the County of London will be taken, in accordance with the provisions of the Equalisation of Rates Act, on March 29th of this year, so that our population as enumerated will shortly be known. Area and Density of the Population. The area of Fulham is 1,701 acres, and there are 65 persons to the acre. The County of London has an average density of 58.8 persons to the acre, ranging from 211 and 4 197 in St. George's, Southwark, and Whitechapel, to 18,??? and 9 persons to the acre in Wandsworth, Lewisham and Plumstead respectively. The four most crowded enumerat ??? districts in Fulham, with an area of about 33 acres, containd in 1891 a population of 8,880 persons, or 269 to the acre. Age and Sex Distribution. The following Table gives the estimated number persons living in Fulham at different age periods:— Under 5 • • • • • • • • • • • • 15,672 5 to 15 • • • • • • • • • • • • 25,009 15 „ 25 • • • • • • • • • • • • 19,118 25 „ 35 • • • • • • ... ... 20,007 35 „ 45 • • • • • • • • • • • • 14,1 l6 45 „ 55 • • • • • • • • • • • • • 8,670 55 „ 65 • • • • • • • • • • • • 5,002 65 „ 75 ... • • • • • • • • • 2,667 Over 75 • • • • • • • • • • • • 889 111,150 The following Table gives the number of persons a different ages in Fulham, London and other areas, expresse in percentages of the total population:— Under 5 5-15 15-25 25-35 35-45 45-55 55-65 65-75 Oven 75 Fulham 14.1 22.5 17.2 18.0 12.7 7.8 4.5 2.4 0.8 London 11.9 20.5 20.1 17.3 12.4 8.7 5.2 2.9 1.0 Rural Districts 12.3 23.7 17.8 13.4 10.7 8.8 6.7 4.6 2.0 Urban Districts 12.3 22.5 19.9 15.7 11.8 8.5 5.3 3.0 1.0 England & Wales 12.3 22.8 19.3 15.1 11.5 8.6 5.7 3.4 1.3 The differences in the age constitution of the districts given in the above table are considerable, and similar 5 differences will be found in comparing the age and sex distribution in the various London districts; and as age and sex constitution has a considerable influence on the death-rate of a community, the recorded death-rates require correction before they can be used for purposes of comparison. The age and sex distribution in Fulham is more favourable to a low death-rate than that of England, but not so favourable as that of London as a whole, nor as that of the adjoining parishes. MARRIAGES AND MARRIAGE RATE. 809 marriages were celebrated in Fulham during the year, against 759, 735 and 789 in the three preceding years. The marriage rate, i.e., persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 14 5, the rate for the whole of London being 17.1, and for England and Wales 15.0. BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE. The births registered in the year numbered 3,930; 1,993 males and 1,937 females. There was one birth to every 28 inhabitants, and 100 births of males to 97.2 of females. The 3,930 births correspond to a birth-rate of 35 3, which was lower than the average of the last ten years, but considerably higher than that of London, which was 30.5, and that of the western group of sanitary areas excluding Fulham, which was 23.5. In the other Sanitary Districts the rates ranged from 46.8. 43.7 and 38.9, in St. Luke's, St. George's-in-the-East and Mile End, to 18.8, 16.4 and 14.0 in Hampstead, the City of London and St. Martin's-in-the-Fields respectively. Among the 33 large towns of England and Wales the nighest rates were those of Liverpool, 36.9; Wolverhampton, 35.4, and Sunderland, 35.1; and the lowest those of Croydon, 25.3; Halifax, 23.1, and Huddersfield, 21.7 6 The following Table gives the number of birth registered in Fulham, together with the birth-rate during the last 10 years:- Males. Females. Total. R ???. 1886 ... 1395 1285 2680 39.4 1887 ... 1412 1458 2870 39.3 1888 ... 1577 1406 2983 38.2 1889 ... 1522 1567 3089 37.2 1890 ... 1551 1593 3144 35.7 1891 ... 1814 1733 3547 374 1892 ... 1835 1761 3596 35.4 1893 ... 1860 1851 3711 35.4 1894 ... 1937 1826 3763 34.9 1895 ... 1993 1937 3930 35.3 The erection during the last four or five years of a co siderable number of moderate-sized "flats" tenanted large by unmarried persons or by those with small familie probably accounts for the diminution of the birth-rate. Excess of Births over Deaths. The natural increase of the population by excess??? births over deaths was 1735, compared with 1428, 1671 an 1866 in the three preceding years. Illegitimate Children. The births of illegitimate children numbered 141—7 males and 66 females, forming 3.6 per cent. of the total births. Still-horn Children. 182 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery being in the proportion of 1 still-born child to every 21??? births. It is to be regretted that no steps have yet been taker to carry out the recommendations of the Select Committee of the House of Commons for the improvement of Death Certificates and Registration, mentioned in previous reports that still-births should be registered upon the certificate of 2 7 registered medical practitioner, and that it should not be permitted to bury or otherwise dispose of the still-birth until an order for burial has been issued by the Registrar. DEATHS AND DEATH RATE. The deaths of 2337 persons—1140 males and 1197 females—were registered in Fulham during the year; but of these 360 were of persons not belonging to the district, who died in public institutions within the parish, while the deaths of 218 persons belonging to Fulham occurred in institutions situated outside the parish. There were therefore 2195 deaths of parishioners of Fulham, compared with 2,068, 2024 and 1897 in the three preceding years, the mortality being at the rate of 19.7 per 1,000 living, the death-rates for the preceding three years having been 19.9, 19.3 and 17.6. The rate for the whole of London was 19.4, or slightly below the average for the ten years, 1885 to 1894, which was 19.8 The lowest rates in the 43 sanitary areas were 12 0 in Hampstead, 13.4 in Stoke Newington, 14.4 in Lewisham, 14.5 in Lee, 14 8 in Wandsworth, 15.2 in Plumstead, and 15.9 in St. George's, Hanover Square; and the highest 25.2 in Holborn, 25.3 in the Strand, 25.4 in St. George's, Southwark, 25.5 in St. Saviour's, Southwark, 27.3 in Limehouse, 29.5 in St. George's-in-the-East, and 30.2 in St. Luke's. Among the 33 large towns in England and Wales the owest rates were those of Croydon 14.5, Derby 16.7, Huddersfield 16.8, Leicester 17.2,'West Ham 17.8, Bristol 8.0, Cardiff 18.2, Swansea 18.38, Brighton 18.9; and the highest those of Bolton 24.0, Wolverhampton 24.3, Blackurn 24.3, Manchester 25.2, Salford 25.6, and Liverpool 87. Correction for Age and Sex Distribution. The death-rate of Fulham corrected for Age and Sex Distribution was 20.6, and that of London 20.7. 8 The following Table gives the death-rates of Fulhan and of London during the past 10 years:— Fulham Death-rate per 1.000. London Death-rat per 1,000. 1886 • • • • • • 19.0 20.5 1887 • • • • • • 19.5 20.3 1888 • • • • • • 19.1 19.3 1889 • • • • • • 18.8 18.3 1890 • • • • • • 21.7 21.5 1891 • • • • • • 19.7 21.0 1892 • • • • • • 20.0 20.3 1893 • • • • • • 19.3 20.9 1894 • • • • • • 17.6 17.4 1895 • • • • • • 19.7 19.4 Seasonal Mortality. 736 deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year, 429 in the second, 518 in the third, and 512 in the fourth— the effect of the severe weather in the early part of the year being very marked. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. Infantile Mortality. Of the 2195 deaths registered, 735 or 33 per cent. were those of children under one year of age. The rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered was 187, as compared with 166, 177 and 149 for the previous 3 years. The rate for the whole of London was 165, ranging from 116 in Stoke Newington, 132 in Wandsworth, 133 in Plumstead, 135 in Hampstead and Lewisham, and 138 in St. George's, Hanover Square, to 201 in Newington, 202 in Limehouse, 205 in St. Saviours, Southwark, 212 in Holborn, and 265 in St. Martin-in-the-Fields. In the large provincial towns the lowest rates were 134 in Croydon, 143 in Bristol, and 158 in Halifax and Huddersfield; the highest were 236 in Blackburn, 242 in Burnley, and 248 in Preston. 9 Between the ages of i and 5 years 366 deaths were registered, so that the deaths of children under the age of 5 years numbered 1,101, 01 50 per cent, of the total number of deaths. These deaths were equal to an annual rate of 70.2 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at this age. Deaths of Illegitimate Children. 67 of the children who died before attaining the age of one year were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 475 deaths to 1,000 births, or nearly three times as heavy as that of children born in wedlock. Insurance of Infants. Certificates under the Friendly Societies' Acts were issued during the year in respect of 481 children under the age of 5 years, and 55 in respect of those between 5 and 10; thus 43 per cent, of the children who died before attaining the age of 5 were insured. In 1893 the proportion was 48 and in 1894 50 per cent. Mortality at School Age. At the age of 5 to 15 years, which is approximately the school period of life, there were 86 deaths, corresponding to an annual rate of 3.5 per 1,000 of the population estimated to be living at that age. Mortality at Adolescence. At the age of 15 to 25 years 57 deaths were recorded, the rate of mortality being 2.9. Mortality at Maturity. At the age of 25 to 65 years there were 623 deaths, a number equivalent to a death-rate of 127. Mortality at Decline. At the age of 65 and over, 328 persons died, the deathrate at this age-period being 92.5. 10 Deaths and Death Rate from Zymotic Diseases. 343 deaths were due to the seven principal Zymotic Diseases, viz.:— Smallpox — Scarlet Fever 21 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 77 Enteric Fever 12 Measles 50 Whooping Cough 50 Diarrhoea 133 343 These 343 deaths correspond to a death-rate of 3.1 per 1,000. During the past 10 years the number of deaths and the death-rate from these diseases have been as under:— Deaths. Death Rate. 1886 253 37 1887 269 3.6 1888 252 3.2 1889 243 2.9 1890 379 4.3 1891 211 2.3 1892 448 3.5 1893 344 3.3 1894 426 3.9 1895 345 3.1 the average for the 10 years being 3.4. The Zymotic death-rate for the whole of London was 2'6, and the average rate for the last 10 years 27. In the various sanitary areas the rates ranged from 1.0 in Hampstead, 1.1 in Stoke Newington, 1.3 in St. James, Westminster and in Wandsworth, to 3.8 in Shoreditch, 3.9 in Clerkenwell. 8 in Mile End, 4.0 in Poplar, 4.6 in Limehouse, and 5.5 in St. Luke's and St. George's-in-the-East. 11 Among the 33 large towns the lowest rates were those of Huddersfield 1.2, Bristol 1.3, Croydon 1.3 Halifax 1.3, Brighton 17, and the highest those of Liverpool 4.0 Wolverhampton 4 a, Bolton 4.4, Salford 4.0, and Black. burn 5.6 Excess of Zymotic Diseases in Fulham. The excess of Zymotic Diseases in Fulham as compared with London and the adjoining parishes will be seen from the following Table:- se. Actual number of deaths in Fulham. Fulham's proportion if mortality was the same as in London. Fulham's proportion if mortality was the same as in 3 adjoining Western districts viz., Hammersmith, Chelsea&Kensington Smallpox 0 1 6 Scarlet Fever 21 21 22 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 77 57 57 Enteric Fever 12 14 11 Measles 50 66 22 Whooping Cough 50 36 33 Diarrhœa 133 90 88 But in considering these figures the relative proportion of children under 15 in the respective population must be taken into consideration, as all these diseases, with the exception of Enteric Fever and Smallpox, are mainly fatal to young children. In Fulham 26.6 per cent. of the population are under the age of 15 years, whereas in London and the other western districts under consideration, the respective proportions are: 22.4 and 20.1 per cent. 12 NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The following Table gives the number of cases of infectious diseases notified in Fulham since 1890, where compulsory notification came into force, excluding duplicated notifications:— 1890. 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894. 1895. Smallpox — — 3 32 40 2 Scarlet Fever 286 118 517 701 529 339 Diphtheria 70 69 96 230 329 368 Membranous Croup 23 13 15 20 13 18 Enteric Fever 72 51 41 58 37 57 Continued Fever - - — 6 2 3 Typhus Fever 2 3 — 1 — - Cholera — - — 5 — — Puerperal Fever 6 9 10 18 10 6 Erysipelas 114 67 104 153 113 94 573 330 786 1224 1073 887 Smallpox. Two cases were notified. In one case the disease was contracted in Shoreditch; in the other the source of infection could not be traced. 1,076 cases were notified in London during the year, Fulham being conspicuously free from the disease. Scarlet Fever. 339 cases were notified of this disease, which was less prevalent in Fulham than during the three preceding years. There were 2.9 cases per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with 4.9 per 1,000 in the whole of London, and 6.4, 4.0 and 3.1 for the neighbouring parishes of Chelsea, Hammersmith and Kensington. 13 The distribution of the cases was as under Population in 1891.

Mortality.—The disease was the cause of 21 deaths, representing a case mortality of 6 per cent. Of the 237 removed to Hospital, 19 or 8.o per cent. died, and of the ???92 who remained at home, 2 or 2.2 per cent. died. Want of Accommodation in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board. The number of cases removed would have been larger had the accommodation at the Hospitals of the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board been adequate, but about the middle of July the accommodation for Scarlet Fever patients in the Board's Hospitals was exhausted, and patients could only be removed as vacancies occurred borough death or recovery, so that although the removal only of the most urgent cases was requested, a delay of ???veral days often occurred before this could be done; ??? some instances the removal was deferred so long that ultimately the patient remained at home until recovery. There were also many cases where removal was desired by he parents, but no application was made for removal as other more urgent cases were awaiting admission. 14 Some idea of the number of these cases may be gathered from the fact, that, during the first six months of the year, when the accommodation was ample, over 80 per cent. of the notified cases were removed as compared with under 60 per cent. in the last six months. When it was evident that the accommodation at the Board's Hospitals was inadequate, the Clerk to the Asylums' Board wrote to the Vestry, stating, "that as the available accommodation at the Board's Hospitals was nearly exhausted, new cases could only be admitted as vacancies were occasioned by discharges and deaths, and expressing a hope that instructions would be given by the Vestry to the officers concerned, to arrange for preference being given to the removal of those patients who, as a consequence of their surroundings and conditions of life, are most in need of hospital treatment." In reply to the Board's request respecting the "selection of cases,” the Vestry pointed out that it was of little use for their officers to endeavour to select the most urgent cases, if the officers of the Asylums' Board use their own discretion in the removal of patients, as was the case when the hospitals were full in 1893, as then patients were removed from this Parish in spite of the Medical Officer of Health having telegraphed to the Board that he considered them well isolated, and that other more urgent cases were awaiting removal. The Vestry informed the Board that they were of opinion that when the available accommodation at the Managers' hospitals is so limited, no cases should be removed except at the request of the Medical Officer of Health, for the district, as he was in a position to know the circumstances and surroundings of all the patients notified to him as suffering from infectious diseases, and could therefore form an opinion as to which were really the most urgent cases. It is, however, to be regretted that the Managers of the Asylums' Board persisted in having the selection of patients for the beds becoming vacant daily by deaths or discharges, made by the officers employed in the Ambulance Department of the Asylums' Board. To the request of the Vestry that their officials should be consulted with as to the 15 urgency of cases, the Clerk to the Asylums' Board replied that “it is quite impossible for them to take counsel with the Medical Officer of Health or any local officials as to the selection of the most urgent cases. The Managers' own officers must determine to the best of their ability from the information supplied to them, which cases' wherever situated; and without in the least claiming that this arrangement works absolutely faultlessly, I am satisfied that on the whole the best selection possible is arrived at." One fails to see why it should be impossible for the Asylums' Board to take counsel with the local officials as to the selection of urgent cases, for since the majority of the Sanitary Authorities are in telephonic communication with the Board, it would apparently be a very simple matter. That the best selection possible is made by the present system is more than questionable. As the Vestry are aware cases have been removed in spite of the Medical Officer of Health having telegraphed to the Board that he considered them well isolated, and that other more urgent cases were awaiting admission. On another occasion, when vacant beds were in great demand, a child was removed from this parish to the hospital four days after I had received a certificate from the medical practitioner in attendance that the child had recovered and that the premises were ready for disinfection. Again, on telephoning for the removal of a case I have been informed that it was impossible for any cases to be removed that day and that it was useless to give particulars, and yet within two or three hours on the same afternoon a child was removed on the application, subsequent to my telephoning, of a private individual, I would further point out that complaints respecting the Managers' method of selection of cases are by no means confined to this parish, but are general throughout London. The Medical Officer of Health lor Islington has drawn the attention of the Board to the unsatisfactory selection of cases by the existing method. The Medical Officer for Camberwell points out that cases have been removed to the hospitals which have never appeared on the lists of patients urgently requiring removal, 16 which he has sent to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, a this has occurred while he has been asking for the removed of other cases where it was specially necessary that the person suffering should be treated at a hospital. The Medical Officer for St. George-the-Martyr states “There is reason to suspect that cases which might ha been fairly isolated at home have gained entry in the Asylum Hospitals to the exclusion of members of familiar living in one or two rooms, often situated in large bloc??? buildings.'' From this it is pretty clear that with the existing method "the best selection possible" is by no means attained, b?? the Managers apparently wish to maintain a position ??? autocratic independence of the Sanitary Authorities. Return Cases. In 9 instances the disease occurred within 10 days o?? the return of another member of the family from the Hospital after a similar attack. The occurrence of these "return" cases has attracted considerable attention of late and in June last I submitted a return, to the Vestry, of the cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria that occurred in houses, in Fulham. within ten days of the return home of a discharged patient from one of the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, between January 1st, 1894, and May 15th, 1895, giving particulars of 33 cases. A report of a Sub-Committee of the Asylums Board, appointed to inquire into the matter, was issued towards the end of the year. As the result of their consideration of the whole question, the Committee have arrived at the following conclusions:— (a) That there is no evidence to show that any appreciable number of patients admitted to the Board's Hospitals during the past two years have contracted infection from patients previously discharged therefrom. 17 That there is reason to believe that of the so-called "return" cases some have been due to the re-introduction of infection into households owing to the disturbance of insufficiently disinfected clothes, etc., left at home and stored away during the patients' stay in Hospital. (b) That it is desirable that those Sanitary Authorities in the Metropolitan District who have not yet provided themselves with steam disinfectors should be urged to do so with the least possible delay; and, further, that the Authorities who still entrust the work of disinfection to contractors should be advised to discontinue the practice, and to have the work carried out by responsible officials. With regard to their statement that there is no evidence to show that any appreciable number of cases have occurred, I would point out that the conclusions of the Sub-Committee 'are based upon inaccurate figures. They state that they find from evidence supplied by the several Metropolitan Medical Officers, as to the outbreak of illness in households after the return home of recovered patients from the Board's Fever Hospitals, that only 165 cases of alleged infection from discharged patients were recorded. Of these 165 cases, 49 occurred during the first half of the present year, 1895, and 10 during the year 1891-1892, leaving 106 for the two years 1893 and 1894, during which time 30,227 patients who had been suffering from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria were discharged from the Hospitals of the Board. This gives one case of insection for every 285 discharges. But on looking through the abstract of the replies given by the Medical Officers of Health, it will be seen that this by no means represents the ???rue proportion, as in the first place, several Medical Officers of Health state, that though many such cases have occurred in their districts, they are unable to give details, but in the Committee's report it is assumed that no cases have occurred in these districts. Again, the figures given by the 18 Committee are based on the proportion of return cases t??? discharged patients in 1893 and 1894, but there is nothing in any of the abstracts of the reports of the Medical Officer to show that they have given all the "return" cases that came to their knowledge in these two years; in fact, i??? the return I sent, only those were given that occurred i??? 1894 and the early months of 1895, while the number c??? such cases in 1893 was, proportionately, quite as great similarly in the return from Chelsea, particulars are given o??? the "return" cases that occurred in that parish from February, 1894, to April, 1895, and none are given that occurred in 1893, though from a footnote in the report one gathers that they were more numerous in that year Another remarkable feature of the Committee's report is that they have omitted to take into account any of the cases that occurred in Islington. The report states, with regard to this parish, that the Medical Officer of Health, having been previously in correspondence with the Managers and the Local Government Board on the subject, was not written to, and consequently the Committee actually assume that in this parish, which is the largest in London, having a??? population thrice that of Fulham there were no “return" cases, whereas it was largely owing to the action of the Vestry of Islington, consequent on the number of cases that occurred in their parish, that this enquiry was instituted. It must be evident from the above that the proportion of "return cases to discharges is really much higher than that given by the Committee. As to the other conclusions of the Committee, I pointed out in my last annual report when dealing with the "return" cases of Scarlet Fever, that "in some instances it is quite possible that the infection was conveyed by some article of clothing which had been worn by the first patient at the commencement of the illness, put away without being disinfected and on his return again brought into use.” For although the disinfector is most careful to remove every article from the room occupied by the patient, and always enquires for anything that may have been removed from the room, it is clearly impossible to ensure the removal of every article that has been in contact with the patient. 19 There is, however, not the slightest evidence in proof of the suggestion of the Committee, that the disinfection of infected articles is inefficiently carried out in this parish. True, the disinfection is done by a Contractor, and although as I have stated in a report to the Vestry, "it cannot be regarded as entirely satisfactory that the arrangements for disinfection should be in other hands than of those who are responsible for the prevention of disease, there can be no doubt but that the work is thoroughly well done, and the existing plan has the advantage that it is always equal to any demands made upon it, whatever the amount of work required to be done, be it great or small." The portion of the Committee's report giving the Abstract of the Replies of the Medical Superintendents of the Board's Fever Hospitals to the enquiries of the SubCommittee, as to what precautions are taken with the patients before the discharge, is eminently satisfactory, and it is evident that every precaution is taken by the Medical Superintendents to insure as far as possible that no patient shall be discharged until free from infection. But that a certain number of these "return" cases should occur seems to be unavoidable, for their occurrence in a certain proportion is universal wherever hospital isolation is practised. As Dr. Caiger, the Medical Superintendent of the South Western Hospital, remarks: "We are unfortunately unable to sterilise a human being by passing him through a steam disinfector as one does his clothes, and I am firmly convinced that until infection can be demonstrated as a visible quantity, even with the exercise of the greatest care on the part of Hospital and Sanitary Officers alike, the so.called return cases will from time to time arise. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 368 cases of Diphtheria and 18 of Membranous Croup, which is identical with Laryngeal Diphtheria, were notified during the year, as against 96, 250 and 342 in the three preceding years. 20 The distribution of the cases was as under:— Population in 1891. Cases. Deaths.

During the first six months of the year, when there was ample accommodation in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board for all cases needing admission, 88 percent. of those notified were removed. Mortality.—The disease caused 77 deaths, giving a case mortality of 20 per cent., as compared with 26.1 per cent. in 1893, and 31.6 per cent. in 1894, so that looking at the figures as a whole the type of the disease would appear to have been milder than in the two previous years, but it is remarkable that the reduction in mortality has been entirely amongst the cases removed to Hospital, that of the cases treated at home being practically the same as in last year. The figures for the preceding years were:— Cases notified as Diphtheria removed to Hospital. Deaths.

The marked decline in the fatality c cases treated in the Hospitals, while that of the case treated ouside remain practically the same, naturally call attention to the treatment of Diphtheria by Anti.toxi Serum, which has been used in all cases of Diphtheria excepting those of a very mild type, that have been admitted into the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Boar during the year, while it was, I believe, used in only on case that remained at home. One cannot, of course, front the number of cases dealt with here, draw definite conclu??? sions as to the value of the Anti-toxic Serum, but it in certainly most significant that there should have been this reduction in the mortality in the Hospitals when the only new factor in the treatment is the use of Anti-toxic Serum??? and judging from the mortality of those treated at home the type of the disease has remained the same. Since the above was written, the Medical Superintendents of the Hospitals of the Asylums' Board have presented ??? report upon the use of Anti toxic Serum in the treatment ??? Diphtheria. The report is too lengthy to be dealt with fully here. A??? number of tables are given in the report showing the results obtained with the Serum, as compared with those of former years, and summarising the results observed, the Medical Superintendents state that:— The improved results in the Diphtheria cases treated during the year 1895, which are indicated by the foregoing statistics and clinical observations, are:— (i.) A great reduction in the mortality of cases brought under treatment on the first and second day of illness. (ii.) The lowering of the combined general mortality to a point below that of any former year. (iii.) The still more remarkable reduction in the mortality of the laryngeal cases. (iv.) The uniform improvement in the results of tracheotomy at each separate Hospital. (v.) The beneficial effect produced on the clinical course of the disease. 23 A consideration of the foregoing statistical tables and clinical observations, covering a period of 12 months, and embracing a large number of cases, in our opinion sufficiently demonstrates the value of anti-toxin in the treatment of Diphtheria. It must be clearly understood, however, that to obtain the largest measure of success with Anti-toxin it is essential that the patient be brought under its influence at a comparatively early date—if possible not later than the second day of disease. From this time onwards the chance of a successful issue will diminish in proportion to the length of time which has elapsed before the treatment is commenced. This, though doubtless true of other methods, is of still greater moment in the case of treatment, by Anti-toxin. Certain secondary effects not infrequently arise as a direct result of the injection of Anti-toxin in the form in which it has at present to be administered, and even assuming that the incidence of the normal complications of Diphtheria is greater than can be accounted for by the increased number of recoveries, we have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that these drawbacks are insignificant when taken in conjunction with the lessened fatality which has been associated with the use of this remedy. We are further of opinion that in Anti.toxic Serum we possess a remedy of distinctly greater value in the treatment of Diphtheria than any other with which we are acquainted. The fact that the treatment was successful in proportion as it was adopted at an early stage of the disease, is very clearly shown by the statistics given. Of the 86 treated with Anti-toxin on the first day of the disease only 4, or 4.6 per cent., and of 403 treated on the second dav, 60, or 14.8 succumbed, the rate rising to 357 per cent. in those treated after the fifth day; while in 1894, of 133 admitted on the first day of the disease, 30 or 22.5 per cent.; and of 539 admitted on the second day, 146, or 27 per cent., died, the rate rising to 31.6 per cent. in those admitted after the fourth day. But the report of the Medical Superintendent of the Northern Hospital which is appended to the general report, is a still more striking illustration of the value of Anti-toxin, especially, when used in the early stages of the disease. He states that of 119 cases of post-scarlatinal Diphtheria occurring in this hospital, 58 (being the severer cases) were treated with Anti-toxin, of which on vour died. 24 The mortality in 1895, as compared with that of previous years, shown by the following Table, which gives the age incidence and mortal for the past six years:— AGE. 1890-94. 1895. Cases. Deaths. Mortality per cent. All Cases. Deaths. Mortality per cent. Anti-toxin Cases. Deaths. Mortality per cent. Under 5 56 48 857 | 31 2 6.4 18 2 11.1 5 to 10 81 46 567 1 2 3.3 29 2 6.9 10 „ 15 22 7 31.8 22 0 0.0 9 0 0.0 Over 15 9 3 33.3 6 0 0.0 2 0 0.0 Total 168 104 61.9 119 4 3.3 58 4 6.8 There is no reason to suppose that there has been any change in the type of disease coincidently with the introduction of the Anti-toxin treatment. The cases of 1895 were in the irearliest symptoms similar to those of previous years, and the fact that the local and constitutional conditions which were formerly so fatal have not supervened, may reasonably be ascribed to the new treatment employed. This opinion is confirmed by the recovery of cases which, both from laryngeal obstruction and severity of constitutional symptoms, would in pre-anti-toxin days have been regarded as hopeless. Dr. Hume also remarks:— “That the mortalities of the laryngeal cases in the last two years are in striking contrast; in 1895, 7 out of 8 recovered, in 1894 9 cases, all died, and the only new factor in the treatment of post-scarlatinal Diphtheria at their Hospital is Anti-toxin. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that there must be some connection between the new method of treatment and the great reduction of mortality." 25 School Influence The following Table gives the number of children attending the Board and other primary schools in Fulham, who were notified each month as suffering from Diphtheria.

Prevalence of Diphtheria in Fulham. Diphtheria, though not so fatal as in 1894, was more prevalent in Fulham than in the Metropolis as a whole, the rate of incidence per 1,000 inhabitants being 3.4 as compared with 25 for London. The rate was also in excess of that of the neighbouring parishes, but it may be remarked that it was slightly below that of Chelsea, if the outlying portion of that parish, Kensal Town, be excluded, the rate for Chelsea Home District being 3.5. The death-rate from Diphtheria was for Fulham, 07, and for London, 0.5. The following table gives the rate of incidence of Diphtheria in Fulham, London, and adjoining parishes for the past five years:— Rate per i,ooo Inhabitants 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 Fulham 71 1.03 2.21 3.15 3.4 London 1.42 1.85 3.02 2.44 2.45 Hammersmith 2.92 2.75 2.65 1.74 1.83 Chelsea 1.8o 1.74 2.31 2.56 3.3 Kensington 1.11 1.04 2.14 1.61 2.18 Enteric or Typhoid Fever. Fifty-seven cases were notified, the numbers for the three preceding years being 41, 58 and 37, and the disease was the cause of 12 deaths, the case mortality being 21 per cent. In at least 12 cases the disease was contracted outside the parish. The death-rate in Fulham from Enteric Fever was the same as that of London, viz.: 0.1 per 1,000. Continued Fever. Three cases were notified, one of which proved fatal. 27 Puerperal Fever. Six cases were notified, of which four proved fatal, the deaths from septic poisoning after childbirth being in the proportion of 1.0 deaths to 1,000 births. Each of the six patients was attended by a different medical practitioner and nurse. Erysipelas. Ninety.four cases of this disease were notified, and it was the cause of six deaths, three being of children under one year of age. NON.NOTIFIABLE ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Measles. This disease was the cause of 50 deaths, the average for the preceding 19 years, allowing for the increase of population, being 88. The death.rate for Fulham was .4, and for London .6. The question of the advisability of adding Measles to the list of notifiable diseases, I dealt with in my report for 1894. Whooping Cough. Whooping Cough was the cause of 50 deaths, the average number for the preceding eight years being 57. Of these, 29 were children under one year of age, and 29 of children between one and five years. The death.rates for Fulham and London from this disease were 0.54 and 0.48 per 1,000 respectively. Although the case mortality of Whooping Cough is low, the disease kills more children than any Zymotic disease except Diarrhoea. Unfortunately, it is always looked upon as a very trivial ailment, and comparatively little care is taken of the sufferers, who usually succumb to one of the pulmonary complications of the disease induced by neglect. 28 Diarrhœa. Under the heading Diarrhoea are included several different affections, confounded with one another on account of the presence of Diarrhœa as a symptom, but there is no doubt that Summer Diarrhœa, which is so fatal to young children, is essentially a specific disease. 133 deaths were ascribed to Diarrhoea, the average for the nine previous years, allowing for the increase of the population, being 107. In addition to these deaths, the majority of the deaths of infants, 32 in number, ascribed to Gastro-Enteritis, or Gastro-Enteric Catarrh, were probably of the same nature. The death-rate from the disease was 1.2, and for the whole of the Metropolis .8. In the 33 large towns the mortality caused by Diarrhœa was 1.2, and considerably exceeded the average rate, .8, of the preceding 10 years. The lowest rates were .48 in Huddersfield, .52 in Plymouth, .56 in Croydon and *58 in Halifax; the highest rates were 2.1 in Burnley and Blackburn, 2 4 in Hull and 2.5 in Preston; the high mortality being mainly due to the hot summer. With but four exceptions, all the infants who succumbed were hand-fed. Although the atmospheric heat by its depressing influence acts directly as a predisposing cause, it is mainly harmful indirectly by facilitatingthe putrefaction of the milk, and other artificial foods on which the infants are fed. The agency which in midsummer, in our crowded districts, causes fatal Diarrhoea among hand.fed children, does not reside in the animal milk per se, but must be sought solely in the alterations of the drawn milk, resulting from the access of atmospheric air more or less polluted with emanations from sewers and decaying refuse, and from the imperfect cleansing of the vessels in which the milk is kept, and of the bottles, tubes and mouthpieces through which it is administered. Most of these conditions are dependent on the habits of the parents of the children; still, much can be done by the Sanitary Authority by a more frequent removal in summer of house and other refuse, and by the abolition of that fertile source of danger, the present system of sewer ventilation. 29 But in connection with the contamination of milk the results of a bacteriological examination of sample's of London milk by Mr. Sydney Rowland, recently published are of the greatest interest. His investigations clearly show that milk is largely polluted before it reaches the consumer. Normal milk, as it exists in the udder of the healthy cow, is perfectly sterile, while the average number of organisms found in the samples examined was 500,000 per cubic centimetre (about 15 drops), but the most significant fact is that the organism found in the greatest abundance, constituting 90 per cent. of all the forms found, was that known as the Bacillus Coli Communis, which is unquestionably diagnostic of fœcal contamination, and finds its way into the milk from the unclean bodies of the cows and from the polluted air of the stables and stalls in which the milking is carried on. Mr. Rowland remarks:— “With regard to this extraordinary number of Bacteria, it is not difficult to imagine their source if, for a moment, one recalls the usual conditions of the cows in even the cleanest and most hygienically managed of our dairies. The stable or cowshed in which the milking is carried on is itself saturated with excremental matter; the very straw the animals stand upon is too often but an incubating ground for microorganisms, for, warmed by fermentation and saturated with fœcal matter, it offers all the conditions of warmth and nutriment material for their best growth. The restlessness of the animals and the walking of the milkman disturb at each moment myriads of these micro-organisms, some of which, passing into the open air, find in the warm milk all the conditions for life and active multiplication." Since the determining influence of the Bacillus Coli in cases of Infantile Diarrhoea and other intestinal complaints has been clearly shown, its presence in milk, especially in milk used for infant feeding, cannot but be a grave source of danger. Numerous other organisms were also present, such as are found in putrefying organic matter of all descriptions, which show either direct contamination with putrefying matter, or exposure to an atmosphere containing particles of decomposing matter. It is clear from this it is necessary, that in addition to a rigid supervision of the retailing shops, steps should be taken to enforce an improvement in the surroundings of the cows, and in the conditions under which milking is carried on so as to secure, as far as possible, absolute cleanliness 30 both in the milking, and in the subsequent conveyance of the milk to, and its sojourn in, the shop of the retailer. Meanwhile the necessity for boiling milk, especially that intended for infants, cannot be too strongly urged, though that this should be essential constitutes a serious indictment of the methods under which the milk trade is carried on. Influenza. Sixty.six deaths were directly attributed to Influenza, the highest number recorded in any year. The outbreak of this disease in London arose with its characteristic suddenness about the middle of February, rapidly culminated, and then steadily subsided, as may be seen from the following Table, which gives the deaths 111 rulham and in London during th weeks when it was prevalent:— Fulham. London. Week ending Feb. 16 1 24 „ „ „ 23 6 111 „ „ March 2 15 296 „ „ „ 9 17 473 ,, ,, ,, 16 9 349 ,, „ „ 23 4 225 „ „ „ 30 4 116 „ „ April 6 1 63 „ „ „ 13 1 46 „ „ „ 20 1 32 The disease was proportionally somewhat more fatal in Fulham than in the rest of London, the death-rates being 0.6 for Fulham and 0.5 for the whole of London. The mortality among elderly people from the disease showed a marked excess, 18 of the deaths being of persons over 65 years of age. This corresponds to a death-rate of 5 0 per 1000 persons estimated to be living at that age, while the remaining 47 deaths occurring among persons under 65 years of age were equal to 0.4 per 1000 persons living at that age period. In other words among equal numbers living, to one death from Influenza among persons aged under 65, there were 13 deaths among persons aged upwards of 65. 31 Since the disease reached this country from the East at the close of 1889, there have been in all six marked outbreaks in London, viz., (1) in the winter of 1889.1890; (2) in the spring and summer of 1891' (3) in the winter of 1891-1892; (4) in the spring of 1893; (5) in the winter of 1893-1894, and the present one. It would appear that the Influenzal germ or virus still persists in places where it was introduced, and that some local conditions serve from time to time to bring about its renewed activity and virulence. Last year the outbreak coincided with the prolonged and severe frost, but hitherto no concordance has been established between Influenza and any special climatic condition. It is possible that the general insanitary state of the majority of the houses, owing to the accumulation of filth consequent on frozen soil pipes, waterless closets, and the difficulty of promptly removing the house refuse, owing to the barges not being able to leave the wharf, may have had some influence in promoting the spread of the disease. Septic Diseases. From Septic diseases, other than Erysipelas and Puerperal Fever, there were three deaths. Venereal Diseases. Eighteen deaths were attributed to these diseases, of which 16 were due to Congenital Syphilis. CLASS III.—DIETETIC DISEASES. Nine deaths were stated to be directly due to alcoholic excess. Probably, if the recommendation of the Select Committee of the House of Commons for the improvement of death certificates and registration, that medical practitioners should be required to send certificates of death to the Registrar, instead of handing them to the representatives of the deceased," were carried out, the number of deaths in this class would be materially increased. 32 CLASS IV.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. The number of deaths from diseases in this group were 365, being 16.6 per cent. of the total number of deaths. Of these, 153 were due to Phthisis and 93 to other tubercular diseases, as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenterica and General Tuberculosis, these diseases thus accounting for 11 per cent. of all the deaths; and it is probable that many of the deaths ascribed to Marasmus, Debility and Con. vulsions were also of a Tubercular nature. Eighty-one deaths were registered from Cancer, 66 being of persons of 45 years and upwards. Rheumatic Fever was responsible for seven deaths, and Chronic Rheumatism and Gout for six. CLASS V.—DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES. From diseases of this class 162 deaths were certified, 112 being of infants from premature birth, atelectasis, or non-inflation of lungs, and congenital malformation; and 50 deaths were returned as due to “old age." CLASS VI.—LOCAL DISEASES. The diseases of this group were responsible for 998 deaths, or 45.5 per cent. of the total number, the following being the principal classes:— 1.—Diseases of Nervous System. From these there were 193 deaths, 65 being from Apoplexy, etc., 29 from Insanity and General Paralysis of the Insane, and 38 from Convulsions. 2.— Diseases of the Circulatory System. Diseases of the Heart and Blood.vessels were accountable for 115 deaths. 3.—Diseases of Respiratory System. From these diseases, Phthisis being excluded, there were 498 deaths, or 22 per cent. of the deaths from all causes. 33 Of these Pneumonia was responsible for 199, and Bronchitis for 281 deaths. The heavy mortality from these diseases during March and April, will be noticed in referring to Table. 4.—Diseases of Reproductive System. Eight deaths were registered in this class, four being due to diseases of parturition. The total number of deaths recorded as occurring within 21 days of childbirth was 15, the causes assigned being the following:— Septic Diseases 4 Flooding and other Accidents of Childbirth 3 Pneumonia and Bronchitis 3 Scarlet Fever 1 Influenza 2 Cerebral Hemorrhage 1 Peritonitis (Non-septic) 1 15 Or one death to 262 births. From the other classes of local diseases there were 184 deaths. CLASS VII.—DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE. Different forms of violence caused 82 deaths. Accident or Negligence. Fractures and Contusions 30 Burns 8 Drowning 5 Poison 2 Infants in Bed 15 Suffocation Otherwise 1 Other Injuries 8 69 Suicide. Cut, Stab 2 Gunshot Wounds 2 Drowning 1 Poison 2 Hanging 3 Otherwise 1 Homicide. 11 Murder 1 Manslaughter 1 — 82 The death-rate from violence was 0.74, as against 0.75 for London. CLASS VIII.—ILL.DEFINED AND NOT SPECIFIED CAUSES. Under this heading there were 139 deaths, the great majority, viz., 125, being certified as due to Debility,Inanition, or Marasmus. CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH. . Of the 2195 deaths registered, 1989, or 90.6 per cent., were duly certified by registered medical practitioners, and 196, or 8.9 per cent., by the Coroner after inquest, while the causes of 10, or 0.5 per cent., were uncertified. INQUESTS. Of the 196 inquests held on parishioners, 167 were held in the parish, and 29 at institutions outside. The subjects were, males, 108; females, 88; and their ages— Under 5 89 5 to 60 76 Over 60 31 114 deaths were due to natural causes and 82 to violence. 35 Those due to natural causes may be classified as follows:- Zymotic Diseases 12 Tubercular 4 Diseases of Respiratory Organs 29 Diseases of Circulatory System 24 Convulsions and other Diseases of the Nervous System 17 Alcoholism 4 Improper or Insufficient Food 3 Other Diseases 19 Cause not ascertained 2 114 The deaths due to violence have already been classified. UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. Six of these were of prematurely born infants who only lived a few hours ; of the others three were ascribed to heart disease, and one to pneumonia. The proportion of uncertified deaths was, in London, 0.9 per cent., and in England and Wales 2.5 per cent. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Fulham Union Infirmary and Workhouse. This institution situated in Fulham serves for the two Parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith. 417 deaths occurred in the Infirmary and 10 in the Workhouse; of these 240 were of parishioners of Fulham, and 187 of persons belonging to Hammersmith. Their ages and causes of death will be found in Table A. Western Fever Hospital. 215 deaths occurred at the Western Fever Hospital. Of these 51 were of parishioners, and 164 of persons belonging to other districts. Their ages and causes of death will be found in Table A. 36 Of the 2195 deaths registered, 504, or 22.9 per cent., tool place in public institutions, the proportion in London being 26.8 per cent. The percentages in the several classes of institutions were as under:— Fulham. London. In Workhouses and Workhouse Infirmaries 11.1 13.5 per cent.

The following Tables, furnished by Mr. Collins, the Vaccination Officer, gave the Vaccination returns for 1894. and for the first six months of 1895, those for the last six months not being yet complete:— Supplemental Return for 1894 for the Parish of Fulham. No. of Births Registered from 1st Jan., 1893, to 31st Dec, 1893. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible of Vaccination. Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed. Outstanding. 3792 3068 22 - 333 46 310 13 38 Return of Vaccination for the Period from January to June, 1895, Parish of Fulham. No. of Births Registered from ist Jan., to 30th June, 1894. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible of Vaccination. Had Small Pox. Dead. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed. Outstanding. 1966 1539 9 - 220 69 122 7 The return for 1894 is more satisfactory than that for 1893, only 8 per cent. of the children remaining unaccounted for, as against 10 per cent. in 1894, but in no other year has the number been more than 7 per cent. The Royal Commission on Vaccination, which has been sitting for nearly 7 years, has not yet issued its report, but there is every probability that it will be forthcoming this year. DISINFECTION. Infected articles were disinfected by the contractor, Mr. Lacy, Townmead Wharf, by whom the articles were also collected. Mr. Lacy's disinfecting plant is of the most approved pattern, and has proved fully equal to all demands made upon it. The infected articles were always promptly removed, and the work most efficiently done. The weight of the articles disinfected was 1022 cwt., and the amount paid by the Vestry to Mr. Lacy £638. Although, as I have stated, there can be no question that the disinfection is thoroughly and efficiently done by the contractor, it cannot be regarded as entirely satisfactorv that the arrangements for disinfection should be in other hands than of those who are responsible for the prevention of disease, and as the Vestry have now under consideration a scheme for the destruction of refuse, it will be advisable, should this be carried out, for disinfecting plant to be provided on the same site, as doubtless if this were done considerable economy would result both in the initial cost and the subsequent working. 39 Shelter. No shelter has yet been provided by the Vestry for the use of persons during the period necessary for the disinfection of their dwellings, and I would advise the Vestry to take this matter into consideration when dealin of with the scheme for a Dust Destructor and Disinfecting Station as the necessary rooms could easily be provided in connection with the latter. WATER SUPPLY. Reference was made in the report for 1894 to complaints of insufficient pressure in the West Middlesex Company's main, supplying the Queens Club Gardens' Estate, and the Company have since then laid down an additional main; Which has materially improved the service in that district. In common with the rest of London great discomfort was experienced by a large number of householders owing to the failure of the water supply consequent on the severe ??? There can be no doubt that many would not have ??? themselves without water if they had taken a few common-sense precautions, as it was not uncommon to find one or two houses in a street where a little trouble had been taken, supplied with water, while their neighbours, living under precisely similar conditions, were frozen out. There is, unfortunately, a great tendency for householders to do little or nothing for themselves, and then when any??? goes wrong to abuse either the Local Authority or a Company, as the case may be. In many instances, however, the failure of the supply was due to the freezing of the communication pipes and the ??? of the Company, owing to their having been laid at ??? insufficient depth. By the Regulations made by the Companies and approved ??? the Board of Trade as directed by the Water Act of ???, Sec. 17 to 25, it is ordered (Regulation 10) that every ??? hereafter laid for the conveyance of or in connection with water supplied by the Company shall when laid in open 40 ground be laid at least 2 feet 6 inches below the surface, ??? shall in every exposed situation be properly protected against the frost." This clause, it will be noticed, deals with the communication pipes, but it is obvious that if the service pipes should be laid at a depth of 30 inches, the mains also laid since 1872 should not have been laid at a less depth; but this is not the case, as some have been found to be at a depth varying from 15 to 28 inches, and there can be no doubt than if the regulations had been duly carried out many householders would have been spared great inconvenience Careful temperatures taken by Air. Sowerby, at the Botanical Gardens, show that the frost in that locality did not penetrate to quite 2 feet in the ground, so that although, of course, the nature of the soil in other places would cause a difference in the penetration of cold, probably if all main pipes had been laid at a depth not less than 30 inches, few would have been frozen. It was stated by the President of the Local Government Board in the House of Commons, "that on the assumption that the failure of the supply was due to the fact that the water had been frozen in the Companies' mains, and that that had been due to the pipes being laid at an insufficient depth, the Legislature appeared to have provided a course which might be adopted by those affected. The Metropolitan Water Act enacted that if at any time complaint as to the quantity or quality of the water supplied by a Company in London was made to the Local Government Board by memorial in writing signed bv not less than 20 inhabitant householders, paying rents, and supplied with water by a Company, it should be lawful for the Board within two months after the receipt of the report of such complaint to appoint some competent person to inquire into the ground of such complaint and report to the Board. The Act also provided that if after the receipt of such report it should appear that the complaint was well-founded the Board should give notice in writing to the Company and that after the receipt of such notice the Company should be required to remove, within a reasonable time, the ground of such complaint. He was advised that the provisions of the Act which 41 exempted the Water Companies from penalties where the failure of the supply of water was due to frost, would not affect the provisions he had referred to. If, therefore complaint was made to him by 20 householders in any district in London he would be prepared to entertain it, subject to the opinion of Law Officers." The Vestry had under their consideration the question of petitioning the Local Government Board to hold an inquiry into the cause of the failure of the supply, but were unable to obtain sufficient evidence to justify them in taking this course. Numerous complaints were received of the inadequate supply of stand-pipes provided by the Companies for the use of consumers whose supply had failed owing to the frost, and also of the insufficient time that the stand-pipes were available for use, and letters were written to the Companies asking them to arrange for as many stand-pipes as possible, to be available the whole day, as the hardship to the ratepavers generallv, and especially to the poor, who had not sufficient receptacles for storing the water, was very great. The Companies expressed their wish to do everything in their power to lessen the inconvenience, and appear to have extended the time that the stand-pipes were available, and also supplemented them by the use of water-carts which they hired from the Vestry. Quality of the Water. A sample of water taken from the main of the West Middlesex Company in January was pronounced by the Public Analyst, Mr. Clayton, "to be of inferior quality, and the evidence of organic contamination to be too distinct to allow him to view the sample as desirable for dietetic use. With this exception the other samples taken were found to be suitable for drinking purposes. Water cut off by the Water Companies. During the year notices under Sec. 49 of the Public Health Act were given by the Companies in respect of 740 42 occupied houses from which the water had been cut off in a large proportion the supply having been cut off on account of burst pipes during the long frost. I have again to report that the Vestry have persisted in refusing to carry out the provisions of the Public Health Act, in respect of houses without a proper supply of water. SEWER VENTILATION. Constant complaints have as usual been received of the offensive smells arising from the manholes and surface ventilators, and a Committee has been appointed by the Vestry to enquire into the best method of ventilating the sewers, and is dealing exhaustively with the question, so that I hope that means may be devised to remedy the present admitted nuisance. Several shafts have been erected in various parts of the parish, with apparently satisfactory results, and extended use has been made of Syke's intercepting trap, to which I alluded in my last report, in some of the new streets near Wandsworth Bridge Road. HOUSE REFUSE. A weekly visit is made to all premises for the collection of house refuse, and the service has been fairly satisfactory, but it would be better if it could be arranged that each street should be visited on a specified day, which is not at present done. The Assistant Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council, in his report on the Sanitary condition and administration of the Parish of Fulham, remarks, with regard to the collection of refuse, that the "result generally seems to be satisfactory, and during my inspection I seldom noticed any accumulation of house refuse." The Vestry have now under their consideration a scheme for the erection of a "Dust Destructor,'' which if carried out will in my opinion be of distinct advantage to the parish. 43 PUBLIC MORTUARY. 173 bodies were removed to the Mortuary during the year and were admitted as follows:- At the request of the Coroner 145 Brought in by the Police 19 At the request of the Medical Officer of Health 9 173 Eight of the last being cases of infectious disease. Inquests were held on 164, and post-mortem examinations were made in 85 of the above cases. BAKEHOUSES. There are 77 bakehouses in Fulham, which have been regularly inspected during the year and have generally been found in a fairly satisfactory condition. Intimations were served in respect of eight bakehouses, and in one instance the owner was prosecuted on account of the dirty condition of the bakehouse, but as the nuisance had been remedied before the hearing of the summons, only a nominal penalty was inflicted. Underground Bakehouses. Allusion was made in last year's report to the fact that in new districts underground bakehouses are still being erected, and that legislation was needed to provide that no newly erected bakehouse should be permitted to be underground. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1895, which came into operation at the beginning of this year, provides for this, as Section 27 (3) enacts that "a place underground shall not be used as a bakehouse unless it is so used at the commencement 44 of this Act, and if any place is so used in contravention of this Act it shall be deemed to be a workshop not kept in conformity with the Act of 1878." SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. The licences of the undermentioned slaughter-houses were renewed in October last by the County Council, no objection to the renewal being raised by the Vestry. They are but little used, the parish being mainly supplied by the dead meat trade, and have always been found well kept. Situation. Licensee. 62, Melmoth Place T. H. Belcher. 603, King's Road H. S. Jones. 611, Fulham Road J. Cragg. 88 and 90, High Street E. and G. Kingston. 640, King's Road H. E. Shalders. 105, Hammersmith Road H. Boughton. COW-HOUSES. The licences of the following Cow-houses were renewed by the County Council in October, the renewal of the licences being unopposed. Average No.of Cows kept, Situation. Licensee. 36, Burlington Road E. Evans 5 2, Haldane Road W. Pettitt 15 42, Waterford Road Willison & Co. 4 28, Vanston Place R. Turvey 5 COMMON LODGING HOUSES. The following are the registered Common Lodging Houses in Fulham. Situation. Authorised No.of Lodgers. 541, King's Road 51 16, Stamford Road 15 38, Stamford Road 20 45 Two of these can hardly be considered Common Lodging Houses as they do not take in casual lodgers, but only receive men employed at certain nursery gardens in the neighbourhood, who are boarded as well as lodged and generally remain for lengthy periods. BY-LAWS UNDER PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. The By-laws made by the Vestry under Section 94, in respect of houses let iu lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, were amended by the Vestry, the limits of exemption, viz., 3s. 6d. a week for unfurnished rooms, and 5s. for furnished rooms, being raised to 6s. and 7s. 6d. respectively. The amended By-laws were allowed by the Local Government Board in November, and steps are now being taken to register houses under them. UNDERGROUND ROOMS. 25 notices in respect of underground rooms not complying with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, and found to be separately occupied, were served, and in one instance, the notice not having been complied with, proceedings were taken against the owner and the occupier. OVERCROWDING. 15 houses were certified as being overcrowded, and notices to abate the overcrowding were served on the persons responsible for it, and in one instance, the notice not having been complied with, proceedings were taken and an abatement order made. CERTIFICATES UNDER CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890 and 1891. Certificates for exemption from Inhabited House Duty in respect of 35 houses were refused. 46 ENQUIRY BY THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL AS TO THE SANITARY CONDITION AND ADMINISTRATION OF FULHAM. The Assistant Medical Officer to the London County Council, Dr. Young, made an enquiry on behalf of the Council, during the year, as to the sanitary condition and administration of Fulham. Dr. Young's report will be found in the appendix to this report. COMBINED DRAINAGE. A conference of Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, convened by the Holborn District Board of Works, met on four occasions at the Holborn Town Hall. The Bill to amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to drains and sewers, prepared by the London County Council was considered and some alterations suggested. The chief clauses of the Bill altered, was suggested by the conference, are the following:— I. In the construction of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same, the word "drain" shall be deemed to apply to, and Include the subject matters specified in the 250th section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and in the 112th section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, and also any drain, whether constructed before the first of January, 1856, or subsequently, which has not been approved as a sewer by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, or under Section 69 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and Section 45 of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862, or under Sections 47 and 48 of the latter Act. II. Any Local Authority may recover any expenses incurred by them in clearing, repairing, or replacing any drain, for draining any group or block of houses, from the owner or owners of any premises for the drainage of which such drain is or 47 may be used, in such proportions, if there be more than one such owner, as may be settled by the Surveyor of the Local Authority, or in case of dispute, by the London County Council. Any such expenses may be recovered summarily in the same manner as the expenses of making and paving new streets are authorised to be recovered under the Metropolis Management Acts. There is, however, but little chance of the Bill becoming law during the coming session, and meanwhile the Vestry will have to face considerable expenditure in re-laying defective combined drains, as there is a large number of houses in Fulham which are drained by a combined operation, without such combination having been ordered by the Vestry; consequently these drains are sewers within the meaning of the Metropolis Management Acts, and repairable by the Vestry. 48 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. The following houses were represented to the Sanitary Authority under the Act as being in a state so injurious or dangerous to health as to be unfit for human habitation:— Description of Premises. Number of Dwellings Action Taken. Subsequent Action. 1 to 15, St. George's sq. 15 Repaired by Owner 1, 2 and 3, Factory lane 3 „ „ 15, 16, 17 and 18, Caroline place 4 „ „ 68, High street 1 Closed by Magistrate's order Repaired and Re-opened 3b, 4b and 5b, Bagleys lane 3 Repaired by Owner 1 to 7, Garden row 7 Closed by Magistrate's order Demolished 14, Greyhound road 1 Repaired by Owner 32, Greyhound road 1 „ „ 53, Hammersmith road 1 Closed by Owner Demolished 63, Hammersmith road 1 „ „ „ 1, Distillery lane 1 Repaired by Owner 49 Description of Premises. Number of Dwellings Action Taken Subsequent Action. 2 to 6, Distillery lane 6 Closed by Magistrate's order with penalty of £ 1 in each case 7, Distillery lane 1 Closed by Magistrate's order with penalty of £1 Demolished 58, Star road 1 Repaired by Owner 46 DEMOLITION OF HOUSES UNDER THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. In June I represented to the Vestry, that in my opinion, the continuance of Nos.3, 4, 5, 6,7,8, 9 and 10, Caroline Place, which had been closed under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, since 1891, was dangerous or injurious to the health of the public or of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwelling-houses. The Vestry having resolved that it was expedient to order the demolition of these houses, notice of the resolution was served on the owners. Mr. R. Furber attended before the Vestry on behalf of the owners of the houses, who were mortgagees in possession, and stated that the property was now the subject of litigation in Chancery, owing to the bankruptcy ot the former owner, and contended that there was a technical objection to the notice served by the Vestry, but that he was willing, on behalf of his clients, to give an undertaking in writing to at once Board up the property and pull down the dangerous portions of the buildings to the satisfaction of the Survevor, if the Vestry would allow the question of demolition to stand over until the legal negotiations were concluded, and the request was acceded to by the Vestry. The following Table gives a summary of the action taken under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, in the last three years. Total number of Houses represented by the Medical Officer of Health as unfit for habitation. Number of Houses closed. demolisled or improved without Magisterial intervention. Number of Houses for which Closing Orders were granted. Closed. Demolished. Improved Total. Subsequently demolished. Subsequently improved and re-opened. Still closed Total. 175 9 10 73 92 11 64 8 83 50 51 SUPERVISION OF NEW PROPERTY In my last annual report I remarked that "the attention of the Vestry has more than once been called to the necessity for more supervision being exercised over new property At present the drains of new houses are always very carefully tested, but frequently, owing to the time of the Drainage Inspector being fully occupied, no inspection is made of the sanitary fittings, which subsequently are sometimes found not to have been constructed in accordance with the By-laws; and as the houses have generally changed hands, the new owner naturally feels aggrieved when called upon to make certain alterations, having purchased the house on the understanding that all the sanitary arrangements had been approved bv the Local Authority. In some instances even houses have been found to be occupied in inch an unfinished condition as to be quite unfit for human habitation. "No newly-erected house should be permitted to be occupied until not merely the drains, but all the sanitary appliances have been inspected and approved, and the Vestry should at once increase their staff, so that this may be carried out. The cases of "The Vestry v. Lowman," in the list of prosecutions under the Public Health Act, serve to illustrate these remarks, since those houses were let and occupied when quite unfit for habitation, as the drains were left open just beneath the windows, the water was not laid on, water-fittings were not provided, the yards were unpaved and undrained, in fact they were in a generally unfinished condition. The Vestry have since appointed an additional Drainage Inspector, whose duties are entirely connected with the supervision of the drainage and sanitary appliances of new houses, but what is really wanted to strengthen the hands of the Sanitary Authority, and to enable them to exercise proper control over new houses, is, that the bounty Council should have power to make a By-law: at a person shall not let or occupy any new dwelling-house until such dwelling-house shall, after examination have been certified by an officer of the Sanitary Authority 52 authorised to give such certificate, to be, in his opinion, in every respect fit for human habitation." This By-law has been adopted in several provincial towns, and has been confirmed by the Local Government Board. I brought this matter under the notice of the County Council, but have been informed that the Council appear to have no power to make a By-law of the nature referred to, but that the question of applying to Parliament for such power is under consideration. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The following samples were taken for analysis during the year:— Samples. Adulterated. Milk 95 10 Cocoa 4 1 Sugar 6 - Mustard 1 - Pepper 2 — Butter 17 3 Lard 2 - Coffee 6 1 Whisky 1 — Vinegar 2 — 136 15 Of the 95 samples of milk taken 10, or 10.5 per cent., were found to be adulterated, and were pronounced to be of inferior quality. In 1893, 20 per cent., and in 1894, 217 per cent. of the samples of milk taken were found to be adulterated. One sample was taken for every 814 of the population as compared with one for every 492 persons in London in 1894. It will again be noticed that the favourite form of sophistication was that of abstraction of fat, or in other words, that of selling skim milk as pure new milk. 53 Proceedings under Sale of Food and Drugs Act.

The respondent was served with a notice under Section ??? (2) of the Public Health Act, requiring him to make ??? alterations in a water-closet on premises of which he ??? the owner. By Section 41 (3) "any person who thinks himself aggrieved by any notice or act of a Sanitary Authority under that Section in relation to any water-closet ??? appeal to the County Council, whose decision shall be ???" The work not having been done complaint was made to ??? Magistrate by the Vestry, who contended that he had ??? jurisdiction to enquire into the validity of the notice, ??? that as the notice had been duly served, the work ??? not been done, and the owner had not appealed to the ??? Council, he was compelled to convict and fine the ??? by the provisions of Section 41 (2). The Magistrate decided that he had jurisdiction to ??? into the validity of the notice ; and that the ??? in the notice not being in accordance with the ???y-laws of the Countv Council, were void under Section ??? of the Public Health Act, and dismissed the summons ??? costs. Against this decision the Vestry appealed, contending ??? that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to enquire into ??? validity of the notice—("Vestry of St. James, Clerken???, v. Fearey, 24 Q. B. D. 703")—and secondly, that ??? if the Magistrate had that power the notice was good, ??? been made under Section 41 (2), and not under the ???-lavvs of the Countv Council, which had no application to J ' ???case of this kind. The Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the ???agistrate was right in deciding that the notice given by the vestry was void under Section 39 the Public Health Act, as not being in accordance with the By-laws made under that Section. It will be noticed that, with one exception, all the ???y-laws made by the County Council with respect ???ater-closets under Section 39 of the Public Health Act, 60 refer only to those constructed after the date of the confirmation of the By-laws, June 28th, 1893, and that the only By-law applying to closets constructed before that date is By-law 27: "The owner of any premises shall maintain in proper condition of repair every water-closet, and the proper accessories thereof belonging to such premises"; consequently as by Section 39 (3) any directions given by the Sanitary Authority "under this Act," must be in accordance with the By-laws, and so far as they are not so in accordance are void, any notice of the Sanitary Authority specifying structural alterations to closets in old houses is bad. For instance, the Sanitary Authority has no power to serve a notice requiring a "foul container closet" to be removed, but can only require it to be maintained in proper condition of repair. Exposure of a Person Suffering from Infectious Diseases. On January 3rd a notification was received that a child at 71, Fulham Palace Road, was suffering from Scarlatina, and on enquiries being made it was ascertained that the child, who had been staying with relatives, had been taken by train to Egham by her mother on that day, after she had been pronounced by the medical practitioner to be suffering from Scarlatina. The case was subsequently notified by a local practitioner to the Medical Officer of Health for Egham, who had been informed of the circumstance of the case. The Vestry, considering that gross and wilful recklessness whereby the health of many must necessarily have been endangered had been shown by the mother, whose only excuse was that she did not think the child had Scarlatina, instituted proceedings against her under the Public Health Act, and a penalty of £2 with 38s. cost was imposed at the West London Police Court. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. The following Table gives a record of the work done during the year by your Sanitary Officials. It is unnecessary to notice in detail the various improvements 61 effected, as in all cases where a house is inspected it is endeavoured to place it in every respect in a thoroughly sanitary condition. It will be noticed that a very We amount of work has been done in connection with defective drainage, no less than 662 houses having been re-drained during the year. Complaints received and attended to 1,160 Dwelling-houses inspected and reported on 2,430 Miscellaneous Inspection 1,540 Notices for Sanitary Improvements served:— Intimation 1,950 Statutory Notices 940 House drains reconstructed in accordance with the regulations of the Vestry 662 The appointment of an additional Inspector in June last has enabled more work to be done than has hitherto been possible, and a house-to-house inspection has been made of some small portion of the district. But this has not been done to the extent it should be, and it is not possible to do it even with the increased staff. To properly carry out the duties devolving upon them under the various Sanitary Acts, it is necessary that the Vestry should appoint a fifth Inspector, and even then there would be in Fulham only one Inspector to every 23,000 inhabitants, as compared with one to every 19,000 in London. I trust, therefore, that the Vestry will recognise the necessity of having a sanitary staff sufficiently strong to cope with the requirements of this rapidly growing district. In conclusion, I have again the pleasure of expressing pay satisfaction with the manner in which the Sanitary Clerk and the Sanitary Inspectors have performed their duties and would remind the Vestry that the large amount of beneficial work which has been accomplished is mainly due to the tact and energy shown by their Inspectors. I am, Your obedient Servant, J. CHARLES JACKSON. March 25th, 1896. appendix. Statistical Tables.

H Report of Dr. Young, Assistant Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council, on the Sanitary Condition and Administration of the Parish of Fulham. The sanitary district of Fulham is situated in the western part of the metropolitan area on the north bank of the river Thames. The course of the river here makes a considerable curve and forms the boundary of the district on the south.west, south, and south.east. On the northwest the boundary is formed by Hammersmith, and on the east and north.east by Chelsea and Kensington. The character of the soil of the district is practically the same throughout the area, and consists of gravel and sand overlying the London clav. During the recent construction of a sewer in the neighbourhood of Dawes Road the depth of the gravel at this part was found to be 27 feet. The area of Fulham is 1,701 acres, including 8 acres of water. The adjacent tidal water and foreshore is equal to an area of 156 acres. Until the year 1886, Hammersmith and Fulham together formed one sanitary district under the jurisdiction of the Fulham Board of Works. By the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1885, this Board was dissolved, and the parish of Fulham was constituted a separate sanitary district under the control of the Vestry of Fulham as the local authority. The rateable value of the district at the present time is £511,738. I have extracted from the annual reports of the Vestry the rateable values at different periods since 1861, which show the large increase thai has taken place in this respect since that date. The figures are as follows:— 1861 £58,296 1881 £190,136 1871 100,121 1891 426,551 Under the Equalisation of Rates (London) Act, 1894, the amount payable to Fulham from the Equalisation fund for the half.year ending September, 1895, amounted to £4,299 0s. 8d., and for the previous half. year to £4,402 is. 6d., which is equivalent to the production of a rate in Fulham of nearly 4d. in the £1 for the whole year For statistical purposes the sanitary area of Fulham forms one of the sub.districts of the registration district of Fulham, which includes three sub.districts, namely, Fulham, St. Peter, Hammersmith, and St. Paul, Hammersith. The census returns as to the population and number of inhabited houses in the sub.district of Fulham show that a marked change has 104 been taking place during the last thirty years. The following Table gives the figures obtained at each census since 1861 — Population, Houses (inhabited). 1861 15,539 2,481 1871 23,350 3,469 1881 42,900 5.833 1891 91,639 12,896 From these it is seen that there has been a very rapid increase in the population, and especially since the year 1871, for whereas between 1861.71 there was an increase of 50 per cent., between 1871.81 the increase was equal to about 83 per cent, of the population, and during the intcr.censal period of 1881.91 the population more than doubled itself. This increase is no doubt largely due to the extensive building of houses in the district, and the immigration of persons from the more central parts of the metropolis. At the date of the ordnance survey of London some thirty years ago the district of Fulham consisted of four villages, namely, Fulham, North End, Parsons Green, and Walham, separated by land used chiefly for agricultural purposes; at the present time the greater part of this area, with the exception of some 500 acres, for the most part situated along the bank of the river, has been built over, and building operations are still being carried on. During the period which has elapsed since the census was taken in 1891, considerable increase in the number of houses and of residents has continued to take place, though there is reason to believe that the rate of increase has not been quite so great as during the period 1881.91. The density ot the population in rulham, as measured by the average number of inhabitants per acre and per inhabited house in the census year 1891 and previous censuses, was as follows :— • Per acre. Per inhabited house. 1861 9 6.2 1871 14 6.7 1881 25 7.3 1891 54 7.1 In the registration County of London in 1891 there was an average of 56 persons to each acre, and 7.7 persons per inhabited house. 105 The proportion of the population living in one and in two rooms was in 1891 less than m the other districts of London except Camberwell Greenwich, Hackney, Hampstead, Lewisham, Plumstead and Wands.! worth. he number of persons living in one room was greater, and in two rooms less than in Battersea. In the last censes return of the population of Fulham it is shown that the total number of inhabitants, viz., 91,639, consisted of 42,861 males or 46.8 per cent., and 48,778 females or 53.2 per cent. The proportion which obtained in London was 47.3 per cent. males and 52.7 per cent. females. ' The following figures give the proportion of persons of each sex at different age periods. The figures for London generally are also given :— 0. 5. 10. 15. 20. 25. 35. 45. 55. 65. 75 and upwards. Fulham— Males 7.12 6.15 4.94 3.84 3.76 8.19 6.08 3.72 1.76 0.91 0.30 Females 7.06 6.57 5.17 4. 49 5.11 9.75 6.69 4.09 2.53 1.46 0.57 London— Males 5.92 5.36 4.90 4.69 4.61 7.92 5.85 4.11 2.35 1.20 0.37 Females 5.99 5.42 4.99 5.21 5.56 9.11 6.49 4.64 2.92 1.72 0.69 A marked difference in the constitution of these two populations is the excess of persons under 15 years and between the ages 25.45 in Fulham. The relatively greater proportion of persons at these ages is probably due to newly.married persons, and persons with young families having taken up their abode in Fulham, consequent upon the large number of houses which have been built there of late years. The high birth.rate which prevails in Fulham no doubt largely accounts for the excess of persons under 15 years, but the presence of the Western Fever Hospital in the district may to a small extent have some effect. In the next Table are given the birth and death-rates for Fulham and London respectively. The rates for Fulham have been calculated upon the number of deaths occurring in the parish after the correction for Jackson the non-residents. These figures have been supplied by Dr. Jackson, the Medical Officer of Health of Fulham. The rates from all causes so obtained, as well generally have been further corrected for age and sex distribution by the factor riven by the Council's Medical Officer in his annual report. 106 Fulham.

(c)Roof of back addition building defective, window defective and work dilapidated, rear brickwork defective . (d)Fore-cout and yard unpaved, wall of ground floor front and back room very damp , rear brickwork defective, pointing defective ,rear doorway framewook dilapidated In another part of the district houses of somewhat older date were seen which were of the same character as the above, but in these owing to action on the part of the sanitary authority, defects have been rectified and alterations effected, and most of the houses at the time of my visit were in a fair state of repair. During the course of my inspection of the district I visited 406 dwellings, and at 283 of them I found one or more defects existing. I made notes of the following: — Defective roofs In the case of 33 houses. Infective drains or drain inlets 26 Defective water-closets or foul pans„ 102 " Defective paving of yards and forecourts „ 92 Defective domestic water cisterns,, 36 „ Defective or absence of dustbins„ 100 „ Dirty or dilapidated walls and defective flooring „ 100 „ Damp walls ,, 86 „ Defective brickwork „ 30 „ Defective stack pipes and gutterings„ 17 „ Accumulations of house refuse „ 4 „ Generally speaking I found drain inlets to be well trapped, and water-closets provided with separate cisterns for flushing purposes. In many houses the drains were ventilated, properly trapped and disconnected from the sewers, though in a few cases it was noticed that ventilation of the soil pipe had been effected by means of a rain-water stack pipe in such a way as to be liable to cause nuisance, owing to the proximity of its upper end to an adjoining window. With reference to the existence of overcrowding in dwellings, instances were not wanting where this was found to exist as judged by the standard adopted in the model by-laws of the Local Government Board. These by-laws require that every room used both as day and sleeping room shall be of such cubic capacity as to allow 400 cubic feet, and every room used solely for sleeping, 300 cubic feet per person, two children under ten years of age being regarded as equivalent to one adult. The following are notes which I made in connection with this subject during my inspections:— A top floor room of about 1,120 cubic feet, occupied as a living room by a family consisting of father, mother, one adult , athere children. A room of about 988 cubic feet, used both for sleep,ng and living by a family of father, mother and three children. children A family, consisting of father, mother, one adult child, and five children occupying three small rooms, all sleep m one room of about 864 cubic teet. This house was in a very defective condition. separate families. In live and sleep. House dirty throughout, 108 Three rooms occupied by a family consisting of father, mother, four children over ten years, and three under that age. Two rooms were occupied as bedrooms, one by the father and mother and one child, the other by the rest of the family. The size of this room was about 1,080 cubic feet. There are four licensed cowsheds and six licensed slaughter-houses in Fulham. At the time of my visit to these premises 1 found that they were in a good state of repair, and that the by-laws and regulations were duly observed. The milk shops which were inspected were also found to be well kept, and with few exception? the utensils were in a cleanly condition. There are no registered offensive businesses in the district. I also inspected thirty-four bakehouses. The majority of these were situated in the basement of the premises, either partially or wholly below the level of the adjoining roadway. In some cases these were bakehouses which had only recently been constructed, and the means of light and ventilation were, generally speaking, fairly good. As regards seven bakehouses, however, the provisions for ventilation did not appear to me to be adequate. Cleanliness was well observed in each, and there is evidence that periodical limewashing of the walls is enforced by the sanitary authority. In only a few instances did I notice a drain inlet situated inside the bakehouse. In all these cases the inlet was fitted with a proper trap. I was unable to obtain a list of the workshops which there are in the district, as it appears to have been impossible for the existing sanitary staff to devote any special attention in carrying out the provisions of the Factory and Workshops' Act. Dr. Jackson, the Medical Officer of Health, however, accompanied me to some premises, the addresses of which had been supplied to him as workshops within the meaning of the Act. These were found to be mostly private houses at which one or more of the family worked but did not employ labour, and a few were large millinery establishments. As regards these little fault was to be found; in the absence of any definite information as to the number and character of workshops which there are in the district, it is impossible to form an opinion as to their needs. There are three registered common lodging-houses in Fulham; these comply with the requirements of the Acts and regulations respecting such premises. Two of the houses differ in character from the ordinary common lodging-houses in that the keepers, who reside on the premises, do not take in casual lodgers; they receive only men employed at certain nursery gardens in the neighbourhood, who are recommended by the proprietor. These lodgers are boarded as well as lodged, and often remain for lengthy periods. The Vestry have provided a mortuary in connection with a coroner's court, for the use of the parish. The building contains two mortuary chambers and a post-mortem room. I extract from the annual reports of the Medical Officer of Health of the district the following information relating to the use of the mortuary during the last two years. During 1893. 130 bodies were brought to the mortuary, of which twelve were brought at the request of the Medical Officer of Health, six being cases 109 of infectious disease. During 1894, 123 bodies were removed to the mortuary, five at the request of the Medical Officer of Health four being cases of infectious disease. The removal of house refuse and the scavening of the streets is carried out by the Vestry. As regards the house refuse ,it is the costum to have every house called at once each week and in order that the collection shall be made periodically, the parish has been divided into six sub-districts, each of which is visited upon a fixed day. The result appears to be generally satisfactory, and during the course of my insection I seldom noticed any accumulations of house refuse. The 1 erase is taken to the Vestry's wharf on the river, and there at once loaded into barges and removed. The Vestry have not made provision for undertaking the disinfection of articles of clothing, bedding, etc., after the occurrence of infectious disease, but have arranged with a contractor in the district for this purpose. By the terms of this contract, inquiry is made twice daily at the Vestry Hall on behalf of the contractor for the purpose of ascertaining the occurrence of cases of infectious disease concerning which disinfection is required. The articles are removed from and returned to the houses in separate vans. The disinfection is effected by steam. The disinfection of rooms is carried out by an official in the employ of the Vestry. The Vestry have not up to the present time provided a shelter for the use of the district, under section 60 Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which requires that every sanitary authority shall provide shelter for use of persons during the period necessary for the disinfection of their dwellings. The water supply for the parish of Fulham is supplied partly by the Chelsea and partly by the West Middlesex Water Works Companies. The Sanitary staff of the Vestry consists at the present time of:— A Medical Officer of Health. Four Sanitary Inspectors. One Assistant for Disinfection. A Sanitary Clerk. The Medical Officer of Health is not allowed to engage in private practice. The Sanitary staff is under his control, and he attends at the offices of the Vestry daily to supervise the work of the department. The Inspectors have districts allotted to them, and each performs in his allotted district all duties arising under the Public Health Acts and the Food and Drugs Act. They attend at the offices daily in the morning to carry out certain clerical duties, such as preparing the intimation notices, and also to see builders and others who may seek advice. They also attend in the afternoon if necessary. The Disinfection Assistant is employed in carrying out the disinfection of rooms in which cases of infectious diseases have occurred. The Clerk devotes his time to keeping the register of complaints, the inspection book which contains a record of the conditions found to exist in all premises visited by the Inspectors, and of the action taken in each case, the register of infectious disease occurring in the district. I 10 the register of samples taken under the Food and Drugs Act, and the mortuary and correspondence registers. He also makes out the statutory notices, and notices which are sent to the School Board, the Public Library, and the master of the house, in connection with the occurrence of infectious disease. Me also keeps a record of the returns forwarded by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, of the fees paid to medical practitioners for notification returns of houses certified by the sanitary authority as being provided with a proper and sufficient supply of water, and of certificates granted under the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. Another register has recently been commenced of all the houses in the district, with a view to a record being kept of all cases of infectious disease, and of deaths from other diseases, which occur in each house in the district. The sanitary authority for the district is the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. There is a Sanitary Committee for the special consideration of matters arising in connection with the work of the Public Health Department, consisting of all the members of the Vestry, but no powers under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are delegated to this committee by the Vestry. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1831, the sanitary authorities in the Metropolis must make and enforce by-laws in respect to the following matters:— (1) The prevention of particular nuisances. (2) The keeping of water-closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action. (3) The cleansing of receptacles used for storing water likely to be used for drinking purposes. (4) Houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The Vestry of Fulham have made by-laws on these subjects, which have been confirmed by the Local Government Board. The by-laws are based on the model by-laws, and are similar to those which have been made and are now in force in most districts in the metropolis. As regards the amount of rental which is considered sufficient to exempt houses from the operation of by-laws which relate to houses let in lodgings, this is not the same in all parts of London. In the case of Fulham, by-laws have recently been confirmed by the Local Government Board giving the sanitary authority power to register all unfurnished lodgings of no greater rental than 6s. a week, and all furnished lodgings which do not exceed a rental of 7s. 6d. a week. These by-laws require the same amount of cubic space as the model by-laws of the Local Government Board already referred to, namely, 400 cubic feet for each person in rooms used both for living and sleeping purposes, and 300 cubic feet in those used for sleeping only, two children under ten years being regarded as equivalent to one adult. No houses had been registered at the time of my inspection. 111 A considerable amount of work has been carried out by the sanitary authority under the powers conferred on them by the Public Health (London) Act, and under the Housing of the Working Classes Act as regards houses unfit for human habitation. I find from the reports of the Medical Officer of Health for the years 1893 and 1894 that under the last-Mentioned Act, thirty-nine and ninety houses respectively were certified by him as being unfit for human habitation. Of these houses eleven were demolished, and the remainder were either closed by the owners or by a magistrate's order. During my inspection 1 had opportunities of seeing premises in which drainage improvements were being effected owing to action by the sanitary authority ; in all such cases the requirements of the Vestry appeared to be comprehensive, including ventilation and disconnection, and the provision of inspection chambers in the course of the system of drains. All drains, whether in newlybuilt houses or after re-construction, are now subjected to a water test before being passed as satisfactory. The work thus carried on is as a rule limited to the case of premises which have been brought to the notice of the sanitary authority by a complaint, or by the occurrence of infectious disease. Some parts of the district, however, known to require periodical visits are thus treated, but it has not been possible to undertake a systematic house-to-house inspection of the whole district. The results of this inquiry into the sanitary condition of Fulham may be summed up as follows:— (1) The general death-rates for the last four years have been less than in London generally, but the infantile death-rates and the zymotic death-rates have been greater in Fulham. The birthrate, which in 1891 showed a marked excess over London, has decreased. (2) Much work has been carried out by the health department for the remedying of insanitary conditions, but in more than twothirds of the houses visited by me defective conditions were found to exist. (3) Systematic house-to-house inspection has not been undertaken, owing to the time of the existing staff being fully occupied. (4) No sufficient steps have been taken to carry out the provision of the Factory and Workshops Act. (5) No shelter for the provision of families during the disinfection of their rooms has been provided. (6) The enforcement by the Vestry of the by-laws relating to houses let in lodgings will cause a considerable increase in the duties of the Sanitary Inspectors and Clerk. (7) Vestry have not provided themselves with proper apparatus for disinfection beyond arranging with a contractor. 112 These facts lead to the conclusion that, in order that the duties devolving upon the Public Health Department may be efficiently carried out, the Vestry should take steps to increase their staff. The appointment of another Inspector, making a total of five for the district, would probably at the present time be sufficient, though, in a district which is increasing so rapidly as Fulham, a further increase at no distant date may possibly be necessary. Additional clerical assistance is also needed. The Vestry should, without further delay, provide a shelter for the use of persons during the disinfection of their rooms. C. W. F. YOUNG, Assistant Medical Officer of Health. Town Hall, Fulham, S.W. Gentlemen, March 16th, 1896. REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT MEDICAL OFFICER TO THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. The report of Dr. Young, one of the Assistant Medical Officers to the London County Council, on the Sanitary Condition Administration of the Parish of Fulham, has been referred by the Committee to me for my observations. The first portion of the report—which deals with the situation, area, rateable value, population, the density and age and sex constitution of the population of the parish-requires no comment, as the facts and figures have been given in my reports. With regard to the death-rates given, with which you are also familiar, it will be noticed that in 1894, as well as in the other years referred to, the corrected death-rate was lower, though only slightly so, in Fulham than in London. Dr. Young remarks that the zymotic death-rate of Fulham is higher than that of London, but in comparing the zymotic death-rates, the age constitution of the districts must, as I have pointed out, be taken into account, as the most prevalent of the seven principal zymotic diseases are mainly fatal to young children; in fact, upwards of 90 per cent. of the deaths from these diseases are of children under the age of 15 years, so that a district with a population containing a large proportion of children will, other things being equal, have a higher zymotic death-rate than a district with a population containing a small proportion of children. The proportion of children under 15 years of age amounts in Fulham to 36.6 per cent. of the population, and in London to only 32.4, and taking this difference into consideration it will be found that the corrected zymotic death-rate for Fulham is only 5 per cent. higher than that of London, while the uncorrected zymotic death-rate is no less than 16 per cent. higher. In making these calculations, I have corrected an error in the zymotic death-rate for 1891, as given in the report, which should be 2.3 instead of 3.1. The infantile mortality which, as Dr. Young points out, is also higher than that of London, is adversely affected by the fact that the proportion of illegitimate to legitimate births is higher in Fulham than in London, for, as is well known, the mortality of illegitimate is more than double that of children born in wedlock, though this factor does not by any means entirely account for the difference in the infantile mortality of London and Fulham. On the other hand, the death-rate of children betwen the ages of 1 and 5, an important sanitary test, is lower in Fulham than in London. The next matter dealt with by Dr. Young is the general structure and conditions of the houses in Fulham, and this is perhaps the most important feature in the report. Dr. Young says:—"A marked feature which attracted attention in this district is the inferior character of the building which has taken place in some parts. Houses which I found 114 had only been built within recent years were already becoming defective, owing apparently to the inferior quality of material used in their construction and to inferior workmanship," and he then gives some typical examples. As to the absolute correctness of these remarks there can be no question, as most of the members of the Committee are well aware. In fact it may be said that a very large proportion of the sanitary defects in Fulham are due to the original faulty construction of the houses. And for this state of things it must be borne in mind the Sanitary Authority in Fulham are in no way responsible, as it is due to the way in which the Building Act has been administered, formerly by the Metropolitan Board of Works and of late years by the London County Council. I regret, too, to have to say that even with the more stringent Building Act of 1894 things are now but little better; at the present moment houses are being erected in Fulham in such a manner that it is almost certain that in a very few years they will be in a ruinous condition, and I have reported to the Council some recent violations of the Building Act in respect of open space at the rear of houses, a point which is also alluded to by Dr. Young as having been neglected in the past. This report of the Council's own officer is a strong argument in favour of the transfer of many of the powers possessed by the London County Council under the Building Act to the Local Authority, and I would strongly urge the Vestry to endeavour to secure the transfer of these powers, which was, I believe, recommended by the recent Conference of Local Authorities, seeing how they are suffering from the shortcomings of the Central Authority who now sit in judgment on them. Dr. Young next gives a list of the defects he found in the houses he visited, which shows the necessity for what has often been pressed upon the Vestry, viz., house-to-house inspection. I may say that since Dr. Young's visit a house-to-house inspection of some small portions of the parish has been effected, but not to the extent it should be done. With respect to the overcrowding mentioned by Dr. Young, as I have already reported, it is evident from the census returns that there is a good deal of overcrowding in the parish, but it escapes notice as the staff of inspection is too small to undertake a systematic examination, even of the very poor property, which is so eminently desirable. I may say, however, that overcrowding is a very difficult matter to deal with, as, if abated in one house it probably recurs in another, and sometimes, unfortunately, it is a question either of a family living under overcrowded conditions or of having no roof over their heads. I hope, however, when I am able to get all the tenement houses registered this evil will be able to be dealt with. With respect to the cowsheds, slaughter-houses, milk-shops and bakehouses, I need say nothing, as Dr. Young reports favourably of them. As to workshops some little work has been done of late, but not to the extent I could wish. The portion of the report dealing with common lodging-houses, the mortuary, and the removal of refuse, calls for no remarks. With respect to the disinfection I have more than once reported to the Vestry on the question, the last occasion being of recent date, and as the Vestry are about to deal with the question of refuse 115 destruction and are expecting a report from an Engineer on the matter, it is, I think a favourable time to consider the advisability of erecting disinfecting plant in connection with a destructor, as probably there would be economy both in the cost of erection and in the subsequent working if the two were carried out in conjunction. In the same scheme, too, provision should be made for a "shelter" for the use of persons during the period necessary for the disinfection of their dwellings, is required by the Public Health (London) Act. Dr. Wing's remarks on the water supply, the sanitary staff and the By-laws, deal with matters which are perfectly familiar to the Committee and need not be gone into. The final portion of Dr. Young's report is of a nature that must be satisfactory to the Vestry, bearing testimony as it does to the amount of work accomplished by the Sanitary Authority and also to the thoroughness with which the work is done. I have briefly touched upon the main features of the report, and to sum up I might say that all the facts mentioned have, at various times, been brought under your notice, and that, looking at it as a whole, the report cannot be regarded as entirely unsatisfactory. With regard to the recommendations of Dr. Young, I have already dealt with the question of disinfection and the provision of a shelter, and i would urge the Vestry to carry out his recommendation to appoint another Inspector. Although a great deal has been accomplished, an immense amount remains to be done, and, unfortunately, from the nature of the buildings, which has been alluded to, and the character of many of the residents, a large proportion of the property requires frequent and regular inspection, which cannot be, with the present staff, undertaken. I might mention that even with an additional Inspector the proportion of persons and houses to each Inspector would still be considerably over that obtaining in London and in other large towns in England, the figures being:— Houses. Persons. London 2556 18787 15 Large Towns 2700 15000 Fulham, with 5 Inspectors 3000 23000 If another Inspector were appointed, a house-to-house inspection of the parish could be proceeded with more vigorously, steps could be taken to register all the tenement houses and secure the enforcement of the By-laws made in their respect, and the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Acts could also be carried out. I trust, therefore, the Vestry will see the necessity of appointing another Inspector, so that the various Acts for the administration of which they as the Sanitary Authority are responsible may be efficiently carried out, which would undoubtedly be in every way of benefit to the parish. I am, Yours obediently, J. CHAS. JACKSON, To the Chairman and Members, Sanitary Committee.
