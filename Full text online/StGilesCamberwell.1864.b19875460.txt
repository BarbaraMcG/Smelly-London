BILLING AND SON, COTTAGE GREEN, 1865 NINTH ANNUAL REPORT of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Griles, Camberwell. In conformity with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Vestry of the said Parish submit to the Parishioners a statement of their proceedings in the execution of the various powers vested in them. And an Account of their Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending the 25th March, 1865. SURVEYOR'S REPORT 1804-5. To the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, I beg to present to you the particulars of Works, and other matters which have engaged the attention of the Vestry during the financial year ending 25th March last, so far as they are connected with the department under my direction. GENERAL PURPOSES. HIGHWAYS. The general repairs of Roads and Footpaths 4 which are dedicated to the use of the public, and under the control of the Vestry, do not require any special reference, except that they afford me opportunity to explain an expression in my Report of last year, viz.:—"That their condition is such as merits your satisfaction." Exception has been taken to this paragraph, but when I explain that the exception referred more particularly to those Roads and Footpaths not yet under my supervision, (but still I admit very much needing that control,) the difference of opinion is accounted for. My early Reports will on perusal shew my opinion on this point, and I may claim that no exertion on my part, or fear of additional labor of supervision has prevented me urging the speedy taking to all undedicated Roads and Paths so soon as circumstances will admit The subjoined list of "New Roads" repaired during the past year, and others in hand, as well as the large amount of Kirbing, (in extent about 20,000 feet annually,) executed in the several "Wards will testify to the general improvement in the Highways of the Parish The list would have been considerably increased (as regards New Roads) but for the anticipated Sewers "Works, which for the present prevent them being repaired and converted into Public Roads, but you may depend that I shall with all possible 5 speed add to the number of these much needed improvements. New Paving Works have been executed in the Old Kent Road, from Cooper's Road to the Canal Bridge, and in High Street, Peckham (South side) from Eye Lane to Albert Road. Some of the best of the Old Paving from these Roads was re-used in Regent Street, Southampton street. I refer to this from a desire that the Vestry should inform itself of the manifest improvement which the above Work effected in the Footways of this Street, affording a striking proof of the efficiency (and ultimate economy) of Flag Paving for lower class localities, well as for the Main Public Thoroughfares of the Parish. NEW STREETS. The New Streets before referred to as having been repaired under the provisions of the Metropolitan Local Management Amendment Act, during the last Twelve Months, are as follow:— 6 Length. Ma-whey road, Old Kent road 350 yards. Emily road ditto „ Ossory road ditto 10 „ Lyndhurst grove, Peckham 235 „ Talfourd road ditto 510 „ Crab Tree Shot road ditto 450 „ Willow Brook road ditto 200 „ Basing road, ditto 370 „ Alpha street, Choumert road, Rye lane 130 „ Edmund street, Camberwell 55 „ I may here remark that the above list would have been materially extended but for the prohibition before referred to, caused by the construction of the "Main Local Sewerage" Works as explained in last year's Report, (p. 6.) STREETS, RE-NUMBERING. The Thoroughfares in this Parish which have received this necessary consideration, are Camberwell Green and Addington Square; several 7 other Roads and Streets have been submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works, but I believe the number of similar applications from other parts of the Metropolis, has as yet pevented that Board from giving the necessary attention thereto. RAILWAYS. Plans have been deposited by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway ("additional powers.") This deposit refers to a Line authorized in the last Session of Parliament, (see last Report page 8,) for the purpose of a deviation of the intended alteration of Half Moon Lane, near Red Post Hill, which alteration will be a decided improvement to that first proposed and sanctioned Plans and particulars of which diversion I have already submitted to the Vestry. Another deposition, by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Company (at Albert Road, 8 Peckham) affects this Public Thoroughfare, only by a widening of the present Bridge, near Fairmead "Villas, and has for its object a Junction with the adjacent Line belonging to the London and Brighton Company. This also has been reported upon by me to the Vestry. Powers are also sought to connect the series of Lines belonging to the Brighton Company, and passing through this Parish, with the Metropolitan and South London Railway, which proposes to utilize the Thames Tunnel as a means of Junction with the lines N. and S. of the Thames. LIGHTING. The number of Public Lamps of this Parish, is as follows:— No. Those supplied by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, are 1326 Ditto Phænix Gas Company 71 Ditto Crystal Palace Gas Company 64 Total 1461 9  No. Additional Lamps erected during the last Twelve months 80 Removals ditto 86 SEWERS. The Sewers Works executed by and under the direction of the Vestry during the past year, are as follows:— BRICK SEWERS. PIPE SEWERS. 14,556 Feet. 20,317 feet Total 34,873 feet, or 6½ miles. I beg to append a list of Roads and Streets included in the above lengths of Sewers, viz.:— Cooper's Road, Old Kent Road Emily Road, ditto 10 Mawbey Road, Old Kent Road Grove Lane Champion Grove College Street Fowler Street Avenue Road Dagmar Road (part of) Bells Garden Road, Peckham (part of) Lyndhurst Road (part of) Cow Lane Albert Road (part of) South Street, Rye Lane Alpha Street ditto Choumert Road Choumert Grove Elm Grove St. Mary's Road (part of) Cemetery Road ditto Philip Road, Peckham Rye Nunhead Grove Lordship Lane (part of) 11 Nuffield Road, Lordship Lane Frogley Road, ditto Lapse Lane, Forest Hill Dulwich Common Dulwich Village Wood Crescent Road Sydenham Common (at rear of) from Sydenham Hill to Crystal Palace. In the foregoing list are comprised all the Works for which the Loan (No. 1) of £8000 was raised. HOUSE DRAINAGE. No. of Houses permanently Drained. No. of Houses temporarily Drained. 459 199 Total 658 Houses. 12 LOCAL SEWERAGE. In the foregoing list are included most of the Sewers Works at all urgent) on the High Level, the remainder can be executed as necessity arises. As regards the Low Level Local Sewerage, my last year's Report notified that the Plan was under consideration, and without encroaching upon the information due to the current years Report, I may remind the Vestry that this Plan has been prepared and sanctioned, and active measures taken to carry out some of the most urgent Works for the immediate relief of the depressed portion of the Parish. Your approbation of the matters referred to in the foregoing Report having been so continuously and kindly afforded me, as to render my share of the great Works in which we are engaged, a most satisfactory occupation, I feel I ought to tender you my sincere appreciation of your confidence, and I venture to express a hope for its continuance to enable me to develope further improvements of 13 which the Parish is susceptible, and which its increasing population and growing importance demand. Your faithful and obedient Servant, J. C. REYNOLDS, Surveyor. Office of Works, Wells Street, Southampton Street, Camberwell. June 24th, 1865. 1864-5. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH'S ANNUAL REPORT, FOR 1864. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, The year 1864 may be regarded as having been generally an unhealthy year. The death-rates of London and of its several groups of districts were higher than they had been for ten years previously; and the epidemic of typhus fever, which at the end of 1864 had prevailed for three years in London, caused during that year more deaths than it had done during either 1862 or 1863; moreover there was an increased mortality from hooping cough, measles and diarrhoea, and especially from bronchial and pulmonary affections. The death-rates in 1864 were, according to the Registrar General:—for the whole of London 2.645 per cent., for the Western group of districts 2.485, for the Northern group 2.532, for the Central group 2.901, for the Eastern group 2.809 and for the Southern group 2.530 per cent. Deaths from hooping cough increased from 2229 in 1863, to 2386 in 1864: and (still comparing the former with the latter year) deaths from measles rose from 1698 to 2750, deaths from diarrhoea from 2448 to 2861, and deaths from pulmonary affections from 6049 to 8666. Deaths from fever, which were 3635 in 1862, and 2892 in 1863, amounted to 3689 in 1864. It should be added however that other zymotic diseases diminished in severity; that deaths from diphtheria fell from 724 in 18 1863, to 564 in 1864, deaths from scarlet fever from 5075 to 3242, and deaths from small-pox from 2012 to 537. It will be observed that the rate of mortality was lower in the Southern districts of London than in any other districts except the Western, and that the difference between the Southern and the Western districts was in this respect exceedingly small; it will be observed also that the fever mortality of the Southern districts was less than the fever mortality of the Northern and of the Eastern districts, but higher than that of the Central and of the Western districts. In the parish of Camberwell, as in other parts of London, the mortality of 1864 was greater than that of 1863, or indeed than that of any other year since the Metropolis Local Management Act came into operation. (Tables I, II, III, V & VI.) In 1863, 1731 deaths were registered in the parish, in 1864 the registered deaths amounted to 1843; there was therefore during that year an increase of 112 deaths. In the sub-districts also there was generally an increase; the total number of deaths registered for Dulwich was 24 (an increase of 2 on the number registered in the previous year); the total registered for the sub-district of Camberwell was 632 (an increase of 72); the total registered for Peckham was 673 (a diminution of 26); and the total registered for St. George's was 514 (an increase of 64). But of the 632 deaths ascribed to Camberwell proper, 123 occurred in the Workhouse and 73 in the Lunatic asylums. These however belong clearly no more to this sub-district than to the other sub-districts of the parish, and should therefore, for purposes of comparison, be distributed proportionately among them. If such a distribution be made,* the year's mortality becomes, for * This distribution has been made by dividing the deaths occurring in the Workhouse and Asylums among the sub-distriets, in proportion to the number of deaths (exclusive of these) returned from each. 19 Dulwich 27, for Camberwell 488, for Peckham 753 and for St. George's 575; and the difference between this corrected mortality for the year 1864, and the similarly corrected mortality for 1863, becomes for Dulwich an increase of 3 deaths, for Camberwell an increase of 66, for Peckham a decrease of 10 and for St. George's an increase of 84. There is no doubt however that the population of Camberwell has increased considerably between the middle of 1863 and the middle of 1864; and relatively far more considerably than that of either London as a whole, or that of any one of its five groups of districts. This is shewn partly by the experience of former years; partly by the common knowledge we possess with regard to the rapid increase of houses, especially of late, in most parts of the parish; and in a remarkable way by the rapid increase in the number of births. From 1857 (of which year I first have returns of births), the number of children born has regularly increased year by year, and latterly this increase has been very rapid. There were 150 more children born in the parish in 1863 than there were in 1862, and 344 more in 1864 than there were in 1863. (Tables IV & VII.) This increase in the number of births appears all the more remarkable, if it be compared with the increase during a corresponding period for the whole of London. For London, the birth-rate of 1864 shewed an increase of about .2 per cent. only over that of 1863; for Camberwell there was an increase in the birth-rate of 13-0 per cent. Cut the relative amount of increase varied considerably in the several sub-districts of the parish:— in Dulwich the births rose from 46 to 53, in Camberwell from 698 to 774, in Peckham from 1087 to 1156 and in St. George's from 807 to 999; the rate of increase being for Dulwich 15.2 per cent.. for Camberwell 10.9, for Peckham 6.3 and for St. George's 23.8. Now, doubtless, some portion of this great 20 increase in the number of births in Camberwell may be due to exceptional circumstances in regard to the population,* some portion to mere accident, but the greater part of is must certainly be due to mere though considerable increase of adult or child-producing population. In my last report, as in former reports, I explained how difficult it is to estimate the population of this parish and of its several sub-divisions; and in my last report I gave in proof of this three estimates founded on different data. I will give three similar estimates now, and the death-rates calculated according to these estimates. 1st.—If the people of Camberwell and of its sub-districts have since 1861 increased at the same annual rate† as these of the whole of South London increased between the census years 1851 and 1861, the population of Camberwell was in the midled of 1864 76,979, that of Dulwich was 1856, that of Camberwell proper 22,933, that of Peckham 30,296, that of St. George's 21,894; and the death-rates were for the whole parish 2.39 per cent., for Dulwich 1.4, for Camberwell 2.13, for Peckham 2.48 and for St.George's 2.63. 2nd.—If the parish and its component parts increased according to their own respective rates ‡ of increase during the ten years, 1851-61, the population of the parish amounted in the middle of the year to about 78,637, that of Dulwich to about 1754, that of Camberwell to about 22,684, that of Peckham to about 32,221, that of St. George's to about 22,202; and the * Such as the influx into the parish of a disproportionately large number of young newly married persons, attracted hither by the erection of new houses in new districts. † Viz. at the annual rate of 2.28 per cent. ‡ Increase of parish 30.77 per cent. per decenniad, of Dulwich 5.57, of Camberwell 20.04, of Peckham 44.69, of St. George's 28.29. 21 death-rates become respectively 2.34, 1.54, 2.15, 2.34 and 2.59. 3rd.—But if the population be estimated from the births (and the Registrar General has shewn that as a rule the mean birth-rate of England is 3.318 per cent. of the population,) the calculated population becomes for the whole parish 89,873, for Dulwich 1597, for Camberwell 23,327, for Peckham 34,840 and for St. George's 30,109; and the death-rates became respectively 2.05, 1.69, 2.09, 2.16 and 1.91. Now I can scarcely doubt that the first of the above estimates, of the population of the whole parish is considerably below the truth that the last is considerably above the truth. I believe also that the second estimate is a good deal below the actual number of the population. But even if that estimate be adopted, it will be observed that the parochial death-rate founded upon it is considerably below that of London, and that of any of the groups of districts into which the Registrar General divides London. As regards the sub-districts of the parish, I have no doubt that the first and second estimates are very wide indeed of the truth; for every thing shews that even if the parish as a whole have increased with some kind of uniformity of increase, the parts of the parish have increased irregularly and by fits and starts as it were. I have reason to believe that these estimates are especially misleading as regards the sub-district of St. George's, and that during 1864 there has been an unprecedently large influx of population into it. On the whole, I have no hesitation in affirming that the death-rates of the parish at large and of its sub-districts are, compared both with their death-rates in former years and with those of the rest of London, far from unfavorable. As regards zymotic diseases, Camberwell presents in many 22 respects the same conditions as London itself. Some diminished in severity, others increased in severity. Deaths from smallpox fell from 14 in 1863 to 10 in 1864, deaths from scarlet fever from 124 to 83, deaths from diphtheria from 29 to 16, and deaths from measles from 32 to 29. But deaths from hooping cough increased from 57 to 61, and deaths from fever from 41 to 51. Generally throughout the parish zymotic diseases prevailed less extensively and were less fatal in 1864 than in 1863. The deaths from the several forms of disease just enumerated were distributed according to districts as follows:—of small pox, 2 fatal cases occurred in Camberwell, 3 in Peckham and 5 in St. George's; of scarlet fever, 1 fatal case occurred in Dulwich, 21 fatal cases in Camberwell, 24 in Peckham and 37 in St. George's; of diphtheria, 2 fatal cases occurred in Dulwich, 4 in Camberwell, 6 in Peckham and 4 in St. George's; of measles, 7 fatal cases occurred in Camberwell, 9 in Peckham and 13 in St. George's; of hooping cough, 15 fatal cases occurred in Camberwell, 21 in Peckham and 25 in St. George's; and of fever, 25 fatal cases occurred in Camberwell, 18 in Peckham and 8 in St. George's. The only one of these diseases in reference to which I need make any special observations is that to which the term "fever'' is applied. It is well known that, during the years 1862, 1863 and 1864, typhus fever, which had for several years previously been absent from London, has prevailed here in an epidemic form. In 1862, 3635 deaths were in the Registrar General's returns ascribed to fever; in 1863, 2892 deaths were ascribed to the same disease; and in 1834, 3689. The epidemic therefore, which was severe in 1862, diminished in severity in 1863, and increased in severity in 1864, during which year the deaths from it were more numerous than they had been even in 1862. In Camberwell the fever mortality was (taking still the 23 Registrar General's numbers) in 1862, 65, in 1863, 50, and in 1864, 52;* so that there was in 1864 a considerable reduction in fever mortality from that which had obtained in 1862, and the increase above that which had obtained in 1863 was quite unimportant. But although the fever mortality has been generally sufficiently high, and the prevalence of fever sufficiently great to constitute a real typhus epidemic, the mortality due to the disease, relatively to the population, has been much smaller than these statements might lead one to suppose; for, assuming the population of London to have remained stationary since 1861, the fever mortality per cent, in 1864 was for all London, .1316, for the Western districts .0982, for the Northern districts .1420, for the Central districts .1087, for the Eastern districts .1498, and for the Southern districts .1408. And the fever mortality for Camberwell, assuming still the population to be no more numerous than it was in 1861, was only .072 per cent. For the St. George's district it was .054 per cent., for the Peckham district .06, and for the Camberwell district .012. In Dulwich there were no fever deaths. It must not be forgotten, however, that the deaths ascribed to fever include, besides typhus deaths, deaths from other febrile affections especially from typhoid or enteric fever, and that if these latter could be deducted, the mortality at present generally attibuted to typhus would become sensibly reduced. We know that for many years past enteric fever has prevailed, not largely but tolerably uniformly, throughout London; we know that during a certain period (from about 1856 to the end of 1861) typhus was absent from London, and that during this period * On a former page I make the fever deaths in Camberwell 41 in 1863, and 51 in 1864, having derived these numbers from my own interpretation of the Local Registrars' returns; but here, as generally elsewhere, when comparing Camberwell with other districts, I adopt for obvious reasons the Registrar General's figures. 24 the deaths ascribed to fever were almost exclusively deaths from enteric fever. Now during these years the fever deaths in Camberwell ranged from 19 to 31 per annum. We may assume then, roughly, that there was during this period an annual enteric fever death rate of 25. We may assume also that the deaths from this disease have, during the last three years, averaged about the same number. But if this be so, then it will be seen that the deaths from actual typhus—from the disease which has been lately epidemic, and about which so much has lately been written—were in our parish about 35 instead of 65 in 1862, and in 1863 and in 1864, about six or seven and twenty only, instead of 50 and 52. On the whole it must be admitted that an examination of the mortality due to fever and to other zymotic diseases confirms the favorable opinion which I have expressed as to the general healthiness of Camberwell and of its several districts during the year which has just elapsed. I should be sorry to have it supposed that in thus endeavouring to estimate the exact truth in reference to typhus, I am endeavouring to conceal in any degree the importance of the epidemic which has prevailed and still prevails, or in any degree to lessen the responsibility of those whose duty it is to watch over the public health. I have no such intention. I may add, in reference to this subject, that the rule which I have adopted has been to have all houses (especially houses of the poorer classes) inspected, in which deaths from typhus and other of the more important zymotic diseases have occurred, and to take such stepe in reference to them as the respective cases seem to require. The continued presence however of typhus in London, and the public notice which the alarm of the so called "Russian epidemic," has drawn to this continued presence, have led me to consider very seriously what is the best mode of dealing in London with epidemics of typhus and other "plagues," such as cholera, when they visit us. 25 In considering this question it is desirable first to point out briefly some of the more important characters of the disease before us. Typhus fever is an infectious fever, but though infectious is far less so than either scarlet fever or small pox; and hence it happens that, although it spreads rapidly and with virulence in the presence of the overcrowding, ill-ventilation and want of cleanliness, which characterize the dwellings of many of the poorer classes, solitary cases have been known over and over again to occur in the houses of the better classes without the extension of the disease to any other member of the household. Typhus fever again, like small pox and scarlet fever, is one of those affections which as a rule happen only once in a life time; and hence those who have once had it may be regarded as safe from future attacks; hence too when the disease has been sbsent for some years from any locality, and but few of those who have had the disease remain, the population becomes susceptible of its contagion, and the disease, if by any accident introduced, tends to assume among them an epidemic and virulent character, and to prevail, unless precautionary measures be adopted, until it has invaded the whole of the unprotected portion of the population. These considerations serve to shew that, among the better classes, the disease may be left with propriety to be dealt with by those who are personally interested in the welfare of the sick; but that among the poorer classes, both in the interests of those who who are attacked with the disease and in the interests of those among whom they dwell, the sick should be removed from their residences and treated away from their families in appropriate institutions. It will, perhaps, at once suggest itself that we already possess these institutions in our general hospitals and in the London Fever Hospital. And no doubt these places, in years when there 26 is no epidemic prevalence, are competent to deal with the scattered fever cases which occur; and even in the presence of an epidemic are competent to afford a certain amount of relief. But experience has shewn that this amount of relief is really very limited; and I may add, that in my belief the resources and arrangements of these institutions are wholly inadequate to meet all the exigencies of an epidemic. First, as regards the general hospitals; these have only a limited number of beds, 3 or 4000 in all; their income is limited, for they are supported either by a fixed annual revenue or (as in the majority of cases) by charity alone; and they have to meet as much during the presence of epidemics as at other times, all those ordinary claims upon them which they were designed to meet and which they cannot even at these times with justice neglect. 1 may add that, for my own part, I advocate and always have advocated the admission into these hospitals of a certain proportion of fever cases, and that the practice of at all events the larger London hospitals has been hitherto in accordance with this opinion. There are, nevertheless, some serious objections to this practice, and many persons both amongst physicians and lay managers of hospitals regard them as sufficiently serious to justify the exclusion of all fever cases from these institutions. Under any circumstances, the general public cannot demand of subscription hospitals any form of benefit beyond what the subscribers to these institutions think it right to offer; and even in the case of the endowed hospitals, of which there are but three, all that could be insisted on (taking the very broadest view of the claims of the general public upon them) is that which is at present granted, viz. that fever cases should be received into them in a certain proportion. Altogether then I have no hesitation in declaring that general hospitals, as at present constituted and supported, do not provide for and cannot meet the necessities which an epidemic creates. 27 Second, as regards the Fever Hospital; this is an admirable institution, admirably conducted and does great good; moreover the Poor Law Board evidently looks upon it as the proper place in which fever cases occurring amongst the poorest of the population should be treated. But to this opinion I am bound to demur, and mainly on two grounds. In the first place, there is the objection which arises from there being only one such institution to this vast metropolis; patients have to be brought to it from long distances, (they come even by direction of the Poor Law Board, from Greenwich and from Woolwich,) and of those who come long distances it is well known that no inconsiderable proportion die directly from the effects of their journey; again, if such an institution be designed to receive and treat all the fever cases occurring amongst the classes most prone to fever, it should be an institution not of hundreds of beds like the present, but I might almost say of thousands of beds, and the creation of such overgrown hospitals is contrary to the sanitary tendencies of the present day. In the second place, there is the objection that the fever hospital is dependent almost entirely on voluntary contributions. Now voluntary contributions are always difficult to obtain; and that it has been so in the case of the fever hospital is shewn by the late appeals which it has been necessary to make on its behalf to the charity of the public. What then would be the difficulty of obtaining adequate funds for the maintenance of the hospital if it consisted of 1000 beds (say) instead of about 300 as it does now? what would be the difficulty of obtaining money sufficient to maintain the buildings alone, at times when (as in the absence of epidemics) not more than 50 beds out of the 1000 are required for constant use? But surely that which is required for the general benefit and security of the public, ought not to depend on the support of the charitable few. 28 What seems to me to be needed is a number of institutions scattered over the metropolitan area, in such numbers and at such a distance from one another, as that no patient sick of typhus should need to be carried a dangerous distance to reach one of them; institutions to be maintained, not by the subscriptions of the charitable, but by rates equably levied from the public at large institutions, which in the absence of epidemics, might be used for other purposes. Such institutions we possess in our workhouse infirmaries; these are already acknowledged to be the hospitals for paupers and those whom sickness pauperizes, these conveniently stud the surface of the metropolis, these alone (among hospitals) are supported by funds provided for by law, and capable through the rates of increasing their income to meet any extraordinary demands which may be made upon them. I allow that at the present time the greater number of these institutions are quite unfit to receive cases of infectious diseases. But this unfitness is remediable. To enable them to treat typhus patients with propriety within their own walls, instead of sending them, as under the directions of the Poor Law Board they do now, for treatment elsewhere, it would be necessary for each workhouse to have in connection with it a detached ward or wards; to have these wards arranged and conducted on sound hygienic principles; to entrust the nursing duties to experienced and seasoned nurses only; and to have at all events during the height of an epidemic a resident medical officer. Further, all needless communication should be interdicted between the inmates of these wards and those of other wards in the infirmary. I have only sketched very generally the arrangement and management of fever wards; but it will be seen that these are very different from what are usually met with in workhouse infirmaries; and I may add, that if they were carried out thoroughly and well, there would be no 29 ger of typhus spreading either to the inmates of the general workhouse or to the inmates of other parts of the workhouse infirmary. The plan above sketched would not preclude two or three contiguous parishes from combining, if it seemed advantageous for them to do so, to erect and maintain a common fever house; it is obvious too that wards capable of receiving fever cases would be capable of receiving any other form of infectious diseases, and might in the absence of such diseases be used for the reception of the ordinary sick. The main points in the plan which I propose are, that there shall be many fever houses, and that they shall be paid for out of the rates. I suggest the workhouse infirmaries for fever houses, because they abundantly fulfil these cardinal conditions; and because, though it might be a matter of some little expense, it would be a matter of no real difficulty to make, in connection with them, the necessary arrangements and to provide the necessary buildings. I may point out finally in relation to this subject, that unless power be given by the Legislature to local authorities or those acting under them, to insist on the removal of such as are sick of infectious diseases to the institutions whatever they may be which may be provided for their treatment, neither the plan which I have advocated nor any other plan that can be conceived of, will avail to arrest the progress amongst the poorer classes of epidemics of typhus or other such diseases. During the twelve months, which ended on the 31st March, 1865, the ordinary sanitary labours of my department were systematically carried out (Table VIII.) 1454 houses were inspected in the course of the usual house to house visitation, and 874 complaints in reference to nuisances arising from accmulations of ashes, refuse, dung, from pigs, manufactories, &c., 30 were investigated, and for the most part satisfactorily disposed of. 193 houses were white-washed and cleansed and 33 were repaired. In 117 instances water for drinking purposes was supplied to houses, and in 49 instances to closets. 231 cesspools were emptied; 62 were filled up and abolished; and 45 water closets (with the necessary drainage) were provided. 132 drains were trapped, or cleansed; and 97 yards were paved or had their pavement amended. Besides the above, 55 slaughterhouses, 64 cow-houses and 84 bake-houses were inspected and kept under supervision. The execution of the above works needed the issue of 306 notices to owners or occupiers of houses, of which 13 had to be repeated. Only 8 summonses were needed. At the end of the year 8 works for which notices had been served were still incomplete. The gas of the South Metropolitan Gas Company; and the waters of the Southwark and Vauxhall, of the Lambeth and of the Kent Companies have during the year been periodically examined, And both the gas and the several waters have been invariably found to be in a satisfactory condition. I have lastly, Gentlemen, to express my approval of the way in which the Inspectors of Nuisances have performed the duties which have devolved upon them; and to thank you for the continued kindness which I receive at your hands. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, May 31st, 1865. J. S. BRISTOWE. Table I.—Shewing the Mortality of the Parish of Camberwell in Districts during the year 1864. At what Ages?
