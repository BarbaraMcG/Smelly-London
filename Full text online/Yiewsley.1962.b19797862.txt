To: The Chairman and Members of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report for the year ending 31st December, 1962, and I trust it will give you some idea of the work carried out by the Public Health Department in the year under review. Dr. L. F. Keenan continued to act as temporary Medical Officer of Health until my return to duty on 1st April. I am greatly indebted to him for undertaking this responsibility and 1 wish again to express my personal thanks to him and also the thanks of the Staff of the Public Health Department. The mid-year population as estimated by the Registrar General was 23,930, which again shows an increase on last year of 270. The estimated number of inhabited dwellings rose to 6,909 (an increase of 44). Deaths from all causes totalled 212, giving an adjusted death rate of 12.74 per 1,000 population. Live Births totalled 463, giving an adjusted birth rate of 17.3 per 1,000 population. There were no Maternal deaths, infantile (Neo Natal) deaths numbered 7, and of these, 5 were under one week old. the causes being. Prematurity. 3 ; Congenital Abnormality, 3 and Broncho Pneumonia, 1. In general the health of the area was very good. There was no epidemic of any infectious disease and the number of cases of notifiable disease was very small. There was only one case of Poliomyelitis and one case of Food Poisoning. New cases of Tuberculosis notified were 11 in number, with age groups varying from 25 to 61 years. There were no deaths from Tuberculosis. 6 Cancer was the principal cause of death—45 cases—of which 16 were due to Lung Cancer, 15 male and 1 female. Coronary disease and Angina came very close to being the principal cause of death—42 cases notified. Infantile deaths (under 1 year) numbered 10, including the 7 mentioned above and also Congenital Abnormality 1, acute Pneumonia 1, and Streptococcal Meningitis 1. The progress of rehousing from Clearance Areas continues and the second five year Slum Clearance plan has made good progress as more than half the programme has been fulfilled. Smoke Control Orders for Areas 3 and 4 were confirmed and brought into operation during the year. As will be seen in the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector, the sewering of Longford Village was completed during the year, and I know that the completing of this work gave Mr. Makin great satisfaction. In regard to Health Education, members of the Public Health Staff continue to give lectures to various organisations and posters are displayed concerning the various aspects of Health Education and also about Road Safety. London Airport continues to increase, so also do the multifarious (duties of our Public Health Staff here to cope with the increasing amount of work and inspection necessary. Mrs. Taylor, Secretary and Chief Clerk to Mr. Makin, had to resign during the year owing to continued illness. I and all the Staff ot the Public Health Department felt very sorry to lose her. I wish to thank our Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. Makin, and his deputy, Mr. Marshall and all members of the Public Health Staff for their loyalty and assistance. I also wish to thank the Clerk of the Council, Mr. Bradford, for his ever-ready advice and assistance. In conclusion, I regret that this will be my last report as Medical Officer of Health as I shall be retiring in the ensuing months and I wish to place on record my thanks to all the members of the Council, past and present, for their support and consideration over the past 24 years 7 SECTION A Area in acres 5,276 Total population 1962 (midsummer) (estimated by the Registrar General) 23,930 Estimated number of inhabited dwellings 6,909 Rateable Value (31st March, 1962) £864,774 Product of the Penny Rate 1962/63 £4,455 1 11 VITAL STATISTICS LIVE BIRTHS: Male Female Total Legitimate 228 211 439 Illegitimate 12 12 24 240 223 463 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 estimated population (adjusted): 1962: 17.3* „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ 1961: 17.3* County of Middlesex: 1962: 17.0 *These figures have been adjusted from 19.3 and 19.27 by the Registrar's Comparability Factor of .90.

The Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale have also undertaken work in connection with the analysis of food imported into this country via London Airport, as most of the imported food arriving at London Docks is also examined by this Laboratory. Reference to work done in connection with this matter can be seen in the chapter on London Airport. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE The responsibility for this service is with the Middlesex County Council and the Medical Officer of Area 8, i.e. the area in which this Urban District is situated, is Dr. O. C. Dobson. There are two clinics in the district, one at 20, High Street, Yiewsley and one in Harmondsworth. There is also a mobile clinic which operates in the Urban District. MASSACE ESTABLISHMENTS The Council maintain a register of these establishments operating in the Urban District and the three establishments have been inspected during the year and have had their licences renewed. 12 SECTION C PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES.

Patrick M. J. Bobbett, Medical Officer of Health. 14 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR FOR THE YEAR 1962 July, 1963. To : The Chairman and Members of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District Council. Madam Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for 1962. Members will remember that during 1961 the Department's work suffered owing to the absence, due to sickness, of Mrs. Taylor, my Secretary and Chief Clerk, and it was a sad loss that Mrs. Taylor finally had to resign owing to continuing illness. Her position was only filled late in the year. I also reported how difficult the clerical work proved to be at the weighbridge, but this was overcome with the appointment of the present Clerk who is keeping all records up to date satisfactorily. The wide range of Public Health Environmental duties was carried ou: satisfactorily and the second five-year slum clearance programme ending in 1965 is proceeding well, two thirds of the programme being completed. A successful attempt to bring the Council's Smoke Control Area Programme up to date was achieved by the confirmation and bringing into operation of Smoke Control Orders Nos. 3 and 4. For many years, in past Annual Reports, I felt it my duty to report the desirability of sewering the village of Longford and this was finally completed in the middle of the year. I report in greater detail on this project elsewhere in my report. Imported food to this Country has been carefully checked and the result of the Department's work in this connection, shown elsewhere in this report, will, I hope, be interesting to read. There is a sense of satisfaction — although this work is most inconvenient to Inspectors having to do inspections during the night—in knowing that the Health Department is watching not only its local areas food supplies, but the nation's, if only to a small extent. I feel that I must make reference at this point to the fact that Dr. Bobbett will be retiring in 1963 and to put on record my appreciation of him. He has, during my 24 years service with the Council, never failed to help and encourage me, and 1 trust that he will enjoy a long and happy retirement. My colleagues in the Public Health Department all join me in this wish. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Alfred Makin, Chief Public Health Inspector. 15 SECTION D WATER SUPPLY Mains water was supplied by Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company. No adverse complaints about the area's water supply were received during the year and a typical bacteriological and chemical examination result is shown for your information. The results refer to water pumped from the West Drayton Pumping Station. Hardness in the water is an inconvenience one has come to accept, but it is nevertheless a financial burden on the Council who are continually defurring Council house plumbing systems due to its effects. There are only 5 houses in the Urban District where the water supply is derived from wells. 16 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Location Type Residual Chlorine p.p.m. Colonies per ml 2 days Colonies per ml 3 days Bad. coli (Type 1) Probable number per 100 ml Presumptive Coliaerogenes Probable number per 100 ml West Drayton P.S.

The Council saw fit to congratulate the Refuse Collectors for the very good work which, as everyone knows, must continue no matter what the weather is like. Disposal of refuse continued at two tips, one in Cherry Lane, the other in Stockley. What with the extraordinary amount of refuse received by an Urban District of this size, great care and a great deal of supervision is essential to maintain the organisation and plant necessary to cope with the many problems involved. London Airport continued to get twice daily collections from the Council although towards the end of the year the service was taxed to breaking point because of increased commitments there. Towards the end of the year trial collections, working a twice daily, instead of a day and night collection ,were being conducted as an experimental exercise and more will need to be said in a later report about this. 18 The table showing costs for Refuse Collection and Refuse Disposal for the Year ended 31st March, 1963, is below:— Item Particulars Collection Costs Disposal Costs Total Conservancy Total (All services) A Gross Expenditure 21871 3 2 53994 2 9 75865 5 11 3405 8 9 79270 14 B Gross Income 11164 13 2 72000 8 7 83165 1 9 2450 9 2 85615 10 11 C Net Cost 10706 10 0 — — 954 19 7 — Net Income — 18006 5 10 7299 15 10 — 6344 16 3 UNIT COSTS.

The scheme covers the installation of main drainage along the Old Bath Road from the Peggy Bedford public house to Kings Bridge. Until the advent of the scheme the whole of this area, which comprises some 90 dwellings, was on Cesspit drainage. The scheme is in two parts — the Duke of Northumberland's River forms a barrier and the area to the West of this river could not drain by gravity to the main sewer near the Peggy Bedford. The scheme is therefore a gravity sewer, 9" diameter, draining the area to the east of the river and a combined gravity and pumped system draining the area to the west. The western section comprises 6" diameter gravity sewer bringing the sew age from this area to a pump house sited behind the "White Horse" public house. From this pump house a 4" diameter rising main carried the sewage over the river discharging into the head manhole of the 9" diameter gravity sewer. The whole construction was made difficult by the very high ground water table—most of the pipes were laid below the river level—and by the nature of the ground, which was loose water beaiing gravel and in some places running sand. In all, 50 cesspools were done away with and ample provision was made for all future development to be taken into the new system. The gravity section to the east of the river has been operational since November. 1961 and the whole scheme since early March of this year. (b) General. The only properties in the Urban District not yet connected to the main drainage system are: — (1) West Drayton Common — 18 houses. (2) Stockley — 8 houses and 4 factories. (3) Caravan Site — (a) Municipal Caravan Site (West Drayton). (b) Riverside Caravan Site (West Drayton). (c) Mayfield Caravan Site (West Drayton). (4) Harmondsworth Moor — 2 houses. 20 SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES GENERAL SANITATION Water Supply 26 Drainage 122 Stables and Piggeries 27 Fried Fish Shops 4 Tents, Vans and Sheds 341 Factories 208 Workshops 1 Workplaces l6 Outworkers 24 Bakehouses 7 Public Conveniences 37 Licensed Premises 34 Refuse Collection 44 Refuse Disposal 72 Rats and Mice 257 Schools 6 Shops 34 Miscellaneous Sanitary Visits 236 Petroleum 34 Clean Air 664 Buffer Depot 37 Noise Abatement I HOUSING: Under Public Health Act: No. of Houses inspected 90 Visits paid to above houses 222 Under Housing Acts: No. of Houses inspected 80 Visits paid to above houses 351 21 Overcrowding: No. of Houses inspected 4 Visits paid to above houses 4 Filthy or Verminous Premises: No. of Houses inspected 21 Visits paid to above houses 25 Miscellaneous housing visits 278 INFECTIOUS DISEASES Inquiries in cases of I D. 32 Visits re : disinfection 1 Miscellaneous infectious disease visits 145 MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION Inspection of Meat: Visits to Slaughterhouse 460 Visits to shops and stalls 4 Total Meat inspection visits 1 Visits to: Bakeries 4 Butchers 29 Canteens 77 Dairies and milk distributors 7 Fishmongers and poulterers 11 Food Preparing premises 93 Grocers 75 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 12 Ice-cream premises 15 Market Stalls 5 Restaurants 24 22 Visits in connection with sampling: Milk—Bacteriological 5 Ice Cream 6 Miscellaneous food visits 71 London Airport 385 Licensed premises 14 NOTICES SERVED No. of nuisances found 39 No. of nuisances abated 23 No. of verbal notices served 17 No. of verbal notices complied with 17 No. of Informal notices served 48 No. of Informal notices complied with 17 No. of Statutory notices served 11 No. of Statutory notices complied with 7 23 DEFECTS REMEDIED AND IMPROVEMENTS EFFECTED Dwelling Houses: Roofs: Repaired or renewed 16 External walls: pointed or rendered 19 External walls: brickwork rebuilt Chimney Stacks: repaired or rebuilt 3 Gutters cleared, repaired or renewed 10 Wallplaster: repaired or renewed 15 Damp walls: rendered damp-proof 20 Ceilings: repaired or renewed 10 Floors: repaired or renewed 15 Windows: repaired or renewed 52 Sashcords: renewed 6 Additional lighting provided 2 Stairs: repaired or renewed 3 Doors: repaired or renewed 14 Walls: cleansed or redecorated 6 Woodwork: repaired or renewed 4 Firegrates: repaired or renewed 2 Sinks: new, provided 2 Sinks: Wastepipes, repaired, renewed or trapped 3 Repairs to water supplies 2 Food stores: provided and repaired 3 Gypsy vans removed 30 Miscellaneous defects remedied 1 Drainage: Choked drains cleared 331 Old drains repaired 2 Inspection chambers repaired 1 New drains provided 1 New gullies inserted 1 New inspection chambers provided 1 Other defects remedied 1 Water Closets: Flushing cisterns repaired or renewed 1 New closets provided 3 Pans renewed Other defects 1 Dustbins: New : provided 6 Miscellaneous: Offensive accummulations removed 3 Verminous reoms disinfected 4 24 RODENT CONTROL The Rodent Control Service operated throughout the year even though the operator was ill for quite some lime. During his illness complaints were investigated by an Inspector who visited the premises, advised action, and left bait for any complainant to lay himself, with instructions on care and the use of the bait.

I am pleased to report that the service has operated efficiently throughout the year. As before much work has been done without fuss. All complaints leceived from the general public continue to be dealt with as soon as possible. It is a happy thought to realise that so far as rodent control is concerned the public is very much on the alert and is most co-operative with the Local Authority in its efforts to control this particular pest. One appreciates that this branch is but one small cog in the wheel of public health service to the ratepayers but it plays its part in no small measure in maintaining the well-being of the inhabitants of the district. Your sewers are still being treated bi-annually by the specialist firm who have now carried out this control for the past three years. I am happy to say that the general level of infestation in the sewers is low ; this despite the added load of new housing estates, but none the less vigilance is maintained and it is only through sustained effort by the department, that the rat population is kept down to a low level. Compared to the previous year the incidence of infestations throughout the district remains about the same. It goes withoui saying that the surveillance of your tips is regarded as of the utmost importance and routine checks are made as a matter of course. As in previous years infestation control of the banks of the Duke of Northumberland's river is carried out on behalf of the Middlesex County Council. Once again I am pleased to report that it was not necessary in any instance lo carry out statutory action in connection with a reported infestation. 27 FOOD INSPECTIONS Regular inspections of all types of food premises continued throughout the whole year and where action needed to be taken this was done, in the form of advice, sometimes by notice and reports to the Public Health Committee in cases where authority for legal action for non-compliance was needed.

Four mobile vehicles are registered under the Middlesex County Council Act for the sale of ice-cream. Two other mobile canteens which are stationed on the grass verge of the Great South West Road near London Airport were inspected under the Food Hygiene Regulations 1960 but the Council decided that a Street Trading Licence, under Section 320 of the Middlesex County Council Act 1944, did not apply owing to the peculiar situation of the vans on the grass verge. The Police were informed of this situation for any action they considered might be necessary if road obstructions were caused by motorists stopping for refreshments from these vans. 28 2 Defects found in Factories : Particulars Number of cases in which defects were found Number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted Found Remedied To H.M.

The fifth area, Whites Cottages, Bath Road, Harlington, is held up because the Crown have part interest in the freehold of the property and a legal complication has arisen. Negotiations are taking place to arrive at a solution. 30 RENT ACT 1957 Part I—Applications for Certificates of Disrepair.

Their condition, over the whole of the Urban District can be considered extremely good. Ice Cream : 6 ice-cream samples were taken during the year under review, and the results of these, which were satisfactory, are shown in the provision grade below : — Grade No. of Samples 1 6 2 — 3 — 4 — Food Inspections: The following table shows the amount of food condemned during the year under review, but does not include meat condemned at the Slaughterhouse Lbs.

The number of pigs weighed and graded totalled 3 862 and the income to the Council was £113 7s. 6d. From a total number of 6,672 animals inspected it was necessary to condemn 1 ton 15 cwts. 0 qrs. 22 lbs. of pork, beef, mutton and veal which was diseased and unfit for consumption. All condemned meat was coloured with an approved dye and sent, by arrangement, to Smithfield Animal Products Ltd., for processing into fertilisers. My thanks are due to both the Director of the Pathological Laboratory at Hillingdon and the Director of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Research Laboratory at Byfleet, whose services and help have been available when difficult diagnosis of disease has been encountered.

Samples procured in Yiewsley and West Drayton during this year 1962. Article Procured Total Samples Unsatisfactory Milk 3 Butter 18 Cakes and Biscuits 2 1 Cream 12 Drugs 3 Fish and Fish Products 14 Fruit (all kinds) 6 Ice Cream 17 Liver 32 1 Margarine 3 Meat and Meat Products 24 Sausages 6 Spirits 7 Vinegar 3 Miscellaneous 12 T otals 162 2 Mr. O'Keefe also made the following comments in connection with the Food and Drugs Act 1955. "The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953 Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 72 premises, and 14 stacks and displays of meat, 91 of apples, 38 of tomatoes, 69 of butter and 30 of other miscellaneous foods were examined for compliancs with the Orders. One infringement was disclosed as a result of which, for exposing imported meat and offal not marked with the country of origin, a butcher in your district was cautioned. Other minor infringements were dealt with by verbal warning. 35 Safe Milk Six samples of pasteurised or sterilised milk were procured from retailers in the district and tested to ascertain whether or not pasteurisation or sterilisation had been correctly performed. No failures have been reported. Seven inspections of premises at which milk is pasteurised or at which it is sold were carried out during the year to ensure that the premises concerned conformed to the requirements of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The Labelling of Food Order, 1953 This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller. or to bear a registered trade mark; to be marked with its common or usual name or its appropriate designation; and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. A total of 41 premises have been visited in connection with the Order, and 256 articles of food have been examined. One infringement was disclosed. A tin of creamed rice milk pudding was labelled as being made from skimmed milk powder, milk, rice and sugar. In fact it was made from milk, rice and sugar. Correction of the label was secured. Labelling and Advertising of Foodstuffs A considerable amount of work was done in the year which, whilst it did not arise from samples and inspections in the area of Yiewsley and West Drayton, nevertheless has the effect of protecting the residents of your county district. The matters mentioned below were of nationally retailed articles of food, which are widely distributed throughout the County. Several manufacturers and importers were reminded of the obligation to put on the labels of food the name and address of the packer or labeller. Similar action was taken in respect of pickles, canned peas and mixed vegetables which did not bear a statement of ingredients. One manufacturer of icecream was found to be putting all the statutory declarations on the base of the carton. He was reminded that these declarations are required to be both conspicuous and prominent. Two advertisements for honey did not disclose that the honeys offered were of foreign origin. The Merchandise Marks Act requires this and letters were sent to the advertisers reminding them of their obligations to declare the origin in advertisements. Some prepacked lamb chops found to be generally on sale were of imported origin. The declaration in such a case is required to be in half-inch letters ; the lettering used was so small as to be quite inconspicuous, and the packers were required to comply with the prescribed conditions. 36 Matters dealt with under the Food and Drugs Act by correspondence included a sample of cream cheese containing less milk fat than, was considered sufficient to justify the title. Five examples of cake-mixes, which were not complete mixes in that other additions, such as egg or milk were necessary before the mix could be used, were found. The manufacturers were required prominently to show what additions were necessary. The manufacturers of four brands of milk pudding which were described on the label as "creamed rice" were challenged on the ground that the product was in fact a rice milk pudding and not creamed rice. Correction to the labels was secured. The manufacturer of a lemon juice was challenged that a claim on the label for slimming properties for the juice was not justified and he amended his labels to delete the claim. A sample of cream was procured which was labelled "thick cream". The fat content of this cream was less than the standard prescribed for thick cream and the product was re-labelled "sterilised cream". A manufacturer of a canned meat product claimed on the label that it was "full of lean red meat". In fact, the meat content was no more than is normal for this class of product, and the manufacturer was therefore challenged as to the accuracy of the claim. It was withdrawn. It was claimed for a sample of chopped pork that it contained "more meat". In fact the percentage of meat was no greater than that of comparable products and the manufacturer was required to delete the claim. The manufacturers of several breakfast cereals were challenged on the ground that the labels claimed the foods to be "vitamin enriched". The vitamins present did not provide one half of the daily requirement which, it is considered, is the minimum to support claim to enrichment. The labels were amended to "vitamin fortified" which, because vitamins were added, was true. A sample of ice lollies for which it was claimed that glucose was present, was found on analysis not to be correct. It was found that originally that the lollies had been made with added glucose, but glucose had been dropped from the recipe. The label was not amended to conform to the new recipe and was therefore incorrect. Reference to glucose was deleted from the new labels. A sample of butter mintoes was labelled "made with butler". This was not true; other fats were present as well; the label was amended after representations, to the manufacturer to "contains butter". A sample of sodium fluoride tablets was found on analysis to be deficient of the stated amount of the chemical. Because, in spite of the deficiency in the chemical, it was considered that the efficacy of the tablets was not impaired, the manufacturer was sent a letter of caution. 37 Two samples of instant coffee were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative not at the time permitted in instant coffee. The manufacturers and importers concerned were sent letters of caution. Similar action was taken in respect of a sample of dried apricots which were found to contain sulphur dioxide. The quantity of preservative would have been satisfactory if its presence had been declared, and the manufacturers were required to amend the label. A firm of confectionery importers were cautioned for selling sweets containing colouring matter not permitted. The firm had withdrawn from retailers sweets imported earlier and had thought the stock from which the sample was procured was satisfactory. Only permitted colours are now used. During the year a manufacturer put on to the market with a large scale newspaper advertising campaign a new product which consisted of 99% pure sugar with 1% of saccharin. It was claimed for this product that it was ' Slimmers Sugar". The manufacturer was challenged on the ground that the product (because it contained scharin) was not sugar. Exception was taken to advertising matter for the same reasons. Correction of advertising matter and the labels was secured, the manufacturer devising a new description for his product. An advertisement for vitamin capsules made extravagant claims. On being challenged, the advertisement and literature were modified so as to delete the objectionable wording used". SECTION C GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH GYPSIES AND DIDICOITS This problem again had to be dealt with by your Inspectors, but in July the Middlesex County Council held a Conference at which it was decided that in order to ascertain the full extent of this problem as far as Middlesex was concerned, a survey should be made on an appointed day, in all county districts. This survey was indeed carried out on the 15.10.62 and the Statistical table and report shown hereunder, will, I am sure, be of interest. 38 SURVEY OF GYPSY OR ITINERANT CARAVAN DWELLERS IN MIDDLESEX October 15th, 1962 District Sites Caravans Other Vehicles Families Adults Children Animals Would move to permanent pitch Expenses incurred in clearing Yes No Enfield 4 70 72 60 128 129 58 49 11 Finchley 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 Potters Bar 1 4 5 3 7 5 8 2 1 No record.

Area No. 3 contained 1087 acres and was bounded "in the north by the Parish Boundary of Harmondsworth proceeding eastwards to its junction with the West side of Holloway Lane; thence southwards along the West side of Holloway Lane, the West side of Hatch Lane, across the Bath Road, and along the West Perimeter Road of the London Airport to its junction with the Urban District Boundary proceeding north westwards along this boundary and thence northwards to its junction with the Parish Boundary of Harmondsworth". Area No. 4 contained 491 acres and was bounded by "the Ward Boundary of Harmondsworth, the west side of Harmondsworth Road, the west side of Station Road to its junction with Church Road, the south side of Church Road, west side of Swan Road to its junction with Old Farm Road, the south side of Old Farm Road and westwards to the River Colne and on to its junction with the Urban District Boundary and then bounded in the west by the Urban District Boundary, West Drayton".

A fine of £5 was imposed on an employee in a bakery for smoking while engaged in the handling of food. 2. A dairy was fined £20 with £6 costs for selling milk not of the nature, substance or quality demanded by the purchaser. 3. A catering firm was fined £10 with £6 6s. 0d. costs for selling food not of the nature or quality demanded by the purchaser. 4. Fines of 40/- were imposed on the occupiers of four caravans, for stationing caravans contrary to Section 268 of the Public Health Aci 1936 such as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance, Court Orders in each case required the removal of the caravans in a specified time. 5. Two fines, one of £350 and one of £30 were imposed on the owner of premises, for non-compliance with Demolition Orders The same owner was lined £415 and £384 for non compliance with Court Orders in respect of the above Demolition Orders. 40 LONDON AIRPORT The complete transfer of all long-haul passenger handling from the North Terminal Area took place during the year and there are now additional catering establishments, offices and shops occupying the new Passenger Building No. 3. The catering section of the premises is a great improvement on the old premises formerly situated in the North Terminal Area. British European Airways also completed its new Aircraft Catering Premises on North Terminal Area and abandoned former premises in the Passenger Building No. 1 in Central Terminal Area. These new premises are the acme of perfection as far as aircraft catering is concerned and although much larger than the Companies' old premises should not present much of a problem as far as hygiene is concerned because the constructional finishes have been designed for ease of maintenance and cleaning. Pan American World Airways System also completed its new Aircraft Catering Premises in No. 2 Maintenance Area near the Great South Road. These premises are also a vast improvement over the old. In both cases Registration Certificates under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act 1955 were granted to the Airline Operating Companies concerned, and there was also satisfactory compliance with the Clean Air Act 1956 as regards the furnaces operating from both establishments. All other catering and food premises on the Airport were inspected regularly during the year and no food poisoning of any description was notified. Food Inspection The Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations 1937-48 were administered by your Staff and 108 tons 19 cwts. 3 qrs. 4 lbs. of food imported into the Country from Austria, Germany, Australia, U.S.A., France, Holland, Czechoslovakia and Ireland were inspected. 385 inspections during the day and night were made. Details of the various foods inspected are as follows:— Tons C wis. Qrs. Lbs. Confectionery and Flour Confectionery 1 2 3 15 Fresh Meat 26 6 0 9 Cooked Meat and Meat Products 23 18 0 27 Salami and Other Sausages 28 16 3 21 Fish 5 16 2 25 Shellfish 1 3 3 2 Fruit 1 14 3 27 Vegetables 4 3 3 18 Offal 1 16 1 22 Cheese 3 4 2 16 Miscellaneous 11 0 3 0 41 In addition to the above inspections, sampling of foods was also carried out and the results are shown hereunder: — Foodstuff No. of Samples Taken Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Gypsy Pork Roast 14 5 9 Egg Mayonnaise 1 1 - Meat Mayonnaise 1 1 - Prepared Meal in Metal Tray (frozen) l 1 - Sausage 3 2 1 Salami 4 4 - Dried Mushroom 2 2 - Cooked Pork Luncheon Meat 1 1 - Powdered Mayonnaise 1 1 - Gypsy Pork Roll 2 - 2 Tinned Chicken 1 1 - TOTALS 31 19 12 Appropriate action was taken in all cases where imported food did not comply with regulations regarding Official Certificates, or was unfit. Drinking Water from Aircraft 60 samples of drinking water were taken from Aircraft during the year and details of these are as follows:— Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Taken from fixed tank system 6 - Taken from portable flasks 47 7 Taken from Bowsers - - Taken from Mains Water - - 53 7 Petroleum Installations The four major fuel storage installations were again licensed for the year, and all alterations to both storage and supply lines were inspected and approved. Paraffin Fumes and Smoke from Aircraft It has been considered and decided that any action in this respect is firmly excluded from existing legislation and that no action is possible except perhaps under common law. 42 WEST DRAYTON PRINTING COMPANY
