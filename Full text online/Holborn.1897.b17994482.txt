BURKI, GALE, GARRITY, JONES, MUNT, PUTTERILL. Medical Officer's Annual Report, -1897. - To the Chairman and Members of the Sanitary Committee of the Holborn Hoard of Guardians. Gentlemen, I beg to present my Report for 1897 in accordance with your instructions and those of the Local Government Board. During the twelve months I have to record the occurrence of five deaths. The causes of death being as follows: — 1. Male, aged 67, Pensioner of the Charterhouse. From Cerebral Hæmorrhage. 2.Male, aged 68, resident in Furnival's Inn. Paralysis of the Brain. 3. Male, aged 70, the Master of the Charterhouse. Carcinoma. 4. Male, aged 89, Pensioner of the Charterhouse. Senile Tuberculosis. 5. Male, aged 85, Pensioner of the Charterhouse. Bronchitis. In all these cases the noticeable features are the same as in previous years, viz.: first, the advanced age of those dying —the average mean at death being 75.8 years (as compared with 75.7 last year), and secondly, the causes of death being those generally associated with old age or constitutional disease. It should be recorded, with regret, that one of the five deaths registered was that of Canon Elwyn, the Master of the Charterhouse, who died at the Charterhouse, on September 28th, ten days after an operation for cancer. There have been three births registered within the district during 1897, all of them occurring within the Charterhouse division. No case of infectious disease has occurred. 2 The Committee has had under its consideration the regular cleaning and efficient repair of Forester's Hall Place. On March 25th the Committee terminated its agreement with the Clerkenwell Vestry for carrying out the necessary works to maintain this cul de sac in order. From that date it has fallen to the duty of this Sanitary Authority to draw the attention of the occupiers to their responsibility in this respect, and this matter has received their careful and periodical supervision. Regular inspection of the district has been made, and under the direction of Mr. Green, the Sanitary Inspector, the following works have been carried out: — Charterhouse Buildings, choked drain. 1, „ „ foul water cistern. 2, 3, 8, and 13, Charterhouse Buildings, uncleansed workshops. 10, Charterhouse Buildings, defective soil pipe and drain. 13 „ „ defective paving in yard, additional W.C. 15 „ „ defective closets, dirty yard and workshop. 19 „ „ foul water cistern. 21 „ „ defective W.C. 22 „ „ defective water supply apparatus to closets and its effects. 24 „ „ defective soil pipe reconstructed.
