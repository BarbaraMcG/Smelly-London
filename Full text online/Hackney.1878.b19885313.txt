HACKNEY DISTRICT. REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1878, ON THE Analyses of Food sold in the District, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Vice-President of the Society of Public Analysts. Public Analyst for the Hackney District. LONDON: A. T. ROBERTS, SON & CO., PRINTERS, 5, HACKNEY ROAD. 1879. REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST FOR THE YEAR 1878. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, During the past year I have analyzed 121 samples of food and drink and found 17 adulterated in addition to several others which were sold as being mixtures, and contained varying proportions of the article asked for by the purchaser. Most of the articles submitted for analysis were purchased by the inspector or a boy employed by him, but some were sent from the Hackney Union, and 2 were brought here by private purchasers. The list of articles submitted contains the following: Butter 6, Tea 8, Gin 6, Rum 2, Brandy 4, Whiskey 3, Sweets 10, Pepper 3, Flour 9, Bread 2, Coffee 6, Arrowroot 2, Ices 10, Pump Water 3, Cocoa 8, Mustard 3, Oatmeal 2, and Milk 24; the details of these have already been submitted to you in my quarterly reports, copies of which I now lay before you as part of my report for the past year. Report for the quarter ending March 31st, 1878.—The articles analyzed were Tea, Gin, Rum, Whiskey, Brandy, Sweets and Pepper, and the analysis gave the following results: out of six samples of Gin as many as five were diluted, some 4 to a considerable extent, the strength of each being respectively 31.8, 25.6, 24.5, 37.4, and 37.0 under proof, the price charged being the same in all instances; the Rum was stronger, one sample being 18.5 under proof and of good quality, and the other 28.0 and of inferior quality, price the same; the samples of Brandy varied very much in quality as well as in strength, one being 18 under proof and fairly good, another 21 under proof and of good quality, the third was 16.8 under proof but decidedly coarse, and the fourth 13 under proof was also coarse, and the prices of the two former was 1/- and of the two latter 10d. per quartern; the Whiskey had the following strengths, 20, 16.8 and 26 under proof, fairly good as to quality, the price the same for each. Report for the Quarter ending June 30th, 1878.—The samples analyzed were 14 of Milk, 8 of Flour, 6 of Coffee, and 2 of Arrowroot. The results of the examination of 14 samples of Milk show that the penalties inflicted on milkmen under this Act are not sufficient to prevent the adulteration of milk being carried out to a large extent; one of the samples was sent from the Union Infirmary by the resident Medical Officer, and all the others were obtained by a boy employed by the Inspector who took possession of the Milk and other articles as soon as purchased. Out of the 14 samples of Milk as many as 8 were more or less mixed with water, 5 to a sufficient extent to justify a prosecution being successfully carried out and in all these cases penalties were inflicted by the Magistrates, (amounting to six Pounds) varying from 10 to 40 shillings; the dilution with water was as follows, three with 8 per cent. one with 15, one with 20, two with 24 and one with 34 per cent. The flour examined was found to be pure, except, as regards one sample, in which there was a little rice flour, but of so small a quantity as to render it doubtful if its 5 presence were not accidental. The six samples of Coffee were free from foreign admixture, but some were of a very low quality, having but little of the flavor or smell of Coffee. I was informed by the inspector that at four shops a package labelled "this is a mixture of coffee and chicory," was handed to the boy when he asked for coffee, but was returned by him when he received the article handed over to me. It is therefore evident that it is a common custom to sell coffee and chicory mixed, but labelled as such, when coffee is asked for. The Arrowroot was genuine. Report for the quarter ending 30th September.—The articles analysed were Butter 6, Bread 2, Flour 2, Ices 9, Water 1, and Milk 11. During this quarter I have analysed 30 samples of food and 1 of water. The samples consisted of 6 of Butter, 5 of which were genuine and 1 mixed with 42 per cent, of foreign fat, but was labelled as being a mixture. There were 2 samples of flour and 2 of bread, 1 of the Bread and Flour having been sent from the Union Workhouse, these were unadulterated, but one sample of bread previously submitted contained damaged flour; this sample was not sent from the authorities but from a person who had received it as out-door relief, and the damage was such as would have occurred from bad storage. The ten samples of Ices were obtained from stalls in the street, or from small shops, and were all good, the lemon ices contained the juice of the lemon and were not mixed with sulphuric acid; the raspberry ices contained some of the pips and fruit of the raspberry, the milk was of much better quality then before, as in 1 only out of 11 was the adulteration large, viz., 24 per cent. of added water. In one as the adulteration was only 8 per cent I did not advise a prosecution especially as the milk had not been skimmed; a prosecution was not instituted for the one containing 13 6 per cent. of water, as there was an informality in the purchase; so that there was only one prosecution when the defendent was fined 20s. The sample of Water was procured from a well on the premises of a cowkeeper and was very bad, as it contained 101 grains of total solids per gallon, of which nearly 10 grains were of chlorides. During the quarter ending 31st December.—The articles analysed were Water 2, Sweets 6, Milk 8, Cocoa 9, Mustard 3 and Oatmeal 2. One sample of Milk was mixed with 7 per cent. of Water; 1 with 8 per cent. and another with 18 per cent. One sample of Mustard was adulterated with 50 per cent of a mixture of flour, tumeric and cayenne. All the samples brought to me during the quarter have been supplied by the Inspector; the 2 samples of Water were taken from pumps in two cowkeepers yards, and contained a large amount of ammonia, chlorides, and other evidences of sewer contamination. The whole of the sweets were genuine and the colouring matter was of vegetable origin. The samples of Milk as usual furnished the largest proportion of adulteration, as 3 out of the 8 were adulterated, one to the extent of 18 per cent. and the others of 7 and 8 per cent. two also were poor, the total solids being just under 12 per cent.; there was not any adulteration except water. The whole of the samples of Cocoa, except one, were sold as being a mixture of cocoa, arrowroot and sugar, the exception being a Cocoa Essence which was genuine, that is to say, pure Cocoa deprived of some of its fat. The quantity of starch in the other samples varied between 67 and 80 per cent. so that, allowing for the sugar there was not in some of them more than 10 per cent of Cocoa. Whether or not it is legal to sell as "Soluble Cocoa" an article containing only from 10 to 15 per cent. of Cocoa I am not prepared to say, but in my opinion it should be sold as "Arrowroot" flavoured 7 with Sugar and Cocoa. Of course an article like this is comparatively valueless as a food, as the quantity of Arrowroot used for making a cup of Cocoa would scarcely have greater nutritive value than a mouthful of bread and butter, whilst that of the Cocoa would be equally infinitesimal; one of the "Soluble Cocoas" contained as nearly as I could ascertain about 20 per cent of Cocoa, the others varying from 15 to 10 per cent. The two samples of Oatmeal were genuine, also the two of Mustard, but one was a mixture of about 50 per cent. of flour with a little tumeric and cayenne. My certificate was objected to, as the vendor asserted that the Mustard was genuine, but on being analysed by another analyst, nominated by the vendor and approved by me, my analysis was found to be correct, the defendant was therefore fined 5s. and costs and had to pay his analyst's fee. I remain, Gentlemen, Obediently Yours, JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Public Analyst for the Hackney District. Received and ordered to be printed, JOHN KELDAY, Chairman. June 13th, 1879, Board of Works for the Backney District. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1878, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., ETC., Secretary of the Metcrological Society, Vice-Prcsident of the Society of Public Analysts, &c., Author of numerous essays on Sanitary Statistics, &c., MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE DISTRICT. LONDON: A. T. ROBERTS, SON & CO., STEAM PRINTERS 5, HACKNEY ROAD. 1879. REPORT FOR THE YEAR, 1878. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, I regret to have to report a death-rate for this year which is somewhat above the average, viz.: 20.2 per 1000 inhabitants, against 19.9 for the eight years, 1871-78, and 20.4 for the ten years, 1861-71; but the increase was not so large as that for all London, where the death-rate was 23.5 against 22.7 for the previous seven years. The excess in Hackney, was due partly to small-pox, but chiefly to diarrhoea, arising from the hot weather; to whooping cough and scarlet fever, as well as to a very slight extent from typhoid and other fevers. The increase from small-pox was not large as there were 86 deaths from this cause, against an average of 83 for the ten years, 1868-77; but as this period includes the excessive mortality of 1871-72 (511 deaths) the average is far above the mean of the last twenty years. Scarlet fever caused 123 deaths against an average of 93, but this was scarcely to be wondered at because it was the year during which the disease was expected to prevail, as four years had elapsed since it was epidemic in this district. Whooping cough also was very fatal, as no less than 135 deaths were registered from this cause, against an average of 77. In this respect we were no worse off than the rest of London, as a larger proportion of deaths from this disease was registered in London than for any other year since the Registration of Deaths was commenced. The mortality from diarrhoea was also greater than at any period since the cholera epidemic, so that it is no wonder a 1 4 that our death-rate was 0.3 per 1000 (i.e., 3 per 10,000 population) above the mean of the eight years, 1871-78. The few extra deaths from "fevers" did not appreciably influence the death-rate, as the excess was but small. Amongst the deaths from 'fever' was one registered as 'typhus' which is very rare in this district. I, therefore, made enquiries as to its origin, and found that it was an imported case, the patient not being a resident, but he was brought home ill and died here. A careful examination was also made of the means of drainage, water supply, and general sanitary condition of every house in which patients, suffering from typhoid fever had lived, and also as to the milk supply, and I may say, to a considerable extent, with negative results. In several cases it was found that the word 'typhoid' was not used as synonymous with 'enteric fever,' but as indicating a secondary fever arising in the course of an inflammatory disease of the lungs or other organs. The results of the enquiries may be briefly enumerated as follows:—We received information of 93 cases in 73 houses, either through the Registrar's returns, the relieving Officers, or from persons requiring disinfection of their premises and bedding. In seven houses, in which two or more cases happened, there were defects in the drainage or water supply apparatus of two only, the disease having apparently spread from one person to another in the same way as scarlet fever or small-pox, and in four out of the seven there was evidence to show that the disease was imported. In one house, where the drains and water supply apparatus were not defective, there were seven cases, which occurred in the following order. The father, after a short illness, showed decided symptoms or enteric fever on September 4th, and was nursed at home by his wife and eldest daughter. After an illness of 6 weeks he became convalescent, but shortly afterwards suffered from a relapse. A few days after his first convalescence his eldest daughter was attacked, then his wife, and subsequently the other children, the last showing premonitory symptoms on November 6th. All except the father were removed to the Fever 5 Hospital, at Homerton, as soon as the early symptoms set in, and the bedding, &c., was disinfected. There was another family in the house, not one of whom contracted the disease. There was also a marked exemption as regards a child who was taken away by its grandfather on September 9 th, and who was not attacked, being the only member of the family who did not suffer from the disease. From the history of this and numerous other cases I have for many years been of opinion that enteric fever is contagious, although not in so great a degree as scarlet fever. Defects in the drains or water supply apparatus were found in about one-sixth only of the total number of houses in which the disease occurred. There was only one decided instance of infection by milk, viz.:—where the inmates of two institutions, one in Hackney and the other not, were attacked simultaneously with the disease. They were both supplied by the same milkman who had the disease in his house. On making a strict enquiry into this case I ascertained that the person in charge of the sick had on one occasion, about a fortnight before the disease appeared, measured out the milk sent to these institutions, having left the sick room for that purpose. As regards the severe epidemic, and great loss of life from whooping cough, I have to repeat the statement made in my last report that the disease rarely proves fatal if sufficient care be used in keeping the child in an uniform atmosphere during the inflammatory stage; if proper medical treatment be adopted during this stage; and if due supervision be exercised in preventing too early an exposure to cold air. The manner in which children, suffering from whooping cough, are exposed in the open air, even in winter, to their own manifest injury, and with very great risk to children with whom they are brought into contact, but who have not suffered from it, is most reprehensible and should in all instances be discouraged and, if possible, punished. The number of deaths from diarrhœa this year, in all London, as well as in this district, has attracted much attention, especially amongst those who consider the prevalence of infantile 6 diarrhœa to be a marked evidence of bad sanitary conditions. I have, therefore, carefully gone over the death registers for some years past and find that a large proportion of the deaths have occurred in West Hackney Registration District, some in the better class of houses, and others in the smaller. As the per centage cannot be worked out in consequence of our want of knowledge of the number of inhabitants in the different localities, I can only say at present that the whole district has not suffered so much as all London. This is shown by the following calculations. Deaths from diarrhoea under 1 year per 100,000 inhabitants. YEAR. LONDON. HACKNEY. 1876 64.2 62.2 1877 34.7 26.9 1878 57.6 53.1 This disease is most fatal in hot weather, as in Hackney 86 per cent. of the deaths in 1876, happened during the 10 warmest weeks of the year; 68 per cent. in the corresponding period of 1877, when the summer was unusually cold; and 73 per cent. in 1878, when the summer was mostly warm. This subject I propose working out more fully in a subsequent report. As Hackney was one of the parishes which was attacked with small pox at an early period of the epidemic, it was only to be expected that it should be one amongst those from which it should depart earliest, and so it has proved, for whilst Greenwich and other places on the south side of the river have suffered severely during the autumnal and winter months of 1878.79, this district has been almost entirely free from it for some time past. The number of deaths in 1878 was 86, against 179 in 1877, and 92 in 1876, giving a death.rate of 52 per 100,000 population in 1878, against 112 in 1877, and GO in 1876. In all London the death.rates per 100,000 population were 21 in 1876, 72 in 1877, and 40 in 1878. so that up to the end of 1878, Hackney had suffered more than the Metropolis at large in the 7 proportion of 224 to 133 per 100,000 population, but before the end of the epidemic the difference will most probably not be so great. There is one question of considerable moment which naturally arises out of those statistics, viz.:—to what extent, if any, the presence of the Small-pox Hospital in our midst has acted as a cause for the severity of the outbreak? To this I would reply that in 1871 there was evidence to show that the population, near the hospital, suffered more than in other parts of the district, and the same obtained in 1876-78; but the inhabitants of the same streets were not attacked in the same ratio in the two epidemics, as those who were living in some of the adjacent streets suffered more severely in 1877-78 than in 1871-2. Again the disease first broke out in the district amongst persons who were in communication with, or in attendance on those who had contracted the disease outside the district, and it is certain that isolation of the sick very materially prevented the spreading of the disease. There is also another difficulty, viz.:—that we are not informed of every case as we should be if the registration of infectious diseases were made compulsory, so that our returns are very imperfect. There is another matter of considerable interest, viz.:—whether or not we should have been in a better position with a hospital for non-pauper patients. My opinion is that we should not as there would have been in many cases a question as to which hospital patients should be sent, and valuable time would consequently have been lost. Further, whenever there is a choice of hospitals, application would be made to the officers having the power to send patients to the particular hospital, which the patients or their friends preferred, without regard to the claim they had on one rather than on the other. Besides this the cost and trouble would have been very much greater, without any corresponding advantage, for so far as 1 know, everyone was removed to a hospital who would go there. A few were taken to the Islington hospital at the expense of the patients' friends, and in no case was it necessary for me to send a case at the cost 8 of this board, although I was empowered to remove all non. paupers who were without proper lodging and accommodation, and were unable to pay for themselves. It is true that the Poor Law Orders have been liberally interpreted in this district, so that servants and others living in a similar capacity with inhabitants, were removed "as being sick and having no home." That this is the true interpretation of the Poor Laws was stated by the President of the Local Government Board, in my presence, in reply to two deputations which waited upon him on this subject. It was, therefore, clearly no part of the duty of this Board to have provided hospitals for servants and others having no home of their own, and with but small, if any funds at their disposal. The present plan of removal by the relieving officers seems the best possible, as they live in their respective districts, and are consequently more accessible than one official for the whole district would be. It would, however, be a great boon if the certificate of any qualified medical practitioner could be legally made equivalent to a certificate from a Poor Law Medical Officer. Table I.

It is, therefore, very probable that other districts of London which have not as yet suffered, will be visited by the disease unless vaccination and re-vaccination have been effectually carried out. Having discussed at considerable length in my report for 1876, the protective power of vaccination and re-vaccination, when properly performed, I do not propose dwelling at greater length on this subject at present. The total number of cases reported to the Sanitary Department during the year was 342, against 670 in 1877, of which 322 were removed in 1877, to hospitals, chiefly those of the Asylum Board, against 207 in 1878. We had applications from several persons in a fair position of life for the use of the ambulance, but not one for providing hospital accommodation for nonpauper cases. There were a few instances in which persons not having proper lodging and accommodation at first refused to go to the Asylum Board's Hospitals, but on being threatened with compulsory removal under a magistrate's order they all agreed to be removed, and subsequently made application to the Relieving Officers. The number of cases which were reported to us in the different sub-divisions of the district are shown in the following table, but I cannot give the per centage to population as there is no separate census of the sub-divisions. It will be seen that we had notice of a few cases only in De Beauvoir Town and Stamford Hill sub-divisions, but this might have been expected to a certain extent, as there are but few poor in those localities, and consequently comparatively few of that class concerning whom we receive such information. 19 Table II.

The following list of articles, disinfected at the disinfecting chamber of the Board during the year, were received from;329 houses in which small-pox or other infectious diseases had occurred, and the result of the disinfection is very satisfactory, for except when the disease re-appeared within the incubative period no second case occurred in the same house.

Against this amount of £114 2s. 2d. has to be credited the sum of £30 10s. 6d., received for disinfection from those who could afford to pay. In addition to this expenditure there were £42 1s. 7d. paid for disinfectants used for the gullies, urinals, and offensive accumulations. The same men were employed in disinfecting the gullies which are estimated at 2400 in number; in removing and burying dead cats and dogs thrown on the streets and waste ground, fish offal and other offensive matter, and also in cleansing and tarring the urinals. The whole of the disinfection of articles of clothing, and the fumigation of rooms were carried out under the supervision of Mr. Thomas, Inspector of Nuisances, no part of whose salary is included in the cost of disinfection, and the time occupied by the men in other work than disinfection was deducted from their whole time, so that all their wages is not placed to the disinfection account. Having briefly referred to the mortality from diarrhœa,enterie fever and small.pox, I shall now discuss the general statistics of the district, including the population, the births and deaths, as well as the special diseases by which the deaths were caused.

The great activity amongst builders in this district is well shown by the number of applications made to the Board for permission to drain new houses into the sewers, viz.:—1542 applications in the three years between April 1, 1872, and March 31, 1875; and as many as 3,386 or more than double for the three years 1875-78, making a total of 4,928 in six years. If this number be multiplied by 6.5, which is the smallest allowance we can make for inhabitants per house, we obtain 32,532 or about 5,500 increase per annum. I have, therefore, added on an additional number of inhabitants for these years as compared with former periods. To show that the numbers given in the above table are correct I would direct your attention to the birth rates, which were, when calculated on the increased population, higher for the three years, 1876-78, than for 1873-75. The death-rate also supports this calculation as may be seen by referring to Table X., and by making a comparison between the mortality for Hackney and for all London during these periods. The density of population is also rapidly increasing as there are now 42.5 persons per acre, against 29.6 in 1809. As this density is calculated on the total area of the district, and as there are 568 acres of water, open spaces and commons in this district, which cannot be built upon, the real density of population is much greater; indeed it has been ascertained by a census of parts of the district that in some places there are above 200 inhabitants per acre, and the mortality in these localities is, as might be expected, much above the average, and therefore materially assists in keeping up our deathrate in spite of the strict sanitary supervision exercised in these 15 13 localities. The births have increased in the 10 years from 3,913 in 1869, to 5,9.10 in 1873, and the deaths from 2,520 to 3,392; the proportion of births to population in 1869 being 33.7 per 1,000 inbabitants, against 35.6 in 1878. The number of marriages increased in 1875 from 1271 to 1415, and again in 1877 to 1485, but decreased in 1878 to 1441. Table IV. Quarters. Stoke Newington Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney.

The largest number was registered in Hackney Sub-District, viz.: 2122, which is equal to 35.7 per cent. of the whole; 1448 in South Hackney, or 24.4 per cent.; 1294 in West Hackney, or 21.8 per cent.; 779 in Stoke Newington, or 13.1 per cent; and in Stamford Hill only 297, or 50 per cent. The percentage has very largely increased in Stoke Newington during the last seven years, having been 13.1 in 1878 against 7.6 in 1871. The number of births registered in Stoke Newington was 316 in 1871, and 779 in 1878, so that there were more than twice as many in 1S78 as in 1871. There has also been a slightly augmented per centage in the Stamford Hill Sub-District, and a decreased per centage in all the others. The total number of births has increased in all the Sub-districts, but not to so considerably great an extent as in Stoke Newington so that the per centages are smaller. 14 Table V. 1878.—Deaths in each Sub-District.

The numbers registered in the Sub-Districts are as follows:—in Hackney, 1474; in South Hackney, 769; in West Hackney, 667; in Stoke Newington, 342; and in Stamford Hill, 140. I have not calculated the per centages of deaths in the SubDistricts because of the large number of public institutions in the Hackney Sub-District, which renders it almost impossible to do so with any degree of accuracy, especially as there has also been a very large increase in the number of houses, and consequently of inhabitants in some Sub-Districts, whilst there has been but comparatively little in others. Of course it would be an easy task to ascertain the number of deaths in the population of the various institutions, and distribute them pro rato over the other Sub-Districts, but from the other movements of the population a correct calculation cannot be made of the death-rate for each. 15 Table VI.

The total number of deaths under one year was 858, or 25.3 per cent. of the whole, which is somewhat above the average for the ten years 1866-75. This large rate of infantile deaths arises, to a considerable extent, from the large proportion of infants to the remainder of the population, and not to an excessive number of deaths under 1 year to births, as in this year there were 145 deaths of infants under one year to each 1,000 births against 143 in 1861-70; 144 in 1877; and 164 for all London in 1878. There were 550 deaths, or 16.2 per cent. between 1 and 5 years; 165, or 4.9 per cent. between 5 and 15; 192, or 16 5.7 per cent. between 15 and 25; 198, or 5.8 per cent. between 25 and 35; 255, or 7.5 per cent. between 35 and 45; 249, or 7.3 per cent. between 4.5 and 55; 300, or 8.9 per cent. between 55 and 65; 325, or 9.5 per cent. between 65 and 75; 238, or 7.0 per cent. between 75 and 85; and 64, or 1.9 above 85 years of age. The death-rate from constitutional maladies was rather below the average, owing probably to the excess from zymotic diseases. The group of constitutional diseases includes cancer, scrofulous, and tubercular affections, such as consumption, water on the brain, &c. The next group of local diseases, contains affections of various organs of the body, and caused 619 deaths; of which 122 were registered from inflammation of the brain, 104 from apoplexy, 60 from paralysis, 110 from convulsions, 226 from heart disease, 373 from bronchitis, 171 from pneumonia or inflammation of the substance of the lungs, 67 from affections of the liver and stomach, and 73 from kidney diseases, as well as other deaths in smaller numbers from affections of the joints, &c. There were 423 deaths from developmental diseases, or 12.5 per cent. of the whole. Under this heading are included 169 deaths from premature birth and debility, 23 from child-birth, 130 from old age, and 66 from dropsy and debility. There were 70 deaths from violence including accidents, suicide and murder, or manslaughter. The deaths above 80 years of age occurred as follows: 26 between 80 and 81; 21 between 81 and 82; 17 between 82 and 83; 14 between 83 and 84; 19 between 84 and 85; 11 between 85 and 86; 11 between 86 and 87; 12 between 87 and 88; 8 between 88 and 89; 3 between 89 and 90. There were also 16 deaths above 90 years of age, viz.: 3 between 90 and 91; 1 between 91 and 92; 1 between 92 and 93; 3 between 93 and 94; 3 between 94 and 95; 4 between 96 and 97; and 1 between 99 and 100 years of age. The number of infantile deaths from suffocation in bed was large, viz.: 17, which is much to be regretted, as it indicates either drunkenness or carelessness, or both, and I fear in some cases something worse. 17 Table VII.

This group of diseases differs from those contained in the Registrar General's Reports as they were framed in accordance with a resolution of the Society of Medical Officers of Health. The zymotic death-rate as before stated was unusually high in consequence of whooping cough, scarlet fever, small-pox and diarrhoea being prevalent during the same year, which is very unusual, and may not happen again for several years. The deaths from tubercular affections were in the ordinary proportion for this district, viz.:—2-90 per 1,000 inhabitants, but the mortality from acute pulmonary affections, viz., bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy, and laryngitis was in excess of the ordinary rate owing to the early and severe winter of 1878-79. Convulsive diseases of infants were rather below, whilst wasting diseases of infants produced a little more than their ordinary mortality. As the diseases included in these groups are enumerated in a foot note to the table I need not recapitulate them. The mortality from these maladies was 13.12 per cent. of the total deaths in 1878, against 12.20 in 1877. b 18 Table VIII. 1868-1878.—Deaths from the principal Infectious Diseases and dlarrhœa—52 weeks in each YEAR, HaCKNEY.

It will be seen that, as compared with the ten years, 1868-77, the death-rate per 10,000 inhabitants in 1878 from small-pox was 5.2 against 6.0; from measles, 1.9 against 13.6; scarlet fever, 7.2 against 6.8; diphtheria, 1.4 against 1.1; whooping cough, 8.1 against 5.6; fever, 4.2 against 3.8, and diarrhoea 9.4, against 18.6, the total being 37.4 against 35.5, so that whooping cough alone caused a mortality above the average, which amounts to more than the total excess. These deaths are the more to be regretted as whooping would rarely prove fatal if due care were taken not to expose the sufferers to cold air, and proper medical advice procured. It will be seen that scarlet fever was unusually prevalent here in 1869 and 1870; in 1874, and in 1878, according to its ordinary period of recurrence; whilst small pox was almost absent except in 1871.72, and in 1876-77 and 78. That measles prevailed in 1869, 1874 and 1877; whilst with the exceptions of 1871, when comparatively few deaths occurred, the mortality from fever varied within but narrow limits. The largest number of deaths from diarrhœa, were registered in 1873 and 1878. The table also shows that the number of deaths in London from these causes oscillated very considerably during these years. As I have already pointed out the death-rates from different diseases, I need not dwell much upon the table IX, which shows the percentages of deaths from 12 groups of diseases. The first shows that the mean death-rate from those maladies, which are termed zymotic by the Registrar General, but which include not only all infectious diseases, but rheumatism and deaths by privation and alcohol, has varied but little since 1856, when periods of several years are taken. Thus in 1856-65, the B 1 20 percentage of deaths from these causes was 20.80 of the total mortality from all causes; in 1866.75, 20.42; and in 1871-78, 20.44; having varied in the last 8 years between 17.1 and 28.4. As regards diseases of uncertain seat the proportions were 4.84, 4.69 and 4.28; but I am glad to find that tubercular affections have not caused so large a proportion of deaths during the last 8 years as previously, for in 1856-65 it was 16.77; in 1866-75, 16.52; and in 1871-78 only 15.40; but the deaths from premature birth and atrophy have increased from 4.89 in 1856-65 to 6.45 in 1866-75, and to 6.82 in 1871.78. This might have been expected as the mortality amongst children of the poor during the first year of life is more than double that amongst infants of the upper and middle classes. The table also shows that deaths from affections of the nervous system are on the increase, viz.: from 12.18 in 1856.65 and 12.09 in 1866-75 to 12.60 in 1871.78. This was most marked in 1876.78, when the rate was 13.2, and was chiefly caused by the large number of deaths of aged people returned as from brain disease " during the last three years. The proportionate mortality from affections of the respiratory organs has also been raised from 16.39 in 1856, and 16.64 in 1866-75 to 17.94 in 1871-78, chiefly from their great fatality in 1875, when the weather was very cold. The other groups of diseases do not require any special mention. The column of the mean yearly temperature shows within what small limits this ranges, as in 1856-65 the mean was 49.5; in 1866.75, 49.°5; and in 1871-78, 49.°6; the highest yearly mean temperature having occurred in 1872, when it was 50.°7, and the lowest in 1871, when it was 48.°7. The mean yearly rainfall was 23.2 inches in 1856-65; 25.0 inches in 1866.75; and 25.4 inches in 1871.78; the largest total fall in 1871.78 having been in 1872, when it reached 30.0 inches; the next greatest in 1878, when 29.2 inches were recorded; and the lowest in 1874, when only 20.0 inches were registered. These figures are taken from Mr. Glaisber's tables, 21 Table IX. Percentages of Deaths from various causes to total Deaths in Hackney from 1856 to 1878, arranged in 12 groups.

The deaths have not increased quite so fast, for in 1841-51 the mean number registered was 946; in 1851-61, it was 1391; in 1861-71 it amounted to 2182; and for the eight 22 years 1S71 it has reached the sum of 2869; as many as 3392 having been registered in 1878, or about 3½ times as many as in 1841-51. This alteration in the relation between the birth and death-rates has not arisen from a reduction in the death-rate, as in 1841-51 this was 19.18, and in the eight years 1871-8 it was 19.9, but from a considerable alteration in the social condition of the inhabitants, as there are now a much larger proportion of married people, and proportionately fewer servants than in 1841-51. This increase from 19.18 to 19.9 is much smaller than might have been expected, and has no doubt been kept down by the removal of nuisances, and other sanitary works which have been carried out ever since this Board was formed under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The proportion of inhabitants who have died from infectious diseases has increased during this period in nearly the same ratio, but not quite, as the deaths from all causes, which may be shown by multiplying the death-rate per 1000 from seven chief zymotic diseases by five so as to obtain the death rate per 5000 inhabitants, when we get 17.80 for 1851-61 against 18.05 in 1871-78. As however, there have been two very severe epidemics of small pox since 1871 in this district,and as the deaths of inhabitants suffering from small pox which occurred in hospitals outside the district were not included in the tables as zymotic deaths before 1871, although they were allowed for as "deaths in hospitals" the statistics are not quite comparable. It is, therefore, evident that if the mortality from small pox had been included previously to 1871, the death-rate from zymotic diseases would have been decidedly below that of any previous decennial period. The annual death-rate per 1000 inhabitants is gradually approximating to that of all London, as the district becomes more densely populated, and is inhabited by a larger proportion of the working classes Thus in 1841-51 the difference in favour of Hackney amounted to 5.40 deaths from all causes per 1000 population; in 1851-61 to 4.63 ; in 1861-71 to 4.06; and in 1871-78 to 2.90, so that for the 10 years 1871-81 it will probably be under 3.0 per 1000 inhabitants. If it should 23 only amount to this, we shall have good reason to be satisfied, as a large number of the newly built houses are occupied by members of the labouring classes, who have come from the more densely populated parts of London, amongst whom the mortality is much greater, and especially amongst young children, than those who formerly constituted the great bulk of the Hackney population.

Copies of these regulations were distributed to all the cowkeepers, and successful opposition was made at the Sessions against all who omitted or neglected to comply with them. We objected at Great Prescot Street to 23 applications for renewals, and to one application for a new license, as well as to 3 applications for renewals at Tottenham Petty Sessions. The whole of these were adjourned, and, eventually, all the cowkeepers excepting two complied with our requirements, so that two licenses only were refused. A copy of these regulations was included in the Board's report for 1877-78. In the early part of 1879 an order in Council was issued under the provisions of the Contagious Diseases Animals Act, 1878, requiring the Local Authorities throughout Great Britain to open a register for the registration of all persons carrying on the business of a cowkeeper, dairyman, or purveyor of milk, and to revise the same from time to time. The Metropolitan Board of Works being the Local Authority for the Metropolis, except the City of London, issued advertisements requiring these persons to give notice to them during the month of March, so as to be placed on the register. These regulations do not take away the authority of this Board or its officers, as the powers conferred under the Metropolis Local Management Act Amendment are not repealed by the statute. The order also empowers the Local Authorities, in addition to supervising the cowsheds, to issue regulations forbidding the admixture of milk from diseased cows with other milk; for preventing persons suffering, or who have recently suffered from an infectious disease, assisting in any way in the conduct of any of the above-named trades; and also makes it unlawful to use a 25 milk store or milk shop for any purpose incompatible with the proper preservation of the milk, or to use any milk vessels which are likely to cause contamination of the milk. The penalty for neglect is a sum not exceeding £20, and will, doubtless, if enforced as occasion may arise, prevent many of the objectionable practices which have hitherto prevailed. During the year the Metropolitan Board of Works were successful in passing an Act of Parliament for making considerable alterations and amendments in the Building Act. Amongst other things they are empowered to make bye-laws respecting the foundations and sites of houses to be constructed after the passing of the Act, and as to the manner in which the foundations and sites shall be made, found, excavated, filled up, prepared, and completed for securing stability of the buildings, and for purposes of health. Also as to the description and quality of the substances of which the walls are to be constructed for the prevention of fires, and for purposes of health. They are also empowered to issue regulations for other purposes not connected with sanitary matters, which I need not enumerate. I gave evidence on behalf of the Metropolitan Board, as to the necessity for some such regulations as these, because in my opinion many unhealthy dwellings are being and have been erected in this District. Under this power the Metropolitan Board has issued a comprehensive and strict set of regulations forbidding buildings being erected on made ground if the deposit contained any fcecal, animal, or vegetable matter, or if it consisted of dust or similar refuse, unless the same be removed and the site tilled up with brick rubbish or like material. Also requiring that a layer of concrete, six inches thick, should be laid over the whole site; that mortar of good quality, made with clean sand or grit and lime, should be used; and that the concrete should be composed of clean gravel, or broken hard brick and lime. Also that every wall of a house shall have a damp proof course throughout its whole thickness, one foot above the level of the ground if there be a basement, and one foot above the base of the wall if there be no 20 basement. As considerable opposition has been manifested by builders before the Secretary of State, there is almost certain to be some modifications made in the regulations, as proposed by the Metropolitan Board. An important Bill for the improvement of Torrens' Act has been introduced into Parliament this Session, and is likely to become Law. This Bill, the Artizan's Dwellings A.ct, (1S6S), Improvement Bill, was fully considered and reported upon by the Sanitary Committee, and the Report when brought it having been accepted by this Board and ordered to be printed, I need not allude to it any further, except by saying that if carried, it will considerably facilitate the shutting up and pulling down of houses in small blocks which are unfit for habitation, but which cannot be dealt with under a Scheme by the Metropolitan Board of Works. There are some small blocks of buildings in this District which might advantageously be demolished under the provisions of this Bill if it should become law. A copy of the Sanitary Committee's Report will be found bound up with the yearly report issued by the Board. The arrangements for the removal of dust were carried out as usual under the superintendence of the Sanitary Department, the number of loads being somewhat below that of the previous year, but larger than in 1876, the total number being 18,129 in 1878 against 18,623 in 1877, and 17,867 in 1876. The total number removed by Mr. Iszard from No. 2, or the SouthEastern division was 9313 against 9,633 in 1877, and by Mr. Larter, 8816 against 8,990 in 1877, which diminution was probably owing to greater strictness having been observed as regards the removal of garden rubbish and trade refuse, which we have for years past objected to take away. The cost for cartage was £2453. 14s. 9d., and the sum paid for wages, £552. 3s. 6d., which with the Inspector's salary of £81. 5s. Od. makes £633. Ss. Od. for wages and salaries. In addition to these charges were £117 for the hire of carts; £7. 18s. for new shovels and ladders; and £12. 4s. 6d. for new baskets and repairs. These 27 sums make a total of £3224. 5s. 9d., from which, however, has to be deducted £185. 0s. 5d. for dust which has been sold from No. 1 division, leaving a total of £3039. 5s. 4d. as the net cost for the year. The number of dust complaints during the year were not large, viz., 2030, especially when it is considered that these included all requests to have the dust removed without any complaint having been made against the men for its non-removal. There are many persons in the District who will not place a D card in their windows, but prefer writing to or applying at the Town Hall whenever they desire their dust to be taken away. It is, therefore, evident that the plan of having the house refuse removed at a fixed sum per load under my direction, and the superintendence of the Dust Inspector, answers very well in this District, especially as by this plan and by the system of check employed, we do not pay for more than the value of the work done, as, doubtless, was often the case under the old contract system for clearing the District at a lump sum. The mortuary has been of considerable service during this as well ns in former years, as 59 dead bodies were deposited therein, many being removed from premises let out to different families, and in some instances where the whole family had but one room for living and sleeping in. This number is not quite so great as in 1877, in consequence of fewer deaths from small pox. The disinfecting chamber has also assisted us indirectly, in consequence of numerous applications from respectable persons (who had their own private medical attendant), for the disinfection of bedding and clothing, concerning whose cases we should have remained ignorant if we had not had this chamber. The number of nuisances abated during the year was 5912, being rather below the average of the three preceding years, which, most probably, arose from the large number of summonses issued against persons neglecting to carry out works necessary to abate nuisances, during the years 1877 and 1878, viz.: 79 in 1877, and 83 in 1878. The number of choked drains which have been cleansed and repaired, or reconstructed, was 28 siderably less than in 1877, viz.: 605 against 743, and it is to be hoped that as many old and defective drains have for several years past been re-constructed, that the number of choked drains in future will be somewhat diminished; but as a large proportion of these nuisances result from carelessness of servants and other occupiers of houses, especially amongst the poor, we must expect the number from this cause to remain nearly the same. The total number of nuisances arising from defective drainage, viz., 1152, was less than in 1877 by 228; and of nuisances from want of whitewashing, cleansing and repairing, 2061; from badly paved and drained yards, 484; of broken and unpaved dust bins, 418; and of defective water supply apparatus, ] 82, making a total of 3200 nuisances arising from defects in houses and their adjuncts. There were 697 houses disinfected; 36 overcrowding cases abated (some of these being instances of indecent overcrowding); 186 accumulations of stable dung, and other offensive matters; and 941 other nuisances not included under the above headings. In addition, the dwelling rooms in 163 houses were measured, and notices served limiting the number of occupiers in accordance with the provisions of the Sanitary Act and Amendment Act. Notices were also served in 697 houses, for disinfection of the whole or some of the rooms, in consequence of infectious diseases having appeared therein, and above 5000 notices of various kinds were served for the abatement of nuisances. The number of premises inspected during the year, many of them several times, was 8212, or nearly one third of all the houses in the District. The list of streets and other public places inspected in 1878 shows that the Inspectors visited, under the provisions of the Sanitary Act, 6104 houses, in which they found 9051 families consisting of 39,241 persons, occupying 26,200 rooms, or about one-and-a-half persons to each room. The rooms are undoubtedly small and low, many but little more than seven feet in height, and do not admit of much overcrowding without considerable injury to health, so that the 29 regulations under the Sanitary Act, as to the requisite cubical space for each resident, are as far as possible strictly carried out. The Inspectors make a return for each house, as to the condition of each room, and of the staircases and passages; the state of the roof, whether watertight or not; as to the drainage of the water closet, yard, and premises generally; as to the water supply and apparatus; the paving of the yard; the state of the dust bin, and any other matter requiring notice. Amongst these 6104 houses there were found 2403 which were defective as regards one or more sanitary necessities, or which were so dirty or dilapidated as to be injurious to health. This, which is about the proportion found in these houses every year, shows the necessity for a regular annual house to house inspection, as complaints are rarely received except as regards choked or defective drains, or accumulations of stable manure, deposits of offensive matters, or filthy urinals. The total number of complaints as to nuisances received during the year was 587, which gave only about one tenth part of the total number of nuisances abated in 187S, which I consider to be decidedly satisfactory. The number of houses reported to me as having had cases of infectious diseases therein was 769, of which 433 happened amongst the 6104 houses regularly visited every year, and 336 in houses of a better class. There were 326 houses in which small pox occurred against 670 in 1877 ; 204 where scarlet fever appeared; 76 in which typhoid fever was reported, (some of them were not enteric but irritative fever) ; 69 where there was simple continued fever; and 14 diphtheria. The largest number of small pox cases, in proportion to the number of houses, occurred in Nesbitt Street, Homerton, and Victoria Road, Hackney Wick. The meteorology of the year was somewhat unusual, in consequence of the high temperature in nearly all the months except November and December, when the weather was unusually cold. In January and February the temperature was more than deg. Fahr. in excess of the mean; was also in excess by more 30 than 2 deg. in April, May, and June; but it was below the average by nearly half a degree in September; by more than 2½ degrees in November; and 51 degrees in December. The lowest temperature recorded was not so low in December as in many other years, but the weather was remarkable for the long continuance of frost, and especially, we may add, for the continued cold experienced in the early part of the present year. The rainfall was also unusual, owing not only to the total fall,— 29 inches at Greenwich, and nearly 27 inches at my house in the Richmond Road, but also to the excessive amount which fell on several occasions, when the sewers of Hackney were over.charged, and some of the streets, as well as many houses were flooded. Thus on April 10th and 11th, the enormous fall of 2.55 inches was registered at my house; on June 13th, there fell 1.015 inches; on the 30th, 1.035 inches; on August 3rd, 1.180 inches; and on the 27th, as much as 1.460 inches, making a total of 6.910 inches on five occasions. A fall of 2.220 inches occurred in Hackney between 8 p.m. on the 10th April, and 9 a.m. on the 11th, and 0.33 inches fell between 9 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. on the 11th, thus making the total of 2.55 inches above mentioned in 16½ hours, so that it is no wonder that the main sewers were overcharged. A rainfall in London amounting to 2 inches in one day is so rare that only five instances have been recorded at Greenwich, including that of April 10th—11th, since 1815. These happened on February 7th, 1831, when 2.89 inches fell; on August 22nd, 1843, when 2.16 inches were registered; on July 15th, 1853, when there were 2.63 inches; and on July 26th, 1867, when as much as 3.67 inches were recorded. On this occasion the sewers overflowed in Hackney, as the chief part of the rain fall took place in a comparatively short time, the total being only 2.28 inches against 3.67 inches at Greenwich. A rainfall exceeding 1 inch in a day rarely happens more often than once a year on this side of London, and so far as I know has not recently occurred more than three times in one year, viz., in 1865, so that these five 31 falls may be looked upon as almost unprecedented. There was also a terrific storm of rain, wind and lightning on July 11th, 1874, when not only the low lying parts of Hackney were flooded, but many others; the fall on this occasion, in about two hours, was nearly 2 inches. I cannot give the precise measurement as the rain gauge had not been emptied for some days before. As my rain-gauge, to prevent accidents, is placed on a wall nearly 6 feet high, the amount registered was somewhat less than it would have been if placed, as usual, 4 inches above ground. I cannot conclude this Report without stating that the Inspectors have carried out their duties to my satisfaction. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN W.
