London: PRINTED BY FREDERICK SHAW & Co., Dockhead, S.E. 1894. ANNUAL REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE VESTRY OF BERMONDSEY. Mr. Chairman And Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of submitting my Eighteenth Annual Report on the state of the Public Health in the Parish of Bermondsey. It includes the registration year of 52 weeks that ended on the 30th day of December, 1893. Small-pox reappeared in several parts of th Parish, but did not spread to any extent. It was generally of a mild form. Fifty-five cases were notified during the first three quarters of the year. There were no cases during the last quarter. There were no deaths from small-pox in the Parish, but 4 deaths took place in hospitals. Scarlet fever was prevalent throughout the year. The number of cases reported was 563. There were 14 deaths in the Parish and 16 in hospitals. Diphtheria was more fatal than in any previous year. There were 201 cases reported; 46 deaths in the Parish, and 19 in hospitals. In addition to these, the Registrar- General includes membranous croup with diphtheria. One case was reported as typhus. It was a child aged 6 years. The sanitary condition of the house was good. There was no overcrowding, or any known history of contagion. The disease did not spread. Influenza caused 16 deaths against 39 in the previous year. In all these cases there were complications of various inflammatory affections of the respiratory organs. The total deaths occurring in Bermondsey were 63 more than in 1892, and a still larger increase of deaths of parishoners took place in outlying institutions. The year was remarkable for an unprecedented duration of hot and dry weather. Drought prevailed from the beginning of March to the end of June. The rainfall measured less than one inch in the course of 110 consecutive days, and the total rainfall during the year was nearly 5 inches below the average. POPULATION. The revised census tables show that in April, 1891, there were 11,152 inhabited houses in the Parish, being an increase of 69 since the census of 1881. The number of uninhabited houses was 582, being an increase of 167. There were 30 houses in the course of erection, being a decrease of 42. The total number of persons was 84,682; males, iv 42,425, females, 42,257. The total decrease in the population during 10 years was 1970; of males, 838, of females, 1132. The Leather Market Registration District contained 2,127 inhabited houses, and 14,952 persons. The diminution of population in this district was 1348. In St. Mary Magdalen District there were 2055 inhabited houses, and 15,660 persons. In this case the reduction in the number of persons was only 9. In St. James' District there were 6,970 inhabited houses and 54,070 persons, the latter being a decline of 613. In Ward No. 1, there were 2116 inhabited houses, 14,870 persons, and 2,306 rated householders. In Ward No. 2,1967 houses, 15,326 persons, and 2,281 rated householders. In Ward No. 3, 4,119 houses, 32,549 persons, and 4,385 rated householders. In Ward No. 4, 2,950 houses, 21,937 persons, and 3,275 rated householders. In No. 3 Ward the population had declined by 1,862, and in No. 1 Ward by 544, while in No. 4 Ward there was an increase in the population of 428, and in No. 2 Ward of 8 persons. The Workhouse contained 449 special inmates and 27 officers. The average number of persons per house was 7.0 in Nos. 1 and 4 Wards; 7.7 in No. 2, and 7.9 in No. 3 Ward, and for the whole of the Parish 7.59. The population of the Ecclesiastical Parishes is given in Table 9. V The number of children under 5 years of age was 11,876, or 14.2 per cent. of the whole. Above 60 years of age there were 4,528 persons, or 5.3 per cent. The total number of tenements in the Parish was 19,033. The ratable annual value was £416,102 ; in 1881 it was £371,159. BIRTHS. The number of births recorded in the Parish was 3189, being 12 more than in the previous year. The annual birth-rate was 37.6 per thousand of the estimated population. The same rate in London was 310. The births in the Leather Market District numbered 533, being 68 fewer than in the previous year. In St. Mary Magdalen District there were 719 births, being an increase of 74, and in St. James' District, 1937, being a small increase of 6. The number of children born in the first quarter of the year was 873; in the second quarter 799; in the third quarter 742; and in the last quarter, 775. DEATHS. The number of deaths from all causes registered in Bermondsey was 1596. In addition to these there were 408 deaths in hospitals, asylums, and infirmaries outside the parochial boundaries. vi In the Leather Market District there were 313 deaths; in St. Mary Magdalen, 329, and in St. James' District 954. The number of deaths in the first quarter of the year was 415, in the second quarter 341, in the third quarter 347, and in the last quarter 493. The death-rate calculated on the deaths which took place in the Parish was 18.8 per thousand of the population, but when corrected for deaths in hospitals and outlying institutions, the rate of mortality is increased by 4.8. The number of parishioners dying in such institutions increases every year. The number of deaths of infants under 1 year of age, including deaths in hospitals, was 537, and the proportion of these deaths to 1000 registered births was 168. The death-rate in the Leather Market District calculated on the number of persons dying within the district was 20.9. In St. Mary Magdalen, 21.0, and in St. James', 17.6. These figures, however, are only useful for the purpose of comparison. The annual rate of mortality in London was 21.3, that of males being 23.0, and that of females 19 7. In Bermondsey, within the limits of the Parish, the death-rate of females exceeds that of males, but when hospital cases are included, the male deathrate is 2.0 higher than the female. The number of males dying in public institutions is nearly double vii that of the females. The cases in which inquests were held numbered 109, including 37 from violent causes. Fifty-nine deaths were uncertified, the majority of these being infants. CAUSES OF DEATH. From the chief diseases of the zymotic class 222 deaths were registered in the Parish; 29 in the first quarter, 49 in the second quarter, 88 in the third quarter, and 56 in the last quarter. The number of deaths from measles was 36, from scarlet fever, 14, from diphtheria the unprecedented number of 60, from whooping cough, 41, from fever, 5, from diarrhoea, 64, and from infantile cholera, 2. In addition to these there were in the hospitals, 4 deaths from small-pox, 16 from scarlet fever, 20 from diphtheria, including membranous croup, 5 from whooping ccugh, 4 from enteric fever, and 4 from diarrhoea. The total zymotic death-rate was 3.2 ; within the boundaries of the Parish it was 2 .6. In the class of septic diseases there were 6 deaths of infants from congenital syphilis, and 4 deaths from erysipelas. This is a very small proportion to the 190 cases notified, and seems to point out that many such cases are of a minor character, and it is very doubtful whether they are properly classed as infectious diseases. Three women died from puerperal septicaemia. There was 1 death from anthrax in the hospital. viii Seven persons (3 males and 4 females) died in the Parish from chronic alcoholic poisoning. Many deaths which are registered as due to diseases of the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys, are unquestionably due to the intemperate use of alcoholic stimulants. Rheumatism and rheumatic fever accounted for 9 deaths, 37 persons died from cancer (10 males and 27 females), besides 16 in hospitals. In the tubercular order of diseases there were 236 deaths, of which 20 were referred to tabes mesenterica, 49 to meningitis, 126 to phthisis, and 37 to tuberculosis. The hospital cases include 55 deaths from phthisis and 9 from tuberculosis. Premature birth was assigned as the cause of 66 deaths of infants, being a large increase of the number of the previous year, which was 46. Only 48 persons are said to have died simply from natural decay, but there were 30 more in infirmaries outside the Parish. From disease of the brain and nervous system 115 deaths occurred, of which 31 were due to apoplexy, 15 to paralysis, 3 to epilepsy, and 66 to convulsions. In the hospitals there were 18 deaths from disease of the brain and nervous system, including 2 from disease of the internal ear. ix Diseases of the heart and organs of circulation caused 77 deaths in the Parish, and 42 in outlying institutions. From disease of the respiratory system 554 deaths occurred in the Parish, and 106 in hospitals and infirmaries ; many of the latter were deaths of aged persons. There were 4 deaths from croup, and 15 from membranous croup, which is generally a form of diphtheria. Sixteen deaths were registered as laryngitis. The deaths from bronchitis numbered 249 within the Parish, and 34 outside, and those from pneumonia were 248 in Bermondsey and 34 outside. Disease of the stomach and bowels contributed 40 deaths, and those of the liver 16; the majority of the latter were from cirrhosis. From disease of the kidney and urinary organs there were 14 deaths. Eight women died from child-birth in the Parish and 2 in hospitals. This is in addition to the 3 deaths registered under the head of septicemia. In what is called the ill-defined class of general diseases, which are principally due to debility from birth or mal-nutrition of infants, there were 97 deaths, including 33 from marasmus. 26 from inanition, 21 from debility, 5 from general atrophy, 5 from malnutrition, and 1 from want of breast milk. The X last figure is an under statement of the number of deaths which are due to the artificial and in many cases improper hand-feeding of infants. The deaths attributed to violent causes numbered 34 in the Parish, and 27 in hospitals. They included fractures and contusions, 23, accidental suffocation of infants, 19 (of which 13 were females and 6 males), drowning, 2, burns and scalds, 11, of which 9 took place in hospitals. There were 6 cases of suicide, 4 by hanging, and 2 by poisoning. One death was attributed to irritation of the stomach through eating mussels, and another to the injudicious feeding of an infant with an excessive quantity of pure milk. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. During the year 1,082 certificates have been received. There were of cases of small-pox, 55, of scarlet fever, 563, of diphtheria, 201, of erysipelas, 190, of enteric fever, 44, of membranous croup, 24, of typhus, 1, continued fever, 1, and puerperal fever, 5. All the houses in these cases were inspected by the Sanitary staff, and disinfected either by the officers of the Vestry or to the satisfaction of the medical attendants. In many instances no sanitary defects were found on inspection. This was especially the case with regard to diphtheria, which is probably due to personal contact with persons suffering from the disease, and not to effluvia from sewage. xi The number of persons suffering from infectious diseases and removed to hospital was 448. Six hundred and seventy-four lots of bedding, consisting of 9,737 articles, were disinfected in the disinfecting chamber of the Vestry. SANITARY WORK. The fear of a possible invasion of cholera could scarcely increase the activity and zeal of your Sanitary Officers, but the possibility of that disease being introduced caused us to carry out a systematic re-inspection of what may be considered the weaker parts of the Parish. The number of houses and other premises inspected during the year ending Lady-day, 1894, was 10,914, and 9,211 notices were served for the execution of works which were deemed necessary to place them in a satisfactory sanitary condition. It may reasonably be expected that beneficial results will ultimately accrue from this work in other directions as well as in resisting an invasion of cholera. The number of houses found in a dirty and dilapidated condition was 1,620. These were cleansed and repaired. Nine hundred and five houses where infectious disease had prevailed were disinfected by officials of the Vestry, and 92 under the direction of the medical attendant. Sixty cases of overcrowding were abated, and 17 houses were closed as unfit for human habitation Nearly 1,300 closets were re-panned and trapped, and 680 supplied with water. More than 2,000 defective drains were re-constructed; 2,800 badly xii paved yards were repaired ; 400 roofs and 500 rainshoots were put in order. Eighty-six bakehouses were inspected. For providing the requisite means of ventilation of underground floors by the insertion of air bricks, proceedings were taken in 1,600 cases. In nearly 3,000 instances the water used for flushing water-closets was separated from that in use for other domestic purposes. Sixty animals and fowls were removed as being a nuisance. A large number of articles of food including beef, pork, fish, fowls and fruit were seized by the Sanitary Inspector and destroyed. Seventy dead bodies were removed from rooms to the mortuary provided by the Vestry; which also afforded accommodation for 89 postmortem examinations. A large number of factories and workshops were inspected and the owners or occupiers required to improve their sanitary condition. Thanking my fellow officers for the valuable assistance they are always willing to render, and the Vestry for the kind support given me during many years, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN DIXON, M.D., L.R.C.P. Lond., M.R.C.S., &c. Medical Officer of Health. 133, Jamaica Road, Bermondsey. xiii TABLE I. CAUSES OF DEATH. Registered in Bermondsey during the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1893.

I have personally inspected the 85 Bakehouses in the Parish, of these 51 are above ground and 34 under, 73 are in use '12 not used. All new Bakehouses in future should be erected above ground with the furnaces and coal holes outside, so as to keep the dust and fumes from the workpeople and mixing with the dough. Where necessary the floors have been concreted, and the walls from the floor to 12 inches above the troughs have been rendered with cement. The ventilation in several has been improved, the water supplied for mixing dough, direct from the main, regular cleansing of walls, floors and troughs have been insisted upon, several occupiers have been cautioned against sweeping refuse and storing lumber under the troughs. One hundred and fifty-two men and one woman are employed. This does not refer to Messrs. Peek, Frean & Co.'s Biscuit Factory, where between 1,500 and 2000 hands are employed. xxxix The whole of the Bakehouses are in a cleanly and wholesome condition. List of Bakehouses.

During the year ending June 19th, 189 t, 3494 houses have been inspected ; of these 20 were in my opinion in such a state and condition as to justify me in recommending them for registration, and 10 were by special resolution of the Board placed under the regulations : the owners of the other 10 took the necessary steps to comply with the requirements. The 20 houses recommended for registration contained 81 rooms, and were occupied by 47 families, consisting of 208 persons ; 39 rooms were overcrowded and deficient in the prescribed air space to the extent of 24897 cubic feet, showing an average deficiency of air space of 638 cubic feet each, Some of the houses were not overcrowded, but the floors were in such a dirty condition, and the proper cleansing of the houses altogether neglected, that the Board decided to place them under the regulations, thus rendering the landlords and lodgers liable to penalties if they failed to keep their houses clean and wholesome. During the year notices have been served for the abatement of overcrowding, the cleansing of passages, floors, wash-houses, waterclosets, and the remedying of other sanitary defects. Nearly the whole of these houses have a good supply of water direct from the main without the intervention of a cistern. The yards are well paved. The total number of houses now on the Register is 312, the same as last year. Ten houses have been registered, and 16 registered houses have been pulled down as unfit for human habitation. Three houses in Alderminster Road were pulled down for railway extension. Two in Long Walk, one in Bermondsey New Road as unfit for human habitation. One Summons was taken out under the Regulations, and a penalty inflicted of £5 and 19s. 6d. costs. The Registered Houses are in the following Streets : — Alexis Street 1 Abbey Street 9 Arnold's Place 1 Albion Place 2 Alice Street 2 Aberdour Street 5 Ambrose Street 3 Anchor Street 1 Bell Court 11 Bermondsey New Road 1 Bermondsey Square 1 Bermondsey Street (2 closed) 3 Bermondsey Wall 2 Brandon Street 1 Camperdown Place 4 Castles Buildings 1 Canal Row 1 Catlin Street 1 Chapel Place 2 Cherry Garden Street 3 Crosby Row 6 Crucifix Lane 1 Druid Street 3 Decima Street 2 East Lane 2 Elim Street 15 Fendall Street 1 Ferrand Street 4 Flockton Street 1 Foxlow Street 15 George's Court 1 The Grange 3 Grange Road 3 Grange Walk 6 Gedling Street 4 George Row 1 Green Walk 1 St. James' Road 1 xliv Javen's Buildings,Leroy Street, 3 blocks, 20 suites of rooms 3 Wood's Place 8 King's Arms Place 1 Kir by Street (1 closed) 6 Leroy Street 13 Lamb Alley 3 Larnaca Street 3 Long Lane 4 Long Walk 1 Lucey Road 1 Lockyer Street 2 Lynton Road 1 Marigold Court 9 Marigold Place 1 Marigold Street 4 Marshalls Place 4 Matilda Place 2 Medley's Place 2 Mellick's Place 7 Millstream Road 1 Minto Street 4 Napoleon Passage 2 Neckinger Street 2 Nelson Street 4 Osborne Buildings 1 Page's Walk 2 Parker's Buildings 5 Pleasant Place 1 Porlock Place 5 Paulin Street 1 Riley Street 1 Rouel Road 1 Russell Place 1 Salisbury Street 19 Salisbury Place 10 Ship and Mermaid Row 2 Snowsfields 3 Spa Road 3 Staple Street 5 Stevenson's Court 2 Suffolk Place 3 Tanner Street 2 Turner's Retreat 1 Vauban Street 2 Victoria Place 1 West Lane 5 West Grove 2 Weston Street 4 Wilderness Street 2 Williams Square 1 Wolseley's Buildings (8 } 8 Blocks) Wells Street 2 Woolf Street 2 Wylds Rents 1 West Street 1 HENRY THOMAS, Assoc. San. Inst., Chief Sanitary Inspector. FORTNIGHTLY REPORTS OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. January 16th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 7th day of January, 124 births and 75 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 38.0, and an annual rate of mortality of 23.0 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding deathrate in London was 26.4. The deaths from the chief diseases of the zymotic class were 2 from diphtheria and 1 from measles. From the diseases of the respiratory system there were 36 deaths, viz.: from bronchitis 21, pneumonia 13, asthma 1, and laryngitis 1. Tubercular diseases caused 15 deaths, including 12 from phthisis and 2 from meningitis. There were 4 deaths from heart disease and 2 from apoplexy. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 21, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 8. Four inquests were held. The deaths in all these cases were attributed to accidental suffocation in bed. Under the Public Health Act certificates have been received for 16 cases of scarlet fever, 3 of diphtheria, 9 of erysipelas, 2 of membranous croup, and 1 of typhoid fever, making a total of 31. The increased mortality is due to the late prevalence of cold and damp weather and fogs. February 6th, 1893. During the three weeks that ended on the 28th day of January, 209 births and 133 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 42.6, and an annual rate of mortality of 27.1 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 26.0. The number of deaths from the chief diseases of the zymotic class was 7, viz.: from measles 1, scarlet fever 1, diphtheria 4, and diarrhoea 1. Diseases of the respiratory system caused 46 deaths, of which 25 were attributed to bronchitis, 20 to pneumonia, and 1 to asthma. From diseases of the tubercular order there were 12 deaths, viz.: 9 from phthisis and 3 from meningitis. The other causes of death include 6 from old age, 6 from cancer, and 2 from influenza and bronchitis. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 27, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 43. Fifteen inquests were held. Three deaths were due to violence and 12 to natural causes. The latter included 2 deaths from fatty degeneration of the heart consequent upon chronic alcoholic excess. Four deaths were uncertified. The notifications of infectious diseases received from January 14th to February 4th numbered 51, there being of scarlet fever 22 cases, small-pox 2, diphtheria 9, erysipelas 11, enteric fever 3, and membranous croup 4. xlviii BER 16 The cases of small-pox occurred in one family. The first case was a labourer who had been travelling about the country and had been away from home for nine weeks. He came home on January 19th, and was then suffering from the disease. February 20th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 11th day of February, 142 births and 51 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 43.5, and an annual rate of mortality of 15.6 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 19.7. The deaths from diseases of the zymotic class were 4 from diphtheria and 2 from diarrhoea. From diseases of the respiratory system there were 19 deaths, of which 11 were referred to bronchitis, 5 to pneumonia, and 3 to croup. Two deaths were attributed to meningitis, 4 to cancer, 3 to old age, and 2 to influenza associated with other diseases. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 13, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 15. Nine inquests were held. Three deaths were due to violent causes, including one of suicide. Two deaths were consequent on chronic alcoholic excess. The notified cases of infectious disease were of smallpox 3, scarlet fever 12, diphtheria 2, erysipelas 5, and membranous croup 2. The cases of small-pox were all members of one family. They were removed to the hospital. March 6th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 25th day of February, 130 births and 50 deaths were registered in the xlix parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 39.9 and an annual rate of mortality of 15.3 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 19.4. The deaths from diseases of the zymotic class were 3 from scarlet fever and 1 from diphtheria. Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 22 deaths, including 10 from bronchitis, and 10 from pneumonia. From diseases of the tubercular order there were 6 deaths and from old age 2. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 12, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 10. Seven inquests were held. Six of the deaths were from natural causes and one from suicide by hanging. Twenty cases of infectious diseases were reported, viz. : scarlet fever 13, diphtheria 2, small-pox 1, erysipelas 3, and typhoid 1. The case of small-pox was observed at the Relieving Office. The man had come from Southwark Chambers, Tooley Street. To-day I have visited three cases of smallpox in Princes Road. Two of these are children who have not been vaccinated. The father of these children is in the employment of the Vestry. He should be excused from his work for a fortnight. I have recommended the removal of the infected persons and the re-vaccination of all the other inmates of the house. The room is in a dirty condition. March 20th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 11th day of March 125 births and 52 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 37.4, and an annual rate of mortality of 15.9 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 19.9. 1 The deaths from the chief zymotic diseases were from measles, scarlet fever, enteric fever, and diarrhoea, each one. From diseases of the respiratory organs there were 18 deaths, of which 7 were from bronchitis and 9 from pneumonia. Diseases of the tubercular order caused 9 deaths, including 5 from phthisis. One death was recorded from influenza and bronchitis. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 19, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 12. The notification of cases of infectious diseases numbered 32. There were for scarlet fever 16, small-pox 5, diphtheria 5, erysipelas 4, puerperal fever 1, and membranous croup 1. The Thames at Hampton was, in the early part of last month, in very bad condition, both chemically and bacterially. Contrasted with the raw river water the supply of the Southwark Company showed an improvement of 28 per cent, chemically and 97 per cent, bacterially. The total solid matter was 23½ grains per gallon. The water was efficiently filtered before delivery. I have inspected Ship and Mermaid Court, Camperdown, part of Snowsfields, Garden Row, Kirby Street, Ferguson's Rents, Webb's Court and Suffolk Place. Half of the houses are empty and in a ruinous condition. The rest of the houses are generally old, rotten, and worn out; many of them are small and badly constructed ; some of the rooms are very low pitched and inadequately lighted and ventilated. Too many houses are crowded on a limited area. I am of opinion that the sanitary defects in this area cannot be effectually remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the re-arrangement and re-construction of the streets and houses within this area, and I have therefore prepared an official representation respecting the same to be dealt with by the London County Council under the provisions of Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes' Act, 1890. li An official representation under the Artizans' Dwellings. Act was made to the Metropolitan Board of Works by my predecessor, Dr. Parker, on the 29th of October, 1875, [i.e., 17 years ago], respecting this area. The Sanitary Officer of the Vestry has been dealing with this property, under the Sanitary Acts, ever since. The result has been that half the houses are unoccupied, and the owners of some of the other houses refuse to carry out the works ordered by the Vestry. April 10th, 1893. During the three weeks that ended on the Ist day of April 195 births and 85 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 39.7, and an annual rate of mortality of 17.3 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 20.2 The chief diseases of the zymotic class caused 8 deaths, viz.: measles 2, diphtheria 3, and diarrhoea 3. From diseases of the respiratory organs there were 29 deaths, of which 18 were referred to bronchitis and 11 topneumonia. Diseases of the tubercular order caused 9 deaths, including 5 from phthisis. There were 4 deaths from heart disease, 2 from cancer and 2 from old age. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 35, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 21. Six inquests were held. Four infants died from accidental suffocation in bed. The notifications of infectious diseases from March 18th to April 7th were 35 in number, viz.: scarlet fever 18, diphtheria 3, erysipelas 9, small-pox 1, enteric fever 1, and membranous croup 3. lii I have inspected the sanitary accommodation provided for the use of the men employed in the Locomotive Department of the South Eastern Railway Company at Bricklayers' Arms Station, and find that it is insufficient and unsuitable, and a nuisance dangerous to health. The new shed is an open cesspool with a low wall in front to serve the purpose of seats. There is no water supply, and no provision of dry earth or other deodorant. Further eastward on the north side of the factory is an open trough about 20 feet in length with a low wall in front, but no other seat. At the bottsm of this pit a small stream of water trickles from one end to the other, but there is no sufficient means for properly flushing the trench. In a line with this structure is a similar one about 9 or 10 feet in length, to which the same description applies. The sheds are covered by a roof but are open in front. Notice should be served on the Company to abolish the cesspool, and provide suitable water-closet accommodation with means of flushing. May Ist, 1893. During the three weeks that ended on the 22nd day of April 171 births and 78 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 34.9 and an annual rate of mortality of 15.9 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 20.6. The only deaths recorded from zymotic diseases were 2 from diphtheria and 2 from influenza. Diseases of the respiratory system caused 18 deaths, including 6 from bronchitis and 9 from pneumonia. From diseases of the tubercular order there were 11 deaths, 7 of which were referred to phthisis. The other causes of death included 7 from heart disease, 3 from old age, 2 from cancer, and 2 from diabetes. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 20, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 14. liii Five inquests were held. Four deaths were attributed to violent causes. One was a case of poisoning by eating mussels. The water supplied by the Southwark Company was efficiently filtered. The notifications of infectious diseases between 10th and 28th April numbered 37. They were for small-pox 9, scarlet fever 16, erysipelas 4, diphtheria 5, enteric fever 2, and puerperal fever 1. May 15th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 6th day of May, 140 births and 58 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 42 - 9, and an annual rate of mortality of 15.9 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 19.0 The deaths from diseases of the zymotic class were 2 from measles, 1 from whooping cough, and 1 from diarrhoea. Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 17 deaths, of which 10 were referred to pneumonia and 5 to bronchitis. From diseases of the tubercular order there were 10 deaths, from old age 4, and from heart disease 3.

The notifications of cases of infectious disease from April 29th to May 12th were 37, viz.: of small-pox 8, scarlet fever 19, erysipelas 3, diphtheria 6, and typhus fever 1. The number of deaths from small-pox in London during the last two weeks were 6 and 11, and the number of cases of this disease in the hospitals were 474 and 531. The disease is widely distributed, but appears to be of a less severely fatal character than in previous epidemics. liv June 5th, 1893. During the three weeks that ended on the 27th day of May 191 births and 76 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 39., and an annual rate of mortality of 16.5 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 17.8. The chief diseases of the zymotic class caused 9 deaths, viz.: diphtheria 5, whooping cough 1, typhus (so called) 1, and diarrhoea 2.

A case which was reported as diphtheria on June 1st was admitted into Guy's Hospital as suffering from bronchitis and pneumonia, and has not been further notified as a case of infectious disease. June 19th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 10th day of June, 125 births and 60 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 38.3, and an annual rate of mortality of 18.4 per thousand of the estimated population.

Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 10 deaths, including 5 from bronchitis and 4 from pneumonia. From diseases of the tubercular order there were 10 deaths, of which 6 were referred to phthisis. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 19, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 6. Five inquests were held. All the deaths were attributed to natural causes. Two deaths of children were uncertified. The notifications of infectious diseases received from June 3rd to 16th were 58, including scarlet fever 30 (one duplicate), erysipelas 7 (one duplicate), diphtheria 10, small-pox 5, membranous croup 2, enteric or typhoid fever 4. The water supplied during the last month by the Southwark Company was of good chemical quality. The deaths from small-pox in London which had been 16 and 9 in the preceding two weeks further fell last week to 7, corresponding with the corrected average. The number of cases of this disease under treatment in the hospitals was 495, against 566 in the previous week. The deaths from scarlet fever were 24, being 6 above the average. The hospitals contained 2,649 cases of scarlet fever, against 2,345, 2,493 and 2,582 at the end of the preceding three weeks.

On Wednesday last I attended the Conference of Representatives from Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis at the Court House, St. Marylebone. The representatives of twenty-three Sanitary Authorities were present. A resolution was adopted to " appoint a Deputation to wait upon the Local Government Board for the purpose of urging them to facilitate the acquisition of sites by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or the provision of suitable buildings." July 17 th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 8th day of July 102 births and 50 deaths were registered in the parish.

From diseases of the respiratory organs there were 25 deaths, including 13 from bronchitis and 9 from pneumonia. To diseases of the tubercular order 32 deaths were referred, of which 21 were due to phthisis. The other causes of death included 10 from heart disease; 8 from brain diseases, 6 from old age, 5 from cancer, and 5 from child-birth. lix The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 72, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 28. Fifteen inquests were held. Five deaths were due to violence, including 1 case of suicide.

They were of scarlet fever 89, small-pox 3, erysipelas 25, diphtheria 24, membranous croup 2, enteric fever 5, typhoid 2, puerperal fever 1, continued fever 1. A letter on the notification of infectious diseases has been received from the Vestry of Rotherhithe, which I have the pleasure of submitting. I have visited the premises of the London and South Eastern Railway Company, and of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company, where stable manure is received for the purpose of being sent into the country. I did not find any more commodious and open space on either station than the one in use. I was informed by the officials that offensive materials are not received, that fish refuse is not taken except during the winter months, that stable manure, peat manure and rag refuse are received between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5.30 p.m., and that everything of the nature of manure which has been brought to the station in the intervals of those hours is invariably removed during the following night. I saw several trucks which were loaded with fresh stable dung, one truck with old and rotten stable manure, one with spent hops, and one with a mixture of stable dung and lime grounds. There was practically no nuisance which I could certify, under the circumstances, as being injurious to health. If due care be taken by the foreman in charge of the trucks in observing the regulations, and in loading the trucks at the lx greatest possible distance from any house, school, or public road, I do not think that any nuisance is likely to arise requiring the action of the Vestry under the Public Health Act. October 2nd, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 23rd day of September 128 births and 45 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 39.2, and an annual rate of mortality of 13.8 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 18.2. Diseases of the zymotic class caused 8 deaths, viz.: measles 2, scarlet fever 1, diphtheria 1, whooping cough 2, and diarrhæa 2. From diseases of the respiratory organs there were 11 deaths, from tubercular diseases 7, and from old age 3. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 16, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 7. One inquest was held. The death was attributed to an accidental fall. Four deaths were uncertified. The number of notifications of cases of infectious disease received from the 18th to 29th September was 48, viz.: of scarlet fever 27, diphtheria 11, erysipelas 8, typhoid fever 1, and membranous croup 1. The Metropolitan Asylum and London Fever Hospitals contained 2,848 scarlet fever patients at the end of the week (September 23rd), against 2,889 on the previous Saturday. The figures for the hospitals represent patients certified on admission to be suffering from scarlet fever, diphtheria, or enteric fever respectively, but in a considerable proportion of cases the diagnosis is found, after sojourn in the hospital, to have been erroneous. The London County Council deeming it important that every facility should be given at the present time for determining the precise nature of the illness of persons lxi suspected to be suffering from Asiatic Cholera in London, have authorised their Medical Officer to send to Dr. Klein, for the purpose of bacteriological examination, materials from cases which it is desirable should be thus investigated. The Metropolitan Asylums Board think that the attention of all medical practitioners should be called to the matter of the notification of cases of cholera, and will be glad to hear what action the Vestry propose to take with that object. The Local Government Board request that the Sanitary Authority would take into early consideration the question of their readiness to meet any emergency that might arise in the event of the introduction of cholera into London. The Board request the Sanitary Authority to revise the arrangements which were contemplated last year with a view to those arrangements being promptly brought into operation if the necessity should arise. October 16th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 7th day of October, 113 births and 50 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 34.6, and an annual rate of mortality of 15.3 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 19.0. Zymotic diseases caused 9 deaths, viz.: measles 1, diphtheria 2, whooping cough 3, and diarrhœa 3. From diseases of the respiratory system there were 9 deaths, and those of the tubercular order 12. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 19, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 2. Five inquests were held. One death was referred to accidental suffocation in bed. Two deaths were uncertified. The certificates of infectious diseases received from September 30th to October 14th, numbered 57. They were of cases of scarlet fever 36, diphtheria 8, erysipelas 11, and enteric fever 2. lxii The number of cases of small-pox under treatment on Saturday, October 7th, in the hospitals was 79, against 112, 91, and 77 on the preceding three Saturdays. The Metropolitan Asylum and London Fever Hospitals contained 2,801 scarlet fever patients against 2,889, 2,849 and 2,815 on the preceding three Saturdays. The deaths from diphtheria which had been 65, 88, and 96 in the preceding three weeks fell again last week to 74, but exceeded the corrected average by 43. The deaths from diarrhœa, which had been 118, 95, and 87 in the preceding three weeks, further fell last week to 52, being 9 below the corrected average. One death in each of the last two weeks was referred to cholera or choleraic diarrhœa. I am informed that an inmate of Greenwich Workhouse visited a house in Princes Road on October 10th. On enquiry at the house I found that no inmate of the house has since suffered from diarrhœal disease. In order to meet the requirements of the Local Government Board I have divided the map of the parish into twenty sections, and have advised the Sanitary Inspector to institute a house to house visitation throughout those parts of the parish where cholera was most prevalent on former visitations of that disease. I have every reason to believe that the parish is in a very good sanitary condition, but it is well known that defects in the drainage and water supply apparatus are continually occurring, and that these defects are not complained of by the tenants, but have to be discovered by the sanitary officers. It is therefore desirable that a prompt and rapid inspection should be made to discover any weak points which may exist, The ward in Botherhithe Infirmary which, last year, was set apart for cholera cases in now full of ordinary patients, and consequently no special provision against cholera in this district is, at the present moment, in existence. lxiii November 6th, 1893. During the three weeks that ended on the 28th day of October, 203 births and 89 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 41.5, and an annual rate of mortality of 18.2 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 18.2. From diseases of the zymotic class there were 10 deaths, viz.: from diphtheria 4, whooping cough 3, and diarrhœa 3. Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 28 deaths, of which 10 were from bronchitis and 18 from pneumonia. To diseases of the tubercular order 13 deaths were referred, including 9 from phthisis. There were 5 deaths from diseases of the brain, 4 from cancer, 2 from age, and 2 from puerperal fever. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 22, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 17. Four deaths were uncertified. Three inquests were held. Two children died from accidental suffocation in bed. The number of certificates of cases of infectious diseases received between October 14th and November 4th was 89, viz.: of scarlet fever 41, diphtheria 25, erysipelas 17, enteric or typhoid fever 4, and puerperal fever 2. The water supplied by the Southwark Company was efficiently filtered and of good quality. The number of cases of diphtheria under treatment in the hospitals on October 28th, was 306, and of scarlet fever 2778. Complaint has been made by the neighbours of a nuisance arising from the smoke-curing of fish at 160, Grange Road. The situation is not a suitable one for a business of this kind, and sufficient care is not taken by the occupier to prevent the process from being a nuisance to the inhabitants of adjoining houses. BER 16 The teachers of Galley Wall Road Board School have complained of a nuisance from the size factory at the back of the school. I have visited the premises in question, but did not find anything upon which I could recommend legal proceedings to be taken. Some cases of sore throat have occurred at the school which have been supposed to have been caused by the stench from the factory, but as a matter of fact, the drains at the school were in a very defective state, and their condition was a more probable cause of sore throat. November 20th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 11th day of November, 151 births and 89 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 46.3, and an annual rate of mortality of 25.1 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 21.0. The chief diseases of the zymotic class caused 12 deaths, viz.: diphtheria 7, whooping cough 3, and diarrhœa 2. Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 40 deaths, viz.: bronchitis 18, pneumonia 18, laryngitis 2, and pulmonary congestion 2. Two deaths were referred to influenza. From diseases of the tubercular order there were 9 deaths, including 5 from phthisis. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 24, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 9. Five inquests were held. Two deaths were due to violence. The number of certificates of cases of infectious disease received from November 4th to November 17th, was 58. They were of scarlet fever 28, diphtheria 12, erysipelas 11, typhoid fever 2, membranous croup 2, and enteric fever, 2. lxv The increase in the general mortality is due to the greater fatality of diseases of the respiratory system. Diphtheria is prevalent throughout London. The number of cases of scarlet fever in the hospitals on November 11th was 3,071, and on November 4th, 2,906. December 4th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 23rd day of November, 107 births and 76 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 32.8, and an annual rate of mortality of 23.3 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 25.4. Six deaths were recorded from zymotic diseases, viz.: 5 from diphtheria and 1 from whooping cough. Diseases of the respiratory system caused the large number of 36 deaths, viz. : 18 from bronchitis, and 18 from pneumonia. One death was attributed to influenza and bronchitis. From diseases of the tubercular order there were 5 deaths, from heart disease 4, and from old age 2. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 27, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 14. Five inquests were held. Two deaths were due to accidental suffocation in bed.

The number of cases of scarlet fever in the hospitals on November 25th was 3,140, and of diphtheria 311. I have inspected the works in progress for the construction of a new sewer in Fendall Street, and report that there is nothing therein detrimental to public health. December 18th, 1893. During the fortnight that ended on the 9th day of December, 106 births and 85 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 32.5, and an annual rate of mortality of 26.0 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 29.0. There were only 6 deaths from the chief zymotic diseases, viz.: 1 from diphtheria, 4 from whooping cough, and 1 from diarrhœa. Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 44 deaths, viz.: bronchitis 24, pneumonia 19, and laryngitis 1. There were 2 deaths from influenza associated with bronchitis. From tubercular diseases there were 6 deaths, from cancer 3, and from heart disease 3. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 27, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 15. Two inquests were held, and 5 deaths were uncertified. All the latter were deaths of infants. The notices of infectious diseases from December 3rd to 15th numbered 26, viz.: of cases of scarlet fever 11, diphtheria 7, and erysipelas 26. The number of cases of scarlet fever in the hospitals on December 9th was 3129, and of diphtheria 308. The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs in London during the last four weeks rose from 615 to 841, and those primarily attributed to influenza rose from 22 to 127. I have inspected the railway arches crossing the streets in the parish. The walls of the arches under the South Eastern Railway appear to have been whitewashed at no very distant date. The portions beneath the London and Brighton Railway are dirty and need whitewashing. The walls of several arches are damp in various places from percolation of water. That over White's Grounds is the Ixvii worst in this respect. The arch in Abbey Street is very leaky, especially at the junction of the two lines of railway. The pathway under this arch is frequently in a very filthy state on Sunday mornings. The arches generally are not in a proper sanitary condition. Januarg 1st, 1894. During the fortnight that ended on the 23rd day of December 106 births and 96 deaths were registered in the parish. These numbers indicate an annual birth-rate of 32.5, and an annual rate of mortality of 29.4 per thousand of the estimated population. The corresponding death-rate in London was 27.7. The chief diseases of the zymotic class caused 11 deaths, viz.: diphtheria 3, and whooping cough 8. One death was referred to influenza. From diseases of the respiratory organs there were 34 deaths, of which 17 were from bronchitis and 14 from pneumonia. Tubercular diseases caused 13 deaths, including 8 from phthisis and 4 from meningitis. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 36, and of persons aged 60 years and upwards 19. Six inquests were held. All the deaths were attributed to natural causes. Four deaths were uncertified. The notifications of cases of infectious diseases from December 15th to 29th numbered 40; there being of scarlet fever 18, diphtheria 9, erysipelas 7, typhoid or enteric fever 5, and membranous croup 1. In conjunction with the Sanitary Inspector I have visited the houses 21, 22 and 23, Long Walk, and am of opinion that they are worn out and decayed and unfit for human habitation. Ixviii
