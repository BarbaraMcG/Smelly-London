The Board submit with this, their Report for the year 1883-84:— A Statement of their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1884, and of their Assets and Liabilities on that day, with detailed particulars and summary statements of the same. A statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1881-82, 1882-83, and 1883-4. A Table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1884. A Statement of the Contracts entered into by the Board during the year ended 25th March, 1884. The Board also submit the Report of their Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended 31st December, 1883, containing particulars of the population, rate of mortality, and other statistics relating to the general health of the District; and the Report of the Board's Surveyor for the year ended Lady-day, 1884, in which will be found the particulars of the works carried out under his supervision. During the Financial year, i.e., from 25th March, 1883, to 25th March, 1884, the Board have paid the sum of £5,906 18s. 3d. in reduction of the mortgages owing by them. They have also raised during the same period the sum of £2,800 for new permanent works and improvements in the District. The Board are glad to report that the Loans which in past years were raised at 5 per cent. interest have now all been paid off, with the exception of one, which had only four months to run and has since been paid off, and two which have but three more years to run. 2 The new Loans, owing to the hotter financial arrangements now in vogue, having been obtained at the rate of 3½ per cent. IMPROVEMENTS. The Surveyor in his Report has given the usual particulars of the various Improvements effected during the year. As stated in the Board's last Report, the Bridge north of Forest Hill Railway Station, with the widened road thereunder, had been finally completed, and it was hoped the other improvements in connection with the Forest Hill Railway Station would have been finished. The proceedings then referred to as pending with regard to the steps placed in the subway without the consent of the Board were still continuing at Lady day, 1884; but negotiations have subsequently been opened by the Company for the amicable and advantageous settlement of the disputed questions. The only Improvement of importance effected during the year has been the opening up of the road between Thurston Road and Deptford, which will be of considerable public advantage. During the past year the Board have, in pursuance of their resolution, planted a number of young trees on the public roads in the place of the old trees which, it had been necessary to remove. THE BOARD'S HOSPITAL. This Establishment—for the isolation of infectious diseases—has been maintained throughout the year in a thorough state of efficiency, although, again owing to the healthy state of the district, but few cases have occurred needing isolation. No deaths have taken place in the Hospital during the year. NEW STREETS AND SEWERS. The various works projected and carried out by the Board under this head will, as in previous years, be found specified in the Surveyor's Report (p. 9). FIRE PLUG INDICATORS. As stated in previous Reports these indicators are marked upon the gas lamps to indicate the position of the various 3 fire-plugs in the district. The Board again refer to them in this year's Report, feeling assured that this information cannot be too frequently brought before the public. STREET NAMING, &c. During the year the following Orders have been made by the Metropolitan Board, altering Street names and numbers, and have been duly carried out by this Board:— An Order for re-numbering the houses in the part of Church Road, Upper Norwood, in this District. „ for re-numbering the houses in Devonshire Road, Forest Hill. „ re-naming Forbes Road, Penge, "Mosslea Road, S.E." „ directing that the part of Longton Grove, from Taylor's Lane to Wells Road, should be re-named "Longton Avenue, S.E." „ re-naming Mary Ann Place, Perry Hill, as " Creeland Grove, S.E ," and for re-numbering the houses there. SANITARY. The Sanitary condition of the district continues highly satisfactory. The Board append the Report of the Medical Officer for the year ended 31st December last, from which it will be seen that the annual rate of mortality in the District was 13.56 per 1000, whilst the annual rate of the whole of London for the like period amounted to 20.4 per 1000, and of Districts outside London 16.7. The number of inhabited houses and the population of the district also continue to increase, as shewn by the Table in the Medical Officer's Report annexed (page 8). The number in each case, at Midsummer, 1883, being— Inhabited houses 12,361 Estimated population 77,572 The Return (Table VI.), shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Committees, and 4 the proceedings taken thereon. The Slaughter-houses, Cowhouses, and Fishmongers' premises, have been periodically inspected by the Board's Sanitary Officers. Under this head the Board wish again to mention a sanitary matter to which considerable time and attention is devoted by the Board's Committees and their Officers, and which is of great importance to the health of a growing community, viz., the collection and removal of Dust, &c. The cost of this work still exceeds £2,000 per annum, and every effort is made, without increasing that expenditure, to keep the district as clear from dust as possible. The Board again urgently request all householders to see that the men are not refused the dust on calling, and that any vegetable, animal, or other matter, which may be burnt or otherwise destroyed, be not placed in the ashpits. Any complaints of the non-clearance of ashpits may be made by letter to the Board, at their Offices, when attention will be given to the same ; but it is apparent that the Board cannot collect the dust more frequently than at present without incurring a much heavier outlay. BAKEHOUSES. The inspection and control of Bakehouses has again been placed in the hands of the Local Authorities. The Board feeling the necessity for such inspection and control, pressed upon the higher authorities the importance of allowing it to revert to the Local Governing Bodies, and this result the Board are glad to say, has been attained. By the 17th sec of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, it is provided that— "As rcspects every retail bakehouse, the provisions of the Act, and of sects. 3, 33, 34, and 35 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, which relate to cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and other sanitary conditions, should be enforced by the local authority of the district in which the bakehouse is situate, and not by an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878 and that for the purpose of such section it was enacted that the Medical Officer of Health should have and 5 exercise all such powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings and otherwise, as an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878." RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable Value of the District at the end of the year 1883, was— Lewisham £402,879 Penge 161,560 Total £564,439 Showing an increase on the amounts mentioned in the last report of— Lewisham £16,764 Penge 6,972 Total increase £23,736 EXPENDITURE. Inasmuch as this Board has to collect and pay over to the different Metropolitan Boards very considerable sums in the course of the year, it may be well to note that the actual amount required by this Board during the year under review for its own purposes, from the Guardians of the Poor of Lewisham, was only the sum of £33,599, being equivalent to a rate, on the Rateable Value in force at the commencement of the year, of a fraction over 1s. 8d. in the pound. The amount so required from the Overseers of the Hamlet of Penge was £9,175, being equivalent to a rate of a fraction over 1s. 2d. in the pound. The amounts which the Board raised for Metropolitan Bodies, and paid over to them, were: —For the Metropolitan Board, £14,263 12s. 2d.; for the School Board, £15,702 17s. 2d. The Metropolitan Board's Precept for the year ending 31st December, 1884, and embracing a portion of the year now under review, is £1,199 in excess of the sum thus required; and that of the London School Board for the same period is £3,369 in excess of the amount raised for their purposes in the past year. 6 RATES AND LOANS. As stated in the first paragraph of this Report the Board submit particulars of the Loans at Lady-day, 1884; but a special Return having been made during the year, for the information of the Secretary of State, the Board deem it advisable to append a copy of the same to this Report for general information (see page 11). SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. Notwithstanding the facilities offered, enabling the ratepayers to avail themselves of these Acts for the detection of adulteration of food, milk, &c., very few have taken advantage thereof. Full particulars of these facilities, as given in a public notice issued by the Board, are set out in previous Reports; and for convenience the Board again repeat the same:— The Notice referred to. "The attention of the Board having been called to the desirability of giving greater facilities than at present exist to the general public in aid of the working of 'The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts', they have now made arrangements with the Public Analyst of the District, Mr. C. Heisch, of 79, Mark Lane, E.C., whereby samples and articles desired by any resident in the District to be analysed may be left with the Secretary of the Board during office hours, at their Offices, and no further trouble in the matter need then fall on such resident, as, in the event of such sample proving upon analysis to be adulterated, the resident is not compelled to prosecute the seller. A fee of 2s. 6d., which must be paid at once, will be charged for each sample brought by a resident for analysis, the balance of the Analyst's fee of 10s. 6d. will be paid by the Board. "Care should be taken that the samples brought for analysis are in the same condition as when bought. The name and address of the seller must be supplied, and the buyer must sign the proper form, which will be prepared at the Board's Offices. All samples received for analysis are accepted in strict confidence, and the result will be communicated to the buyer direct by post. "The only expense to the buyer is the payment of the beforementioned fee of 2s. 6d. "If residents within the District have reasonable grounds for suspecting any seller of adulterating, they may write to the Board, giving the name and address of the seller and the article suspected 7 and enclosing a double fee of 5s., when the Board will direct their Inspectors of Nuisances to take the necessary steps for obtaining an analysis without further reference or expense to the resident; and if the article is found to be adulterated further steps will be taken by the Board. Such communications will also be received in strict confidence. No notice can be taken of anonymous communications, although the fee may be enclosed." PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. In November the Board received notice of the following Schemes proposed to be introduced into Parliament, viz.:— The Peckham and East Dulwich Tramways. The South-Eastern Metropolitan (Lewisham, Greenwich, and District) Tramways. The South-Eastern Metropolitan Tramways. The East of London, Crystal Palace, and South-Eastern Junction Railway. The London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—Shortlands and Nunhead. Of these Schemes one only, viz., the South-Eastern Metropolitan (Lewisham, Greenwich, and District) Tramways passed the Committee of the House of Commons and received the Royal Assent. The Board again, after very long and mature consideration, came to the conclusion that, provided the ratepayers were protected from any increased expense and the promoters were willing to keep the roads, over which their lines were laid, in repair, there was no necessity to oppose the Bill. Accordingly after the Promoters had agreed to the Board's terms, the Board assisted the Bill in passing. MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT. There was considerable discussion throughout the year as to the projected Scheme for the Reform of the Municipal Government of London, but to the date of this Report, 25th March, the Government Bill had not been introduced into Parliament. REPRESENTATION AT METROPOLITAN BOARD. On the 26th September, 1883, the Board requested the Works and General Purposes Committee to prepare a Memorial to be laid before the Metropolitan Board of Works, setting 8 forth the urgent reasons that existed in favour of this Board having a separate representative at the Metropolitan Board, and requesting that Board to adopt the necessary measures to carry out this Board's wish into effect. At the present time this Board is joined with the Plumstead Board of Works in electing a joint Member to the Metropolitan Board, and for the past fourteen years a Member of the Plumstead Board of Works has been elected to fill this office, and inasmuch as the Members of the Plumstead Board number 37, and the Members of this Board only 27, it is apparent that it is always in the power of the Plumstead Board to elect their own Representative, and that, therefore, for all practical purposes, the Lewisham Board is unrepresented at the Metropolitan Board. This state of affairs has long been considered by this Board as unsatisfactory and unjust, as the interests of the Lewisham Board are larger than those of the Plumstead Board, the population of the Lewisham District, according to the Census of 1881, amounting to about 72,000, or 8,000 in excess of the Plumstead District, the rateable value of the District at 1884 being £564,439, or £238,867 in excess of the Plumstead District. A Memorial, of which a copy is appended, was duly prepared, approved, and sealed by the Board, and the appointment having been made, a Deputation, consisting of all the Members of the Board, attended the Metropolitan Board on the 9th November. 1883, and presented the same. Mr. Theo. W. Williams, the Chairman, addressed the Metropolitan Board of Works in support of the Memorial, and the same was referred, together with a similar Memorial presented by the Plumstead District Board of Works, to the Works and General Purposes Committee of the Board, but no further information had been given this Board on the subject at the date of this Report, June, 1884. DEATH OF MR. LLOYD. The Board were informed on the 12th March of the death of Mr. James R. Lloyd, the Representative of the joint 9 Districts of Lewisham and Plumstead at the Metropolitan Board of Works, and at their Meeting on that day the following resolutions were unanimously passed:— "That the Board has heard with deep regret of the death of Mr. James Richard Lloyd, who for upwards of 14 years last past has represented this Board, jointly with the Plumstead Board, at the Metropolitan Board of Works, during which period he has expended a large amount of time, energy, and ability in forwarding the interests of the united Districts, and that this Board desire to place upon record their high appreciation of his services, and to tender to Mrs. Lloyd and her family their deep sympathy and condolence with them in their sad bereavement." "That a letter be written to the Plumstead Board, expressing the sympathy of this Board with them in the loss they have sustained in the death of Mr. Lloyd." DEPUTATIONS. During the year the Board have appointed Members to attend several deputations and confcrcnces called for the discussion of different questions affecting the general wellbeing of the Metropolis, and mention may be made of the following among others— The proposed amalgamation of the Gas Light and Coke Co. with the South Metropolitan Gas Company. Conference of South London Vestries and District Boards. The Metropolitan Cab Radius. The Metropolitan Water Company's Charges and Metropolitan Water Supply. Telephone and Telegraph—overhead—Wires. The Expenditure of the School Board for London. Itinerant Showmen. AUDIENCES OF BOARD. The following amended Bye-laws were made and confirmed by the Board on the 13th February, 1884:— "Interviews. "I. A personal interview shall not be granted by the Board to any person or number of persons at any Meeting of the Board unless a written application be made at least 48 hours before the time of Meeting, stating the object of the interview; and the 10 same, if granted, shall take place at a quarter after Five o'clock in the afternoon, or at such other time as the Board may from time to time appoint. "II. That upon any such interview being so granted to any person or number of persons, or to a deputation, such person or persons, or deputation, shall be required to be introduced by a Member of the Board, and one person only of any such number of persons or deputation attending shall be allowed to address the Board upon the subject of the interview, and thereupon the same shall be referred to a Committee, or be otherwise dealt with as may be deemed expedient." THE ANNUAL INSPECTION. It has been the custom of the Board for many years to make an Annual Inspection of the District. As will be remembered the District consists of the Parish of Lewisham, divided into three Wards, returning in all 21 Members, and of the Hamlet of Penge returning 6 Members; and it may be imagined that the Members thus returned in many instances are not well acquainted with the other parts of the District, therefore it has been found of the utmost use that each Member should, at least once a year, visit the different parts of this widely-extended District, and be able to inspect the various works in progress or in contemplation; they are then in a position to bring personal knowledge to aid them in the discussion of the necessity or otherwise of the proposed Works.

WINNETT, Secretary to the Board. Clerk to the Board. 13 The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. To the Metropolitan Board of "Works. The Memorial of the Board of Works for the Lewisliam District, under their Common Seal, Sheweth— 1. That in the year 1855 an Act of Parliament was passed entituled "An Act for the Better Local Management of the Metropolis." That your Memorialists form one of the District Boards constituted by such Act, and are set forth in the second part of Schedule B of such Act as returning one Member to the Metropolitan Board of Works, in conjunction with the Board of Works for the Plumstead District. 2. That your Memorialists, the Board of Works for the Lewisham District, consists, according to such Act, of 27 Members, and that of the Plumstead Board of 37 Members; and it follows that, in electing a Representative to your Honourable Board, the Plumstead Board has 37 votes against the 27 votes of the Lewisham Board, consequently, although nominally the Lewisham Board join in electing a Representative to your Honourable Board, as a matter of fact and practice, they can have no material voice, under ordinary circumstances, in the election. 3. That since the constitution of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards in 1856, vast changes have taken place in the position of such Vestries and District Boards with regard to the relative importance owing to the varying rates of increase both in population and rateable value that have occurred in their respective districts. Your Memorialists submit, as a not unreasonable request, that after a lapse of 27 years some alteration or increase in the representation to your Honourable Board should be made, in order to redress the anomalies that such changes have necessarily caused. 4. At the formation of the District your Memorialists had only a population, according to the census of 1851, of 16,233, being the smallest of any of the Districts contained in Schedule B, and being also a smaller population than any of the Parishes contained in Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule A, with the exception of the Parish of St. John, Hampstead. But according to the last ccnsus (1881) the population of your Memorialists' District had increased to 14 72,000, which population has still further increased according to the present estimates to 74,901; which places this District, with regard to population, 14th in the list of all the Parishes and Districts in the Metropolis (excluding from consideration the six great Parishes returning more than one Member to your Honourable Board), and leaves 19 Parishes and Districts with a less population than your Memorialists, all of whom, with the exception of the Plumstead Board, the St. Olave's District Board, and Rotherhithe, return each a Member to your Honourable Board. 5. Your Honourable Board will perhaps consider it of more importance to ascertain the amount of rateable value which is taxed by your Honourable Board, but which your Memorialists submit, under the circumstances already stated, is at present unrepresented at your Board. The rateable value of this District at its formation in 1850 amounted to £138,100, being the 3rd lowest in amount of all the Districts contained in Schedule B, excepting Plumstead, with which it was joined ; whereas, from the statement of Rateable Values contained in the Apportionment of your Honourable Board of the sums required to be raised by your Honourable Board for the present year, 1883, it will be seen that the rateable value of your Memorialists' District now amounts to £540,703, and that in respect thereof they now stand the 11th on the list of Parishes and District Boards sending one Member to your Honourable Board; and that there are no less than 19 other Parishes and District Boards, returning one Member each, who have a less rateable value than your Memorialists, counting the District of St. Olave's and the Parish of Rotherhithe for the purpose as one Board; and that the rateable value of the District of your Memorialists is double the rateable value of three of the District Boards sending a representative to your Honourable Board. 6. That the number of inhabited houses in your Memorialists' District, according to the census of 1851, only amounted to 2,770, whereas the inhabited houses therein in the year 1882 are estimated to have increased to 11,941, and were, according to the census taken in 1881, 11,543. 7. Your Memorialis beg to call your attention to the fact that lor the present year, 1883, your Honourable Board requires the payment of the sum of £14,261 10s. as the apportioned amount due from the Lewisham District; and your Memorialists feel that they are justified, and indeed bound, in the interests of the 15 payers of their District, to use their utmost endeavours to obtain a representation on a Board to whom so much of their money is entrusted, and to ask your Honourable Board to take such steps as may be necessary for enabling your Memorialists to return a separate Member to your Honourable Board. 8. Your Memorialists would also state that whilst their District has been thus increasing in population and rateable value, the District of the Plumstead Board has also been very largely increasing, although not quite in the same proportion, the figures in respect of their District being as follows:—Population in 1851, 19,771; according to the last census, 63,663. Rateable value in 1856, £104,930; in 1883, £317,465. Inhabited houses in 1851, 3,310 ; according to the last census, 9,989. It will thus be seen that the Plumstead Board ranks the 23rd in the list of Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards sending one representative to your Honourable Board, and that there are six Boards with less rateable value sending one Member to your Honourable Board, not counting the combined District of St. Olave and the Parish of Rotherhithe. 9. The District of your Memorialists is 6,544 statute acres in extent, which is a larger acreage than any Parish or District in the Metropolis, with the exception of the Wandsworth District and the Plumstead District, with which this Board is joined, and the combined Districts of Plumstead and Lewisham have an area of 16,938 statute acres, being less than one-fourth but considerably more than one-fifth of the acreage of the whole Metropolis, including the City of London, the acreage of your Memorialists' District (6,544 acres) being more than equal to the combined acreage of 17 of the Parishes and Districts of the Metropolis sending 17 Members to your Honourable Board. 10. Your Memorialists have been informed that your Honourable Board are reluctant, at the present time, to enter into any question with regard to an alteration of the representation at your Honourable Board, owing to the expectation of some large and comprehensive Government Scheme for the creation of a new Metropolitan Municipality in the place of the existing authorities; but your Memorialists respectfully submit that it is the duty of the present authorities to perform their work without regard to any schemes that may hereafter be brought forward, and which schemes, it cannot be forgotten, have been promised for years, but have 16 always been postponed; and provided that yon consider the claim of your Memorialists to be directly represented at your Honourable Board a right and just one, that you will, without regard to any such schemes, endeavour to do justice to your present constituents; and your Memorialists would even urge that the anticipated change in the Government of the Metropolis is an additional reason why so large and important a District, both in point of population and rateable value, as the District over which this Board exercises its jurisdiction should be directly represented at your Board, in order that when such scheme is brought before you the interests of their District may be adequately represented. Your Memorialists therefore request that your Honourable Board will take an early opportunity to apply to Parliament to authorise such an alteration or increase in the representation of the several Parishes and Districts at the Metropolitan Board of Works as their altered circumstances require, and especially such an alteration or increase as shall provide for the Lewisham District being represented by a separate Member at such Board, or in such other manner as your Honourable Board may think fit. The Common Seal of the Board of Works for the Lewisham District was hereunto affixed, by order, this 7th day of November, 1883, in the presence of H. S. WINNETT, Clerk to the Board. 1883—84.

WRIGHT, Secretary to the Board. 22nd September, 1884- R E P O R T to The Board of Works for the Lewishamj District, TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1883, by F. EACHUS WILKINSON, M.D., &c., Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The population of the Lewisham District, estimated to the middle of the year 1883, amounted to 77,572, residing in 12,361 houses. Table I. gives the estimated population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place in the District during the year 1883 and the 10 previous years. Table II. gives the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates at the public institutions in the District for the same periods. Table III. gives the deaths registered at several groups of ages from different causes during the year. Table IV. gives the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and the proportion to population, and to 1,000 deaths in 1883. Table V. gives the number of deaths in the 10 years, 1873 to 1882 inclusive, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in the year 1883. 2 Table VI. gives the Inspectors’ Reports of the sanitary work completed during the year. Table VII. gives the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population in 1883, with the birth and death rate in the Registrar's Sub-districts in the Lewisham Parish, and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising "the Lewisham District." Table VIII. gives the area, the census population in the years 1871 and 1881, the estimated population in 1883, and the mortality in various Metropolitan Districts, and in England and Wales, &c. Table IX. gives the population, the number of persons to an acre of ground, the number of births and deaths, the mean temperature and rainfall in London and 27 large towns of the United Kingdom, and in the Lewisham District. Table X. The number of children attending public elementary and certified efficient schools in the Pariah of Lewisham and in the Hamlet of Penge during the year 1883. Table XI. A Register of the licensed cow-houses in the District, together with a list of the milk sellers in the District who have no licenses. Table XII. A list of the licensed slaughter-houses in the District. Marriages. During the year 1883, 377 Marriages took place in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 314 were solemnized in the several Church of England Churches, 43 in Dissenting Chapels, and 20 at the Registrar's Office. One hundred and twenty-seven Marriages took place in the Hamlet of Penge, of which 106 were solemnized in 3 Church of England Churches, 16 in Dissenting Chapels, and 5 at the Registrar's Office. Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1883 amounted to 2,340. Males 1,206. Females 1,134. The Birth Rate to population was 30.16 per 1,000. In London 133,656 births were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 33.9 per 1,000, being the lowest birth rate for 20 years, that is, since 1862, in which year the rate was 34.2. In England and Wales 889,815 were registered, the annual Birth Rate being 33 2 per 1,000. The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths in the Lewisham district was 1,288. Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1883 was 1,052, being 40 less than the number registered during the previous year. The annual rate of mortality per 1,000 was 13.56. The annual rate of mortality of England and Wales in the year 1883 was 19.5. In the Metropolitan and City Police Districts 19.7. In Registration London, 20.4; and in the district outside Registration London, 167 per 1,000. By reference to Table III., which gives the mortality registered at several groups of ages, it will be seen that, of the 1,052 Deaths registered from all causes in 1883, 419 4 died under the age of 5 years, of which number 307 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 307 deaths occurred under 1 year of age. 52 between the ages of 1 and 2 60 „ „ 2 „ 5 52 „ „ 5 „ 15 44 „ „ 15 „ 25 65 „ „ 25 „ 35 81 „ „ 35 „ 45 68 „ „ 45 „ 55 95 „ „ 55 „ 65 116 „ „ 65 „ 75 90 „ „ 75 „ 85 21 „ „ 85 „ 95 1 „ „ 95 and upwards.

Water Supply. With regard to Water supply, the important question for the Sanitary Authority is not only its sufficient quantity, and its proper filtration and purity, before distribution, but to see that the cisterns for storing water are placed in accessible situations, in order that they may be readily and frequently cleansed, and to see that no contamination takes place from any connection with the water closet, or between the overflow pipe of the cistern and the drain. 5 The Board of Trade regulations, 1872, relative to waste pipes, provide that no overflow or waste pipe, other than a warning pipe, shall be attached to any cistern supplied with water by a company. Sewer Gases. Continued watchful care is required to prevent the ingress of foul air, the product of sewer putrefaction, permeating into dwellings. Houses are constantly found which communicate with drains by waste pipes, soil pipes constructed within the house, cesspools, drains, and, at times, overflow pipes, sink pipes, bath pipes, and lavatory basin pipes, and although supposed to be secured by traps, fail to keep out poisonous gases laden with the germs of infection. A great deal of trouble has been taken to get these dangers prevented in the construction of new houses in the district, but constant supervision is requisite. No soil pipe should be constructed within a house, and should always be ventilated, and no house should, by means of drains, in any way communicate with a sewer, but should have its connection broken between the house and drain traps and terminate by a free end into the open air outside the house. Cow Houses and Dairies. As milk often constitutes the sole diet of infants and invalids, it becomes of the most serious importance that this nutritious food should be of a pure quality. The surroundings of cow-houses and dairies should be kept scrupulously clean, and in the event of any case of sickness amongst the cows, the animal should be kept separate from others, and the milk from the diseased animal thrown away. 6 The attendance upon cows by those who have recently been the subject of epidemic diseases, should be forbidden. The water used for the washing of cans must also be of a pure description, and not drawn from a dirty cistern or well. The requirements for cow-houses are, that—There must be a cubic space of 800 feet for each cow; the sides and flooring of the cow-house must be of some solid and impervious material; there must be proper light and ventilation; proper paving and drainage of the cow-house and adjoining yard; a good water supply; a properly constructed dung-pit; and a clean, covered, impervious receptacle for grains. The cowhouses must be cleansed, and the manure removed therefrom twice daily; and all refuse removed from the premises at least three times a week before 7 a.m. The Board's Hospital. The Hospital for the reception of patients suffering from epidemic disease is now the freehold property of the Board of Works of the Lewisham District, and the new building is now completed. It is well situated, being in a locality far away from inhabited houses and at a good elevation, and has a Resident Nurse ready for the reception of patients. Ambulances are kept at Lewisham and Penge, for the conveyance of patients suffering from infectious disease. The importance of this establishment cannot be overestimated, for whenever a case of epidemic disease is removed in order to prevent its communication to others, it confers a benefit to the general public. On this ground the payment for the maintenance and medical attendance should be as low as possible to the friends of the patient. 7 In accordance with this view, by a Resolution of the Board, dated 23rd June, 1880, the payment was fixed at one guinea per week, such charge to include maintenance and medical attendance. The charge for the ambulance is only the actual cost incurred in each case for horse hire. Disinfection. One disinfecting apparatus, for the purpose of disinfecting the wearing apparel, bedding, &c., of those who have suffered from epidemic disease, is placed at Lewisham, and another at Penge. Covered iron carts are in readiness to fetch and deliver apparel, &c Latrines. The establishment of Latrines in the district has been under consideration. Baths. The Commissioners for the purpose of erecting Public Baths in the Parish of Lewisham, have during the year commenced the erection of Baths at Forest Hill and Ladywell, and it is anticipated that great good will result to the inhabitants from the use of the Baths when completed. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. E. WILKINSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the Lewisham District. 8 TABLE I.

Gentlemen, It is with much pleasure I submit the following Report of Work executed in my department during the past financial year. HIGHWAYS. The following Table will give the quantity of material paid for during the year for the maintenance of the Public Roads in the District:— Division. Granite. Port Philip Stone. Dug Flints. Picked Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Parish (cubic yards) 4960 948 3218 ... 2056 11,182 Hamlet of Penge (ditto) 1040 ... ... 862' 680 2582 Total 6000 948 3218 862 2736 13,764 The rainfall from the 26th March, 1883, to the 25th March, 1884, inclusive, as read at the rain.guage at the Stone Yard, Forest Hill, was as follows:— Number of days on which rain fell. INCHES. 4 1883 March 26th to 31st inclusive 0.12 9 April 1.66 10 May 1.61 11 June 0.94 11 July 1.71 9 August 0.52 18 September 2.83 12 October 1.65 19 November 2.83 10 December 0.55 16 1884 January 1.90 10 February 1.12 7 March, to 25th inclusive 1.15 146 18.59 2 From this statement it will appear that rain fell upon 146 days, and 6.26 inches less rain fell this year than last year. The roads at the present time are in a good condition, and I think I may venture to say the Board have maintained throughout the year their old reputation of keeping good roads. I am not aware of a single complaint being made of insufficient or bad roads. There have been 6 slop carts purchased during the year, to replace old ones and for the better carrying out of the work of slopping, which must necessarily be extended as the District increases. A saving in the estimated quantity of granite was effected. ROAD WATERING. The principal part of the work of watering the roads in Blackheath was done by horses supplied by Mr. Thomas Lane, of Rushey Green, at a contract price of 9s. per day, which included harness and a driver. In Lewisham, Rushey Green, and Southend, the work was done by horses belonging to the Board and men in the employ of the Board. In Sydenham and Forest Hill, Mr. Wm. Stimpson supplied horses at 8s. 8d. per day, which included the driver together with the harness. In the Lower Sydenham Division, Messrs. W. and J. Woodham did the work at 8s. 6d. per day, for horse, driver, and harness. In the Hamlet of Penge, Mr. Wm. Winnifrith watered the roads at a contract price of 8s. 3d. per horse, driver, and harness. The Board in all cases supplied the water waggon or cart. Throughout the watering season, the supply of water in the Kent Water Company's District was good, and the supply from the Lambeth Water Company better than formerly. The Kent Water Company reduced their price for water for road watering £5 a mile. Upon the 29th of June, 1883, and 25th January, 1884, I made reports to the Works and General Purposes Committee upon the subject of paying for the water used for road watering by meter measurement, in place of a fixed rate per mile as at present. Hitherto, the Companies have raised objections, but I expect some arrangement will be come to in the case of the Lambeth Water Company. The Sydenham Hill Road was watered by the Board under arrangement with the Cambenvell \ estry, as also the Greenwich Boundary Roads by arrangement 3 with the Greenwich Board of Works. The following table will give the number of miles of road watered in each Division of the District. Locality. Miles. Yards. Blackheath and Lewisham 20 39 Sydenham and Forest Hill 20 1077 Hamlet of Penge 10 1214 Total 51 570 STREET LIGHTING. At present there are in the Parish of Lewisham G84 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company and G45 lamps lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company. In the Hamlet of Penge there are 359 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. The present charges for lightingstreet lamps are as follows:—The Crystal Palace District Gas Company £3 12s. 4d. per lamp per annum, and the South Metropolitan Gas Company £3 12s. 6d. per lamp per annum. These charges include lighting, extinguishing, cleaning, &c. The columns are paid for in addition and are the property of the Board. During the year the Crystal Palace District Gas Company reduced the price 3s. 2d. per lamp per annum, 1s. 7d. in March and 1s. 7d. in September; the South Metropolitan Gas Company in December reduced the price 4s. 6d. per lamp per annum. The following will show the new Lamps erected:— Lewisham. Amberley Road 1 Bampton Road 1 Berlin Road 1 Berryman's Lane 1 Blackheath Park (road leading to) 1 Bradgate Road 3 Brockley Cottages 1 Charleville Circus 2 Colfe Road 1 Commerford Road 2 Dermody Road 1 Elthruda Road 2 Exbury Road 1 4 Lewisham— Continued.

St. Hugh's Road 2 Stembridge Road 2 Stodart Road 1 Waldegrave Road 1 Total 6 There were 25 lamps removed to more suitable positions in the Parish of Lewisham, and 11 lamps in the Hamlet of Penge. Three of the old burners to the obelisk lamp were done away with in High Street, Lewisham (at the turning to Lee Road), and three of Bray's flat flame burners substituted. Upon the 21st of February the South Metropolitan Gas Company wrote to the Board, saying that in all cases where lamps were more than the statutory distance apart (75 yards) an additional sum would be charged in respect of such lamps. I am preparing a Register of the distance apart of the lamps in the South Metropolitan Gas Company's District, and also a special 5 plan showing the position of the same. This, of course, though of undoubted utility, involves a great deal of labour. COLLECTION OF DUST, &c. In the Parish of Lewisham the Dust and Ashes were collected by horses and carts belonging to the Board, an additional horse occasionally being hired. The Parish was divided into five Districts, and the Dust disposed of by Contract, as follows:— Lewisham Parish. No. of District or Locality. Contract Price per Load. Name of Contractor. s. d. No. 1. Blackheath, Loampit Yale, &c. 0 5 Mr. Wm. Jerrard. No. 2. Lewisham up to Rushey Green 1 9 Mr. H. Drewett. No. 3. Catford, Perry Hill, &c 0 8 Mr. Batchelor. No. 3a. North of Stanstead Road 1 0 Messrs. Strong. No. 4. Upper Sydenham, Sydenham Road, &c 0 9 The Beckenham and Penge Brickworks. In the Hamlet of Penge the work of collecting Ashes, &c., was done by horses and carts hired from Mr. Winnifrith at a contract price of 5s. Od. per horse, harness, and cart per day. The men and boys being in the employ of the Board. The Hamlet was divided into two Districts, and the Ashes, &c., disposed of as shown in the following Table:— Hamlet of Penge. No. of District or Locality. Contract Price per Load. Name of Contractor. s. d. No. 1. West of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway 0 6 The Beckenham and Penge Brickworks. No. 2. East of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway 0 9 Messrs. Featherby and Co. In Lewisham there were 7654 loads collected, and in the Hamlet of Penge 3958 loads. It may be well to state that the carts used in Penge are much smaller than those used in Lewisham. The collection and disposal of dust is becoming a more difficult question to deal with. As the vacant land is built upon the shoots are more difficult to obtain, and I fear in a few years 6 it will be a more expensive matter to collect and dispose of the dust than at present. BOARD'S HORSES. This year was the most unfortunate we have ever had in the matter of Horses. Four were lost: one by an accident in shooting slop; two were slaughtered, one from a diseased hoof and the other from old age and a tendency to farcy. The fourth Horse was taken with meagrims one very hot day, in the Southend Road, fell down, and died. New horses were purchased to bring the stud up to twenty-one. From a report I made to the Board (Minutes, 1884, page 26) it appears the Board, in sixteen years, on an average, have lost one horse a year. This contrasts very favourably with the losses of other horse-keepers. I discontinued using the Dutch or German Moss Litter during the year. Straw became much cheaper and the Moss was sent of an inferior quality, consequently there was no saving in its use. The Board purchased the green-meat by the acre from the grower, and a considerable saving was made by doing this. There was no epidemic in the stables during the year. NEW WORKS.

ROAD IMPROVEMENTS. There were not many improvements carried out or discussed during the year. The most important was the extension of Thurston Road to Mill Lane, Deptford. The widening of the Road near " Rosenthal," Rushey Green, was completed. I made a plan for widening the footpath of Jews' Walk, Sydenham, at the junction with Wells Road, which would have been of great public advantage, but it was given up on account of the compensation asked. An improvement was carried out in Dermody Road, Lewisham, by cutting off an elbow of the Road. NEW STREETS.

The Sewers named in this Table make collectively 2927 feet run of 3 feet G inches by 2 feet 4 inches brick and concrete sewer, 2568 feet run of 18 inch pipe sewer, 3797 feet run of 15 inch pipe sewers, and 10,057 feet run of 12 inch pipe sewers, in addition to those already maintained by the Board. Probably the most important sewer completed during the year was the 18-inch pipe from Adenmore Gardens, Catford, to the brick sewer in Brockley Lane. The work was carried out by Messrs. Bath and Blackmore. The pipes were laid on a cushion of cement concrete. As I expected a good deal of water from the river I had all the joints caulked with tow, and it answered very well. A great deal of time was taken up during the year in investigating the cause of the unpleasant smell arising from the ventilators ol the Westbourne Road, Church Yale, and Perry Vale Sewers. My reports upon the subject will be found at pages 238 and 279 oi the printed Minutes, 1883. In these reports I state, as my opinion, that the hot liquor discharged from Messrs. Morgan Brothers Brewery was, to a large extent, the cause of the smells complained of. Notice has been given to Messrs. Morgan to keep down the 11 temperature of the liquor flowing from their Brewery to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (see my Report, Minutes, 1883, page 279). During the summer the Sewers were more frequently cleansed and disinfected than they had ever been. New Maps were prepared showing the Sewers in Lewisham and Penge, together with the side entrances, manholes, and ventilators. I have prepared the Table below showing the numbers of Houses built and drained; also the number of gullies, ventilators, and manholes constructed in existing Sewers during the year:— Locality. No. of Houses sanctioned to be Built and Drained. No. of Houses, &c., sanctioned to be Drained. No. of Additions to Buildings sanctioned. No. of Dwelling Houses and Public Buildings, &c., completed within the year. No. of Frontage Drains laid. No. of Gullies constructed in Public Roads. No. of Flushing Chambers constructed. No. of Ventilators constructed. Lewisham Parish 499 100 41 413 153 22 6 7 Hamlet of Penge 97 32 17 113 25 1 1 0 SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE.

A road was sanctioned during the year in continuation of Brownhill Road to Hither Green Lane. This will be a most convenient road to the public. Between Lee Green and Rushey Green it will save a great distance. Forty-one Lime Trees were planted at Rushey Green, in the west footpath of High Road; 21 on Lewisham Hill; and 20 at Tranquil Yale and Royal Parade, Blackheath. 12 PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. The following bills were deposited affecting the District:— 1. East of London, Crystal Palace, and South Eastern Junction Railway. 2. London, Chatham, and Dover (Shortlands to Nunhead) Railway. 3. South Eastern Metropolitan (Lewisham, Greenwich, District) Tramways Bill. 4. South East Metropolitan Tramways. 5. Peckham and East Dulwich Tramways. The East of London, Crystal Palace, and South Eastern Junction was a Scheme to construct a Railway from Ladywell Station into the grounds of the Crystal Palace. The Line would have destroyed a good deal of valuable property about Forest Hill and Sydenham; and the long viaducts and narrow bridges were most objectionable. Nearly the whole of the distance from Brockley Lane to Devonshire Road was made up by viaducts. The Bill was thrown out by the Committee of the House of Commons. London, Chatham and Dover (Shortlands to Nunhead) Railway. This was a short line from Nunhead to Shortlands. The bridges were objectionable. The Bill was also thrown out by the Committee of the House of Commons. South Eastern Metropolitan (Lewisham, Greenwich, and District) Tramway Bill. These Tramways commenced with the existing Tramway in London Street, Greenwich, and from the top of Loampit Hill joining at Lewisham Bridge, and thence to Southend. The Board gave their consent to the construction of them. The Metropolitan Board of Works would not consent to the construction of the tramway from Loampit Hill to Lewisham Bridge. The Promoters withdrew, on account of opposition, that portion of the Tramway from Rushey Green to Southend. The Tramway as it at present stands, is from London Street, Greenwich, to Rushey Green, and it is expected the work of laying it will soon commence. South East Metropolitan Tramways. The Tramways were from the New Cross Road ("Marquis of Granby"), and from London Street, Greenwich, to Rushey Green, joining at Lewisham Bridge. The Board would not give their consent, and the Bill was withdrawn. 13 Peckham and East Dulwich Tramways. The Tramways were from Peckham by way of London Road and Stanstead Road, and over Catford Bridge to Rushey Green. This Bill was also withdrawn, as the Board would not give their consent. LEWISHAM PARISH BOUNDARY. The boundary of Lewisham Parish was walked upon the 24th, 25th, and 26th of May. This had not been done for years, and it took many days for me to find the old boundary marks, some of which, as shown upon the Ordnance Survey, could not be found. Certain encroachments had taken place which were duly noted and set right. New iron boundary posts were put up and new iron plates, under my instructions, by the direction of the Overseers of Lewisham Parish. I walked the whole of the boundary. FLOODING, FRONTAGE LINES, &c. During the year there was no flooding to speak of in the Ravensbourne, Poole, or Quaggy Rivers. In the course of the year fifteen applications relative to Frontage Lines were sent from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works for suggestions, and 105 plans and tracings prepared in my office, together with a large number of reports, estimates, and letters written. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble Servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst., Surveyor to the Board. The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. 14 NEW STREETS SANCTIONED.
