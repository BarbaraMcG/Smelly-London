ANNUAL REPORT. 1914. To the Chairman and Members of the Brentford Urban District Council. April 4th, 1915. Gentlemen. I beg to present my report upon the health and sanitary condition of the Brentford Urban Sanitary District for the year 1914. POPULATION I estimate the population to the middle of June to be : Old Brentford 14903, and New Brentford 2137, making a total of 17040. BIRTHS. The number of births has been 466, of which 236 were males, and 230 females, which is 15 lower than last year, when it was 481 and 19.3 lower than the average of the last 10 years. The birth rate is 27.3 per thousand. There were also 12 children born of Brentford women outside the town, and the total birth rate is 28 per thousand. 19 of these births, viz., 13 inside the town and 6 outside were illegitimate. DEATHS. The number of deaths occurring in Brentford during the year has been 165, of which 80 were males and 85 females. In Old Brentford 137 and in New Brentford 28, the death rates of which were respectively, Old Brentford 9.1 per thousand, and New Brentford 13.1 per thousand. The Cottage Hospital is in New Brentford where 2 deaths occurred, and the Isolation Hospital in Old Brentford where there were 6 deaths. The death rate for the whole district is 9.6 per thousand. Included in this return are 2 nonresidents, viz., 1 in the Cottage Hospital, and one on the Canal bank, so that the correct death rate for residents who died in Brentford is 9.5 per thousand, being exactly the same as last year. 4 CORRECTED DEATH RATE I have been supplied with particulars of 82 deaths of inhabitants of Brentford who have died outside the town during the year. 72 of these lived in Old Brentford and 10 in New Brentford and the outside death rate is 4.8 per thousand. These when added to the 163 who died in the town, gives a total of 245, which I believe is a true account of the number of deaths which Brentford suffered during the year, and gives a total death rate of 14.3 per thousand. The following table gives the corrected death rate since 1905 when I was first supplied with a list of residents of Brentford who died outside the town. 190S 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 17.6 17 19.2 14.9 14.9 13 3 17.4 11.3 138 14.3 They died in the following institutions :— Brentford Workhouse Infirmary . 49 West London Hospital 9 Middlesex County Asylum 4 Richmond Hospital 3 Other London Hospitals and places 17 14 of these deaths were caused by cancer, 12 heart disease, and 11 tuberculosis. INQUESTS. Fourteen inquests have been held. In 1912 the number was 13, in 1911, 20, in 1910, 21, and in 1909, 25. Death resulted from pneumonia in 3 cases, heart disease and aneurism in 2 each, fracture of skull in 2, and tuberculosis, burns, asphyxia, apoplexy, and cancer, 1 each. The following table epitomises the ages at which death occurred : Under 1 year 45 1 and under 5 years 22 5 .. 15 „ 8 15 25 „ 5 25 65 „ 35 Over 65 ,, 50 67 under 5 years. 98 over 5 years. 14 of these deaths occurred in persons over 80 and 1 was over 90 years old. 5 INFANT MORTALITY. The rate of this mortality or the proportion of deaths under 1 year to every 1ooo births inside the town is 96.5. Last year it was 101.8 The average for the last 10 years is 119.5 so that it is 23 below the average and is lower than in any year except 1912. If to the 45 deaths which occurred in the town under 1 year old we add 5 deaths occurring outside the town, we get a total of 50 deaths, and a death rate of 104 8 per thousand births inside and outside the town. In analysing the causes of these deaths, I find 11 were born prematurely, 5 died within a week of birth from debility, and 3 from congenital defects. Diarrhoea caused 9 deaths and diseases of the respiratory organs, 6. It is satisfactory to note that the infant mortality is again low which is to be principally attributed to the cool summer, but I hope also in some measure to the unceasing care and attention which now has been paid for many years to housing, prevention of overcrowding and instructions in the feeding and care of infants. The following table gives the rate and average infant mortality for the last 10 years. 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 Average for 10 years "5 140.7 113.6 120.6 102.5 106.4 158.9 74.4 101.8 96.5 "3 The following are the deaths from the principal zymotic diseases. SMALL POX—None. MEASLES.—Nine. SCARLET FEVER—One. WHOOPING COUGH.—Three. DIPHTHERIA AND MEMBRANOUS CROUP.—Seven. TYPHUS FEVER—None. ENTERIC FEVER—None. DIARRHCEA AND ENTERITIS.—Ten. The number of deaths from these 8 zymotic diseases has been 30 and the zymotic death rate is 1.7 per thousand which is exactly the same as last year, and..4 below the average of the last 10 years. In the last quarter of the year there was a very severe outbreak of measles causing much distress and 9 deaths, and I must again point out the necessity of keeping. the little patients warm in bed so as to avoid having complications as far as possible. The 10 deaths from diarrhoea, 4 of which occurred in September, is much too high considering the cool summer, and too much care cannot be taken in keeping feeding bottles in clean cold water when not in use, and thoroughly washing them immediately after being used; also in preventing flies from getting into the milk. 6 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 Average for 10 years.

This is the 2nd year of the compulsory notification of pulmonary tuberculosis and the following figures have been extracted from the register of notification of Pulmonary, and other forms of tuberculosis. Form A.—Notification under Article V. i.e. of cases not previously notified 50 ,, B.—Notification by School Medical Inspector of cases not previously notified by him 1 „ C.—Notification by Medical Officer of Poor Law Institutions and Sanatoria under Article VII. (a) of patients who have been notified before admission 16 „ D.—Notification (after discharge) by Medical Officer of Poor Law Institutions and Sanitoria under Article VII. (b) 14 Notifications transferred to other districts 9 Total number of notifications received 90 Deduct transferred notifications 9 Nett number of notifications 81 7 Analysis of Notifications. 36 patients have been notified once 36 10 „ „ ,, twice 20 6 „ „ „ three times 18 1 patient has been notified seven times 7 53 81 Transferred notification 9 90 Last year the nett number of notifications was 118 for 75 patients and the difference of 37 is made up by 19 less in Form A, 8 less in Form C and 10 less in Form D. The marked diminution in the number of patients notified is probably to be accounted for by the fact that the Act only came into force last year when everybody was notified. HOUSING, AND TOWN PLANNING &c. ACT. 1909. INSANITARY PROPERTY. During the past year 16 houses (excluding those which were under consideration at the end of last year) have been reported as being unfit for habitation, of which 10 were voluntarily closed by the owners upon representation being made to them by the Inspector, acting under the instructions of the Sanitary Committee, and 6 are at present occupied. The tenants have however, with 2 exceptions, received notice to quit and so soon as they have given up possession the same will be demolished. It has not been found necessary to make closing orders in respect of any houses, the owners voluntarily closing the same upon the condition being brought to their notice, and I think you will agree with me that this speaks well for the methods adopted by the Health Department. The following is an epitome of the insanitary property dealt with during the year under review. Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, The Ham I inspected these houses in company with the Inspector, who submitted a record of his inspection to the Committee. The owner was communicated with, who, after viewing the property decided not to attemrpt to repair. 8 Numbers 1, 3 and 5 are closed and the doors and window openings have since been bricked up. The owner is now considering whether or no to repair Nos. 7 and 9. Nos. 1 and 2, Vine Cottages, The Hollows. The Inspector reported that these houses were in a dilapidated and insanitary condition and unfit for human habitation, but before making closing orders the Committee instructed the Inspector to communicate with the owners. The Inspector met the owner's surveyor on the property who agreed as to the condition of the houses, and on the application of the owner the Council consented to allow the subject to stand over for a while as it was their intention to demolish the houses for an improvement scheme. Owing to the war the scheme was not proceeded with and the owners have now given the tenants notice to quit. Nos. 1 and 2, Bradshaw's Yard. A record of the inspection of these houses was submitted to the Committee but before making closing orders the Inspector was instructed to communicate with the owner, who, after viewing the property, decided to close the houses. The tenants have received notice to quit. Nos. 9 and 10, Orchard Road. These houses were reported by the Inspector to be in a bad condition and upon the attention of the owner's agent being called thereto the occupiers were given notice to quit. The owner has since submitted plans showing the proposed alterations to the property, these have been approved, and the work will be put in hand shortly. Nos. 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30, The Ham. The owners have voluntarily closed these houses and the window and door openings have been bricked up. The houses are situated on the bank of the Grand Junction Canal, and owing to their situation they are constantly liable to flooding. The following particulars which have been supplied to me by Mr. H. Coleman, the Officer appointed under the Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act., show that during the past eight years 279 dwelling houses have been reported as being unfit for human habitation, and dealt with under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and the Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act. 9 38 dwelling houses were closed by order of the Justices. 59 dwelling houses were closed by order of the Council under Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act. 152 dwelling houses were voluntarily closed by owners, upon representation being made by the Inspector without the necessity of making closing orders. 30 dwelling houses in hand at the end of the year (1914). Total 279 The records show that they were dealt with as follows:— 53 dwelling houses were repaired and rendered habitable (including one in respect of which a closing order made under the Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act, was revoked). 196 dwelling houses were demolished; of these, 135 were demolished voluntarily, and 61 upon receipt of demolition orders made under the Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act. 30 dwelling houses still remain standing, of which 21 are unoccupied and the remaining 9 were occupied at the end of the year. Total 279 DEMOLITION OF INSANITARY PROPERTY. During the past year, two houses in Chapel Alley, oft High Street, which were mentioned in my previous report, have been demolished voluntarily. During the same period two houses have been erected on the site formerly occupied by Nos. 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16, Pottery Road, which were demolished in 1910. Representation has been made to the owner of the property in Back Lane and Troy Town, requesting them to demolish the houses, which have been unoccupied for several years, and I have every reason to believe that this will be done shortly. The following table shows the number of buildings which have been erected on the sites of premises demolished during the past 8 years. 10 Site. Flats.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE (NOTIFICATION) ACT. Under this Act I have received 243 notifications, being an increase of 159 as compared with last year. The following table shows the number of notifications received from Medical Practitioners during the various months of the year. It will be observed that Ophthalmia Neonatorum, having been made a notifiable disease this year, is now included.

I am pleased to report that it has not been found necessary to close any of the Schools on account of Epidemic Diseases. 14 CONCLUSION. I have again to express my thanks to the Head Teachers of the various Public Elementary Schools for the prompt and invaluable aid they have rendered me in supplying me with information of suspected infectious disease. This year it was especially required, as in the Autumn a sudden outbreak of Scarlet Fever occurred in the Infant Department of St. Paul's School, and but for the energetic action of the Head Mistress, Miss Cole, I fear the whole town would have become involved. Happily by constant inspection of the children in the School, and by visiting those who were away, I was able to confine the outbreak to the original site. I also wish to thank Sister Lucas and the Staff of the Cottage Hospital for the care and attention they have given during the past year to the sick and suffering poor of the town. The Cottage Hospital has been established now for so many years that it is difficult to realize the condition of the poor when they had only to rely on their own unskilled efforts, and there is no doubt the improved death rate and Infant mortality is due in a large degree to the devoted care and attention of the Nurses. I am happy to record that Mr. Coleman, the Sanitary Inspector, is still working whole heartedly and energetically in carrying out his various important duties, and the entire absence of friction, and constant improvement in the sanitary condition of the town is the best proof of his efficiency. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. BOTT, Medical Officer of Health. 15 TABLE I. Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1914 and previous years.

EIGHTH Annual Report of the Sanitary Inspector. 19 14. 22 Public Health Department, Brentford, April 4th 1915. To the Chairman and Members of the Brentford Urban District Council. Gentlemen, Pursuant to the Order of the Local Government Board, I have the honour to present to you my EIGHTH Annual Report, forming a record of the work done in connection with the inspection of the District during the year 1914. INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. The total number of inspections made to premises during the year was 2718. House to house inspections, inspection of Canal Boats, the testing of drainage, sanitary fittings and supervision of drainage work, inspection of Common Lodging Houses, dairies, cowsheds and milkshops, workshops, slaughter houses, bake houses and premises whereon foods are deposited, prepared, or exposed for sale, have all received my attention. Visits have also been made to houses where cases of Infectious Disease have occurred, under the directions of the Medical Officer of Health. An extra amount of work was thrown on my Department in consequence of the severe outbreak of Infectious Disease, and was felt more acutely by reason of the absence of Mr. C. S. Brock, who has joined His Majesty's Forces. It is gratifying to again record that I still invariably receive the co-operation of property owners and their agents in my endeavour to improve the conditions of the poorer residents of the Town, work being done, in almost every case immediately on attention being called to the necessity. A considerable amount of time is taken up with clerical work and in interviewing persons at the office or on property, in addition to the specific matters enumerated in this Report. 23 INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND DISINFECTION. During the year 242 cases of Infectious Disease have been investigated and reported upon to the Medical Officer of Health. The precautions taken to prevent the spread of diseases were as follows:— 195 rooms were disinfected after removal, recovery or death of patient, 33 library and other books taken from infected houses were disinfected, 3 schools were disinfected, and 110 infected rooms were stripped and cleansed as required by Section 5 of the Infectious Disease Prevention Act 1890. 554 exclusion notices were sent, 171 to the County Medical Officer, 167 to the School Attendance Officer, 4 to School Attendance Officers without the District and 212 to Head Masters and Mistresses of the various Schools within and without the district. * Patient removed to Isleworth Infirmary, t Two of these patients removed to Isleworth Infirmary.

In the construction of new drains, stoneware or heavy ironcoated pipes laid in concrete are always used. Means for procuring the efficient ventilation of drains are provided and they are disconnected from the sewer by the use of an intercepting trap. The hydraulic test is applied to all new drains before and after the filling in of the ground and the soil and ventilating pipes are tested by air pressure. Plans, in all cases, are insisted upon, and these, which are kept and filed, form a complete record of the work carried out in the District. 25 OFFENSIVE TRADES. Regular inspections of the premises where offensive trades are carried on have been made, and they are, so far as the nature of the business will allow, kept in a cleanly manner. In addition to the offensive trades enumerated in Section 112 of the Public Health Act 1875, the Council have, by virtue of the powers given them by Section 51 of the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1890, added the trades of Fish Frying, Gut Scraping and Rag and Bone Dealing, but no applications were received for the consent of the Council to establish any of these trades. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS & MILKSHOPS. There are three cowkeepers, five dairymen and forty-eight purveyors of milk on the register. Three applications for registration as retailers of milk, and one to be registered as a cowkeeper, have been received and reported upon during the year. Inspections have been frequently made to the dairies, cowsheds and milkshops, particular attention being paid to cleanliness. The cows in the district are inspected quarterly by the Council's Veterinary Inspector. COMMON LODGING HOUSES The number of common lodging houses in the district, as will be seen from the following table, remains the same as in 1913, viz. 6, and these houses contain 29 rooms and can accommodate 171 lodgers nightly. Frequent inspections have been made and no cause for complaint has been found. It is again worthy of note that no cases of infectious disease have been notified at, or traced to, any of the lodging houses.

The number of Registered and Licensed Slaughter Houses in the district remains the same as last year, viz.:—8, one of these being solely used for the purpose of slaughtering horses and cattle not intended for human consumption. They have been kept under constant observation and the necessary steps have been taken to secure proper compliance with the bye-laws, particular attention being directed to cleanliness, removal of garbage, limewashing. etc. The visits to these premises have been timed as far as possible to take place when slaughtering is likely to be in progress. In several instances the organs of animals were found to be affected with disease or other affection, and these were destroyed upon attention being called to their condition. The premises wherein food is exposed, kept or deposited for the purpose of sale, have been kept under close and careful supervision and it affords me great pleasure to record the fact that the butchers, fishmongers and general dealers have shown a desire to co-operate with the Department by submitting for my examination, any attide of food as to the condition of which they are in doubt. During the year 108 articles of food were examined, of these, 89 were surrendered, 16 came under my observation and in three instances seizures were made in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875, and the Public Health Acts Amend, ment Act 1890, and in each of these cases orders were obtained from a Justice of the Peace to destroy the food so as to prevent it being used for the food of man. In 2 instances legal proceedings were ordered to be taken, one for exposing for sale, and the other for selling unsound meat. The Defendant was convicted and fined £5, and ordered to pay £2. 2s. od. costs. The following table shows the amount of food destroyed during the past year. 27 No. Article of food.

Four summonses were issued during the year for various offences under the Public Health and Canal Boats Acts, and in each instance a conviction was recorded. Other prosecutions were ordered but proceedings were stayed as the nuisances were abated or the work required to be done was put in hand after intimation of intended proceedings had been given to the persons concerned.

During the year 36 canal boats were inspected. I am pleased to report that the condition of the boats and their occupants was satisfactory. Ten infringements of the Acts and Regulations were detected, all of which, with one exception have been rectified. They are as follows : Defective cabin floor 1 Insufficient ventilation to cabin 1 Boats not properly marked 3 Boats not registered 1 No certificate on board 1 Defective water vessel 1 Obstructing Inspector 1 Refusing to product- certificate of registration 1 In one instance it was found necessary to institute legal proceedings against the captain of the boat "Jeannie," No. 1282 Birmingham, for obstructing the Inspector in the execution of his duty, and failing to produce the certificate of registration when requested so to do. The defendant was fined 20/- and 10/respectively, together with 10/ costs, or in default one month's imprisonment. Four complaint notes were issued, three of which have been signed and returned. Likewise, I have signed thirteen complaint notes issued by neighbouring Authorities and attended to various other matters. 3i No cases of Infectious Disease have been notified as occurring amongst the canal boat population and therefore it has not been found necessary to detain any vessel for the purpose of cleansing and disinfection. Six canal boats have been registered during the year. (a) Motor propelled canal boats 2 (b) Other boats 4 One boat (b) which had previously been registered with this Authority was re-registered upon change of ownership. The total number of boats on the register believed to be in use or available is as follows :— (a) Motor propelled boats 6 (b) Other boats 311 317 (c) Boats that cannot be traced 14 (d) Struck off register 5 336 PETROLEUM ACTS 1871-1881, AND ORDERS IN COUNCIL THEREUNDER. During the year fourteen applications for the renewal of Licenses, and three applications to keep petroleum were received and reported upon. In each instance the Licenses were granted on the usual conditions. Seventeen notices were received from owners of motor-cars of their contention to store a quantity of motor spirit, not exceeding sixty gallons, in screw-down two gallon cans, under the provisions of the Secretary of State's Regulation made pursuant to Section 5 of the Locomotives on Highways Act, 1896. The licensed premises, stores and motor garages, have been inspected, and the conditions upon which the licenses were granted have been, with few exceptions, well carried out. The contraventions of the Acts and Regulations detected have formed the subject of special reports to the Council and are as follows:—(1) Storing petrol otherwise than in the licensed store, and (2) keeping petrol in excess of the quantity and not in the manner prescribed by the regulations made by the Secretary of State. 32 There are seventeen licensed stores in the district covering 5,575 gallons and the following table shows the uses to which the petroleum is applied:— Manufacturing purposes 3 Partly for sale and partly for use on motor cars 3 For use on motor cars 7 Lighting purposes during night operations on railway 1 For sale only 3 17 Table showing the number of licenses in force and the amount of petroleum covered by each:- 3 licenses cover petroleum up to 1,000 gallons 1 license covers ,, „ 600 ,, 1 „ „ 500 „ 1 „ „ „ „ 360 „ I „ „ „ „ „ 300 „ I „ „ „ „ „ 250 ,, 1 „ „ „ 200 „ 2 licenses cover ,, „ 100 „ 1 license covers „ „ 60 „ 1 „ „ 42 „ 2 licenses cover „ ,, 20 ,, 1 license covers „ „ 18 „ I „ „ „ 5 „ CONCLUSION. In conclusion my thanks are due for the very useful assistance I am the grateful recipient of from all the members of the Council, to the Medical Officer of Health for his guidance and valuable advice, and to the other officers of the Council for their great courtesy and consideration. Under conditions such as these work in the district becomes a pleasure. The sanitary condition of this town is continually improving and to make this fact obvious to the most casual observer is still the endeavour of Your obedient Servant, H. COLEMAN.
