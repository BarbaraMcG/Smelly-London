FRI 20 LIBRARY FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF.HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1942 G. PENNANT EVANS. M.R.C.S. ,L.R.C.P. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FRIERN BARNET URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, N.ll. 16th. August. 1943. To the Chairman and Members of the Friern Barnet. Urban District Council". Gentlemen, This report covers the period from January 1st. 1942, to December 31st. 1942, inclusive, and will be much abbreviated in accordance with Circular 2604, of the 24th. March 1942, and no figures will be given from which the population of the district or its wards, can be inferred, and no data supplied by the Registrar General will be included* The general health of the district was maintained at a high level, and the, incidence of the notifiable diseases has been very satisfactory. In common with other districts, the artificial immunisation against Diphtheria was continued, and 525 immunisations performed, but the public demand slackened towards the end of.the year. However, about 40% of the known child population may be considered to have had this form of protection* This proportion is probably an estimate on the low side,as we have no means of knowing the number of children immunised by private arrangement, or the number immunised before coming to reside in this area* I have to express my best thanks for the good work carried out by the School Medical Officer, Dr. Stephen, in this connection. The death rate this year is rather higher than usual, but it must be born in mind, that our young and virile members of the population are away on war work, and it is only the very young and past middle age, which make up the greater part of the death list. The infantile mortality rate, is the best yet recorded for this district, and reflects the high standard of motherhood necessary for such results. It is also a very striking illustration of the effectiveness of that part of the Food Office organisation which provided the accessory food factors in the form of oil, fruit juices and purees. The birth rate shows a slight upward tendency which is all to the good, for the average age of our population over the past decade has risen, due to the diminished number of births and longevity The housing situation is still acute, greater difficulties arose in getting repairs carried out promptly and efficiently than ever before, and is not likely to diminish until war's demands are satisfied. Scabies has been very prevalent. The Clinic, staffed by the members of the local Red Cross, has done excellent work, and by the end of the year had treated 140 cases to a successful conclusion. A large proportion of these cases were complicated by sepsis, pediculosis and dirt, no less than 421 individual treatments were carried out by the voluntary workers. The Clinic has in evety way justified the Council's decision to establish it. I attach the usual tables of statistics, which show an astonishing amount of good work, carried out by a very attenuated staff, under difficult,' and at times, harassing conditions. I am, Gentlemen, Your obodient servant, G. Pennant Evans. Medical Officer of Health. No. OF DUELLING HOUSES INSPECTED (. seperate primary inspections only).
