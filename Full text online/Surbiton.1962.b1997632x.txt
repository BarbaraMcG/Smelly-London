INTRODUCTION BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Telephone Number; PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Elmbridge 6441-8. Ext. 25. 2, SHALSTON VILLAS, SURBITON. July, 1963. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Annual Report 1962. I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Public Health and Social conditions of the Borough for 1962. The report is compiled in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. l/63 dated 30th January, 1963, and follows very much the same pattern as for previous years. I am very pleased to be able once again to report on the continued satisfactory state of the Public Health in the Borough during the year; there have been no outbreaks of infectious disease. Population; The Registrar General's estimated mid 1962 population figure is given as 63,170, an increase of 320. The vital statistics in this report are based on this figure. Infectious diseases; The number of infectious disease notifications received in 1962 was 102 compared with 960 for 1961. This decrease is due to the greatly reduced number of cases of measles, although the cases of scarlet fever fell from 18 in 1961 to 13 in 1962; cases of whooping cough fell from 13 to 1, although dysentery showed an increase of 12, but is itself a low figure. The number of cases on the Tuberculosis register at the end of the year was 221 against 251 for 1961, and it will be seen that this is the lowest figure on the register for the past ten years. There were no cases of Diphtheria or Poliomyelitis occurring in the Borough during 1962 and with constant active immunisation this trend should continue. Births; The number of live births for 1962 is 977 and compares with 924 for 1961. The birth rate is 15.46 per 1,000 of the population compared with 14.70 for the previous year. There is a continual increase in the number of births taking place annually, and a continuous rise in the total population. There is every indication of this natural increase continuing. Peaths; The number of deaths recorded in 1962 is 654 compared with 664 for 1961. This gives a death rate of 10.35 per thousand of the population compared with 10.56 for 1961. The number of deaths of infants under one year in 1962 is 2. seventeen giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 17.40 compared with a rate of 16.23 for 1961. The causes of death of these infants will be seen on page ten. Causes of death: The main causes of death during 1962 wereiHeart and circulatory disease 253 Cancer 123 Vascular lesions of Nervous System 72 In view of the importance of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer the relevant figures for Surbiton residents are given below. 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 M F M F M F M F M F M F Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus. 19 4 26 3 22 4 34 1 24 5 20 10 Total 23 29 26 35 29 30 This subject has been featured in educational efforts by the department during the year. Your Council with the backing of the Ministries of Health and Education and in co-operation with the Surrey County Council organised and produced campaigns in the town and schools with the object of enlightening young persons of the health hazards of excessive smoking and nicotine addiction. Housing: There is no slackening off in the demand for houses, and if one were to single out a particular group of the population requiring priority for new housing it would be for the newlyweds to have houses to rent. There is still also a continuing need for special provision for elderly persons and a need for better and more effective use of land in development. As I have previously reported, some of the larger houses in the Borough continue to be demolished making way for blocks of flats and maisonettes, but the space between such blocks should be preserved by erecting higher and fewer buildings. Vital Statistics; The vital statistics are favourable, maintaining the satisfactory trend of recent years, and upholding the fact that Surbiton is a good place in which to live and work. 3. Staff? Details of the staff of the Public Health Department are set out on page one. There were two changes during the year, both being on the clerical side, but it was decided only to fill one vacancy and to make certain adjustments to the duties of the existing staff. I am pleased again to record my thanks to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement throughout the year, and to Mr. Sldridge, the Chief Public Health Inspector and his Inspectors, Mr. Sims and the clerical staff and to Dr. W.H. Kinstrie, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.W. STARFEY Medical Officer of Health. 4. ■ GENERAL STATISTICS.

It flanks the river and is close to Epsom Downs, two Royal Parks and Hampton Court Palade. Its population is healthy and it enjoys many physical and social amenities. It is mainly a dormitory town but many of the people are engaged in local industry which comprises a variety of trades in modern factories. There are good shopping centres and exceptionally good communications by road and rail. 5.

The presence of so many in the older age groups means the necessity to co-ordinate, organise and maintain more comprehensive geriatric services and special housing for the old folk. BIRTHS.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Exclusion from work of Contacts of Infectious Disease. By regulations made under the National Insurance Act, 1946 and the Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations, 1953 persons may be excluded from work and entitled to National Health sickness benefit if, in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health, such persons are contacts or carriers of disease and it is necessary to exclude them from work in order to prevent the spread of infection. These Regulations apply particularly to food handlers in foodshops, also cooks, and kitchen hands employed in cafes, canteens and restaurants. During the year one such certificate was issued. DIPHTHERIA The Borough has now been free from cases of diphtheria since 1946, and if parents will continue to take advantage of the immunisation services offered, there is no reason why the disease should not remain entirely stamped out. The responsibility for providing this service rests with the County Council by virtue of section 26 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the Medical Officer of Health, who is also the Divisional Medical Officer for the County Council, organises the service within the Borough. Administrative work on immunisation is conducted in the Public Health Department on behalf of the County Council for which 35% of a clerk's salary is reimbursed. Arrangements also exist with general medical practitioners to carry out diphtheria, whooping cough and other immunisation. A doctor taking part is expected to send records to the Authority of the immunisation carried out in the course of his practice; the Authority provides the record cards and pays a fee to the doctor for each completed card received. Doctors are able to collect prophylactic material from the Public Health Department or from Grange Road Health Centre, Kingston-upon-Thames. Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics are held at:- Gosbury Hill Clinic, Monday mornings at 1, Gosbury Hill, 9.30 to 11 o'clock. Chessington. Telephones Lower Hook 5737. South Place Clinic, Monday mornings at Ewell Road, Surbiton. 11 o'clock. Telephone: Elmbridge 4897. (or Diphtheria Immunisation may be carried out by patient's own doctor, as described above). 13. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The number of immunisations carried out during the year was as follows:- Age Group Primary Immunisations during 1962. Reinforcement doses during 1962. Age under 1 year 347 _ Age 1 year to 4 years. 433 232 Age 5 years to 14 years. 13 686 The following table sets out the number of children immunised in each of the last seven years:- Year Primary Immunisations Reinforcements. 1956 741 298 1957 691 1,399 1958 799 1,162 1959 859 1,267 1960 956 1,002 1961 1,064 2,280 1962 793 918 14. SMALLPOX. Whilst this disease only appears in this country at rare intervals it is still prevalent in many parts of the world and its introduction here is an ever-present threat which materialised at the beginning of 1962 when outbreaks occurred in various parts of the country. This caused a flood of requests for vaccination against smallpox which necessitated immediate action being taken to deal with priorities, viz:- 1. Contacts of cases or suspected cases. 2. Primary infant vaccination. 3. Persons who had not been vaccinated within the last year travelling to and from known areas where Smallpox cases had been confirmed. 4. Staff of Public Health and other services likely to be in close contact with recent immigrants from infected areas. Special vaccination clinics for such priority cases, except infants, were arranged. Calls on general medical practitioners also became very heavy especially by persons wishing to travel abroad necessitating an International Certificate of Vaccination required to be completed by the doctor and authenticated by the local authority. There is very close liaison between local authorities and the sea and air ports, and contacts of this disease are kept under strict observation wherever they may be during the maximum incubation period of 16 days. The number of persons who were vaccinated or re-vaccinated during 1962 was:- Age Groups Under 1 1 2-4 5-14 15 or over TOTAL Vaccinations 703 71 83 441 329 1,627 Re-vaccinations - - 36 392 730 1,158 Calculations show that by the end of 1962 72% of children under one year had been vaccinated against smallpox. sonne dysentery. Twelve cases occurred during the year. The following table shows the number of cases occurring since first recognition of this disease in Surbiton in 1951s- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 62 - 10 12 25 289 202 28 123 2 - 12 POLIOMYELITIS.

At the end of the year good progress had been made towards the protection by vaccination of the priority groups for which vaccine had been issued by the Ministry of Health. These groups were:- All persons who have not at the time of their application for vaccination reached the age of forty. General Medical Practitioners. Ambulance staff. Hospital staff who come into contact with patients. Medical students. Practising dental surgeons, dental students, dental hygienists, student-hygienists and dental surgeons' chairside assistants. Practising nurses not working in hospitals. Public Health staff who may come into contact with poliomyelitis cases. The families of the above groups. Expectant mothers who are particularly urged to be vaccinated as early as possible in pregnancy and such requests are dealt with as priorities. Persons going to visit or reside in a country outside Europe, other than Canada or the United States of America. Vaccination with Sabin oral vaccine was started in April 1962, and has been increasingly used during the year. The vaccine given by mouth, not only provides protection but also prevents protected persons from louring natural dangerous poliomyelitis virus and spreading disease to unprotected persons. This type of vaccine would be of great value during an epidemic because it works quickly. 16. In June 1961 the Public Health Laboratory Service commenced a national one-year study of the incidence of poliomyelitis and other viruses in the faeces of normal children below 5 years of age with the object of obtaining more information as to the presence of these infections and to see what changes have taken place as a result of the widespread use of polio vaccine. We co-operated in this survey by arranging for and collecting five specimens per week during the period June 1961 to June 1962, from a total of 280 children. The promised report on the study is awaited. FOOD POISONING. There were only four confirmed cases notified by general medical practitioners; the causative organisms were identified as shown below:- S. Typhi-murium 4 cases. The ages of the four persons were as follows:- 2 years 1 3 years 1 5½ years 1 60 years 1 There was no connection between the cases and no source of origin of infection could be traced in any of them. No outbreaks of food poisoning in the town were notified in 1962. LABORATORY FACILITIES. Extensive use is made of the facilities provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health); and opportunity is taken gratefully to acknowledge the co-operation of Dr. D.R. Gamble and his staff at the Epsom Laboratory to which our specimens are taken. Apart from routine samples of water, milk, ice-cream and other food (details of which are given under other headings) the undermentioned specimens were collected by the inspectors in the course of investigating suspected cases of dysentery, para-typhoid, food poisoning, etc., and taken to the Laboratory.

PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936 (Section 172) No action was taken under this section. 19. MASS radiography The Mass X-ray Unit visited the Borough during the year, as detailed below:- Tolworth (Broadway, by Sainsbury's). on 20th, 22nd, and 23rd November, 1962. Chessington (near "Blackamoor's on 26th and 27th Head P.H."): November, 1962. Hook (by Community Centre): on 29th and 30th November, 1962. Surbiton (Winthrop House, on 4th, 6th and 7th St. Mark's Hill (opposite December, 1962. "Ritz" Cinema): and the provisional number of persons attending for Mass Radiography examination was as follows:- Chessington 541 Hook 811 Tolworth 1,217 Surbiton 654 The Unit's visit to Surbiton coincided with the very foggy period which was probably responsible for the rather low attendance. A provisional total number of persons attending for Mass Radiography examination during the Unit's visits to factories, etc. in the Borough during the months of October and December was as follows:- Chessington and 1,710 Surbiton. Chessington - 90 At the time of writing this report the medical findings have not yet been received. KINGSTON & DISTRICT TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE This is a local voluntary Committee which raises funds and gives help to families with tuberculosis and other chest diseases. It works with the Surrey County Council Official services and is formed from representatives of the four District Councils in the North Central Division together with other interested persons. The Town Council appoints two representatives annually and the representatives during 1962-3 were as follows:- Alderman Mrs. A. Woodgate, J.P. Mr. J.R. Ashton During the year 1962 an amount of £2,670 was spent on giving help to 106 families in the Division: 30 of these were Surbiton residents. 20. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. During the year seventy-three medical examinations were carried out at the Public Health Department, 2, Shalston Villas. These included the examination of new entrants to the Council's service, also members of staff attaining the age of 18 years to determine their suitability for acceptance under the Superannuation Scheme, members of the Borough Engineer's outdoor staff after completing six months' service to determine their suitability for entry into the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, also to examine special cases referred for investigation. The latter usually necessitated a considerable amount of correspondence with private doctors and hospital specialists. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE. There is in the Borough much voluntary work devoted to this cause such as provision of weekly clubs, daily centre, arranging seaside holidays, distribution of Christmas gifts and visiting of house-bound. The work is co-ordinated through the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee, a voluntary body representative of most walks of life and presided over by The Worshipful the Mayor. The Town Council leases to the Committee a large house known as "Alfriston", Berrylands Road, which, after extensive works of repair and re-decoration, was opened in September 1958 as a Centre for old people, including clubrooms, recreation rooms, handicraft room, chiropody clinic and canteen. The chiropody service is now being conducted on behalf of the County Council. A meals on wheels service is operated by the Surbiton Division of the British Red Cross Society, and the Council makes a generous contribution towards the cost involved. The number of subsidised mid-day meals distributed during the year was approximately 4,209. The Borough Council has provided one hundred and six special flats for aged people. There can be no exaggeration of the importance of this work for the old people, or of its increasing urgency as year succeeds year and more survive to the older age groups. The decision of the Council to increase its grant to the Old People's Welfare Committee to £1,500 for the year 1962/63 is a gesture which should enable that Committee to extend its work for the elderly in ways which it has hitherto been unable to do owing to lack of finances. CO-ORDINATION OF HEaLTH aND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES. In 1957 a committee of the Council was formed to consider and report upon methods of co-operation between the Town Council and other bodies concerned with the health and other social services within the Borough, to assist if required in the co-ordination of such work, and to examine ways of encouraging recruitment of more voluntary workers. The need for such work was indicated by the consideration of the Housing Committee of the previously published report of the Working Party of the Surrey County Council on the Prevention of Break-up of Families. There was also a conference between the Housing Committee, the Old People's Welfare Committee and the W.V.S. at which all aspects of the provision of services for the elderly was discussed. 21. NURSING IN THE HOME. (District Nursing). The Headquarters of the District Nursing Association is at 21-23, Upper Brighton Road (Telephone Number Elmbridge 3027) where application should be made for the services of a district nurse or midwife. Such applications have to be supported by the family doctor under whose direction all home nursing is given. The District Nursing Services are administered by the Surrey County Council through the Divisional Medical Officer of Health who is also Medical Officer of Health for Surbiton. There is at the District Nursing Headquarters in Upper Brighton Road a very valuable and successful training school for District Nurses and Midwives. ANTE-NATAL CLINICS. The ante-natal clinic can serve as the focal point to all activities relating to the expectant and nursing mother. The health visitor from the ante-natal clinic follows up cases at home for the purpose of advising and helping the expectant mother in all matters relating to pregnancy. Mothers are also encouraged to attend these clinics after their confinement to make sure that full health and normality is restored. This service is additional and designed to supplement that which an expectant mother is entitled to receive from a general practitioner and midwife. HOME HELP SERVICE. Persons desiring to avail themselves of this service should apply, supporting their application with a medical certificate, to the Divisional Medical Officer, The Health Centre, Grange Road, Kingston-upon-Thames, who will arrange for the Divisional Home Help Supervisor to visit and investigate the application. WATER SUPPLY. The whole of the water supply for the Borough comes from the Metropolitan Water Board and is satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. All premises have a direct mains supply and there are no wells or standpipes in use. Monthly reports are supplied by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. This dependable first class water supply is a tremendous factor in maintaining the good health of the people of Surbiton. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The Hogsmill River is the Borough boundary for some two miles on the eastern side. Now that sewage effluent from Epsom is no longer discharged into it, it has become a clean stream again and small fish which had been absent for many years have re-appeared. 22. The River Thames is the northern boundary and whilst there is no bathing a pleasant riverside promenade gives much pleasure to many people and boating and yachting are popular pastimes. The island known as Ravens Ait belongs to the Navy League and Sea Cadet Corps and is used as a national boat training station for sea cadets. SWIMMING BATHS. Publicly owned bath. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. There is also a paddling pool for small children. The water is from Metropolitan Water Board mains and is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition twentytwo samples were taken by the Public Health Department for chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. School bath. One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine with changes of water as necessary. Eight samples were taken by the Public Health Department to ensure adequate chlorination and fitness for bathing, all of which proved to be satisfactory. REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. Refuse and salvage collection is under the control of the Borough Engineer. The collection was maintained at seven day intervals except when interfered with by holidays and sickness. The refuse is transported to a central loading depot in the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames, transferred to large haulage wagons and then moved under contract for disposal into privately owned pits. SEWERAGE. There are very few cesspools remaining, nearly all properties in the Borough being connected to the public sewerage system. A new relief sewer has been constructed by the Council along the Hook Road to augment the existing sewer which had become inadequate. Sundry remedial works have been carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department to deal with flooding during times of heavy rainfall, and a new surface water sewer in the Tolworth area is under consideration. 23.

IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. The Council continued to operate this scheme in cases la) where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building, and (b) where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. These grants are now known as "Discretionary Grants" and are paid solely at the discretion of the local authority. During the year no such applications were received. 28. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS (Cont.) In addition, the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, requires local authorities to make grants towards the cost of providing "standard amenities" in dwellings; and makes certain amendments to the existing provisions relating to improvement grants. Further amendments to the scheme were; introduced by the 1961 Housing Act. The standard amenities now are:- (a) a fixed hath or shower in a bathroom; lb) a washhand basin; (c) a hot water supply at a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom, and at a washhand basin, and at a sink. (d) a water closet in, and accessible from within, the dwelling; (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. The amount of the "standard grant" which, subject to certain conditions, can be claimed as of right is one half of the cost of the approved works, subject to a maximum of £155. The limit of £155. is reduced as follows in respect of amenities which already exist:- Amonity: Reduction; £ Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom 25 Washhand basin 5 Hot water supply to bath, basin and sink 75 Water closet 40 Satisfactory food store 10 Twenty-four applications for standard grant were received, 22 were approved and 2 not proceeded with.

He believed that this could be achieved if authorities would make a determined and sustained effort to bring it about. 30. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS (Cont). The Circular suggested ways in which local authorities could induce owners to improve their properties and overcome the resistances that were bound to he offered by certain owners and tenants. Bearing in mind the steady progress already being made and having regard to the comparatively small number of rented properties remaining in the Borough the Council decided to ask the Town Clerk to arrange for further publicity to be given to the subject and to reconsider the matter at a later date. RENT ACT, 1957. This Act, together with its accompanying Regulations has been in operation since 6th July, 1957. The Council has delegated to the Public Health Committee its powers relating to Certificates of Disrepair, and this materially helps in dealing with applications in an expeditious manner which is so important in common fairness to the parties concerned. The position up to the end of the year is shown in the following summary:- 6th July to 31 st Dec.1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 (1)No.of applications for Certificates of Disreuair(Form I) 61 56 25 5 9 5 (2) No. of decisions not to issue Certificates 3 1 1 Nil 1 Nil (3) No. of decisions not to issue Certificates- (a) in respect of some but not all defects listed by tenants 40 36 16 5 4 2 (b) in respect of all defects listed 12 13 8 Nil 3 3 (4)No. of undertakings to remedy defects given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule (Form K). 27 34 19 4 4 6+ (5) No. of such undertakings refused by Council - - - - - - (6) No. of notices of proposal to issue a Certificate of Disrepair served (Form J) 52 57 25 5 7 5 (7)No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 10 32 5 1 - 2ø (8) No. of applications by tenants under consideration at the end of the year (Form I) 6 1 - - 1 - (9) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of Certificates (Form M) - 16 9 3 2 - (10) Objections by tenants to cancellation of Certificates - 9 1 3 - - (11) Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objections - 2 - - - - (12) Certificates cancelled by Local Authority - 13 9 2 2 - (13) Refusals to cancel Certificates Disrepair - 2 - 1 1 - (14) Certificates as to remedying of defects specified in landlord's undertaking (Form P) - 19 19 7 6 8 † includes 2 Undertakings accepted 17.1.62 although applications were received on 7.12.61. ø includes 1 Certificate which is in respect of application received on 17.11.61. 31. I RENT ACT, 1957 (Cont.) Dealing with applications by tenants and landlords has brought its problems, but despite the complications involved, it can be said that there have been no serious troubles and, so far, no appeals in which the Council has been concerned. There can be no doubt that a great deal of repair and redecoration of houses has taken place as a result of the Act much of it without recourse to the Council. The drop in the number of applications is very significant. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION. The Minister of Housing and Local Government made regulations under Part II of the Housing Act, 1961, which came into operation on 22nd May, 1962, to deal with squalid living conditions in houses in multiple occupation. Until 1954 bye-laws existed which could be applied to such premises, but these were then repealed and replaced by a general power which proved to be an unsatisfactory substitute. The new provisions are far-reaching and should considerably strengthen the hands of local authorities in dealing with properties of this type for which, despite lack of essential amenities, there seems to be an ever-increasing demand by people whose circumstances compel them to seek accommodation in rooms in houses let to a number of individuals or families. There has already been criticism of the short-comings of the new legislation, but our necessarily limited experience in administering it suggests that it will prove of great value in a district such as ours. COMMON LODGING-HOUSES A Common Lodging-House is defined as "a house (other than a public assistance institution) provided for the purpose of accommodating by night poor persons, not being members of the same family, who resort thereto and are allowed to occupy one common room for the purpose of sleeping or eating, and includes, where part only of a house is so used, the part so used". There are no such premises in this Borough. UNDERGROUND ROOMS. After much careful thought and correspondence with the Ministry the Council decided to adopt the amended version of the new model regulations recommended by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. They became operative on 3rd January 1963, on which date the previous regulations were repealed. NEW BUILDING REGULATIONS. By section 4 of the Public Health Act, 1961, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government is empowered to make building regulations which would in due course supersede existing local building byelaws. The Council decided to draw the attention of the Minister to the problems arising in connection with modern dwelling units which had no solid fuel burning fireplaces or boilers and consequently no means for the burning of materials requiring such disposal, and suggested the incorporation of a suitable Provision in the new regulations requiring the installation of small domestic incinerators in such premises. 32. NEW BUILDING REGULATIONS, (Cont.) Correspondence took place with the Ministry and the Member of Parliament, hut the Ministry regretted that they could not accept the suggestion because of certain practical objections. The Council approved the following resolution of the Public Health Committee:- "That this Committee remain convinced that the absence of a means of burning surgical materials in domestic dwellings presents a growing problem on public health grounds and the Association of Municipal Corporations be asked to take up with the Ministry the necessity for legislation to require the provision of domestic incinerators in dwellings which have no fireplaces or boilers burning solid fuel." FOOD INSPECTION. Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a variety of foods which were not fit were surrendered by the owners and destroyed by burning or burying. The total weight of such goods was:- cwts. qrs. lbs. ozs. 8 - 21 8½ There is no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough, consequently the only meat inspection carried out is in butchers' shops, canteens, etc. 18 samples of various kinds of food were taken for bacteriological examination as a routine measure to check on fitness for human consumption. FOOD HYGIENE. 44 premises are registered under section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved foods intended for sale, and 22 premises for the preparation of preserved food intended for sale for human consumption (including the preparation of fish by any process of cooking and the cooking of poultry). 1,123 visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public houses, food-handling businesses, and vehicles, to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements 33.

Consisted of chicken breasts in jelly. Contained about 85 per cent of solid cooked chicken meat. In the opinion of the Public Analyst a more appropriate description would be "Chicken Breasts in Jelly". Matter taken up with importers with a view to adjustment of description on label. 2542 (informal) Casserole Steak Consisted of canned beef and gravy of low quality. The expression 'casserole' used adjectivally is not one which can be applied to an article of this nature. No further action pending report of Pood Standards Committee dealing with standards for canned meats. 2563 (informal) Sild in Oil. Contained 0.7 per cent of added salt which was not specified on the label as an ingredient. The matter was taken up with the importers who submitted specimen of new labels which all future consignments will bear and which will be in order. 2574 ( informal) Sardines in Pure Olive Oil. Contained 1.7 per cent of added salt which was not specified on the label as an ingredient. The importers gave an assurance that they would overprint the labels on present stocks, and that future consignments would bear correct wording. 37. FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.) 2579 (informal) Mushrooms, Button Contained 1.3 per cent of added salt which was not specified on the label as an ingredient. The matter was taken up by the importers with the packers in France with a view to correcting the wording on the label. 2638 (informal) Pate de Foie. The ingredients of this article as specified on the label included liver and fat, but these are generic and not specific names or descriptions and do not constitute appropriate designations for the purpose of the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. The importers undertook to arrange with their suppliers for the wording on the label to be amended to which the Council agreed whilst indicating that they felt more care should have been taken when the wording was originally drafted. 2653 (informal) Pate de Foie Truffe. This article was made with pork and pork liver as the meat ingredients, but in the opinion of the Public Analyst pate de foie should be prepared with liver as the main ingredient and, although a little pork fat might be regarded as permissible, it should not contain pork. The packers explained that the matter had been raised in another district and having taken it up with their manufacturers arrangements had been made for future productions to contain a new recipe. Details of the proposed new label were submitted and the Public Analyst confirmed that the proposals would be quite satisfactory. FOOD & DRUGS ACT. 1955. Foreign bodies in food. String in Loaf. A resident purchased a small unwrapped bloomer loaf which was later found to contain a piece of string. The action taken by the department, together with correspondence with the manufacturers of the loaf was considered by the Council who decided that a warning letter be sent to the manufacturers. Insect on outside of loaf. - A local resident purchased a large white sliced and wrapped loaf which was later found to contain a large insect embedded in the bottom crust. After considering the circumstances and correspondence with the manufacturers the Council decided to send them a warning letter. 38. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 (Cont). Foreign "bodies in food (cont). Mould on Loaf of Bread - A local resident brought to the Department a small wrapped white medium sliced loaf of "bread she had purchased at a shop in the Borough the previous day. Upon opening the bread she had discovered on the top crust a patch of mould growth and further examination revealed mould patches on other slices. After considering the circumstances and correspondence with the manufacturers and retailer, the Council decided that a warning letter be sent to both the retailer and the manufacturer. Mould on Sausages. - A local resident brought to the Department some cellophane wrapped skinless beef sausages which she had purchased the previous day from a local shop. She alleged that upon opening the packet the same evening she had noticed a mould growth on one of the sausages. The action taken by the Department together with correspondence with the retailers concerned was considered by the Council who decided that a warning letter be sent to the retailers. MILK SUPPLY. 1. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations,1960. At the end of the year there were 71 Dealers'(Pre-Packed Milk) licences in force, as shown below:- Pasteurised 32 Sterilised 16 Tuberculin Tested 23 2. Registrations. At the end of the year there were forty-five entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of milk (Premises in the Borough ) 33 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 3 3. Milk Sampling. Ninety-eight samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following T. B.Biological Test Turbidity Test Phosphatase Test Methylene Blue Test Tuberculin Tested – – – 2 Tuberculin Tested (Raw Milk) 13 – – 19 T.T. Pasteurised – – 14 14 Pasteurised (C.L) – – – 1 Pasteurised – – 45 45 Sterilised – 4 – - 39. MILK SUPPLY (Cont.) 3. Milk Sampling - (Cont) All samples conformed to the required standard, except one sample of tuberculin tested milk from a vending machine which had failed the methylene blue test. This failure was taken up with the producer concerned and check samples taken. The explanation was an error in servicing the machine by a relief worker during the holiday period. The Council decided that a warning letter be sent to the producer concerned. The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. test ia for the purpose of detecting tubercle bacilli. 12 of the T.B.(Raw Milk; samples for T.B. test were taken at farms in the Borough. ICE CREAM. (i) Registration: 170 premises are registered by the Council under Section 16, Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, as under For manufacture, storage and sale 4 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to iced lollies 5 For storage and sale but not manufacture 160 For storage only 1 (ii) Samples: 97 samples were taken, details being as follows:- Ice Cream Grade 1 94 96.91% Grade 2 1 1.03% Grade 3 2 2.06% 100% Grade 4 Nil 97 Iced lollies Nil The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results on any single sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that over a six monthly Period, 50% of a vendor's samples should fall into grade 1,80% into grades 1 or 2, not more than 20% into grade 3 and none into grade 4. The results above show that a very high standard of hygienic quality is being maintained both by manufacturers and retailers. There is now no ice cream manufactured within the Borough. 40. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS. The parts of these Acts for which the Council is responsible relate to false trade descriptions of articles of food and to the marking of certain imported foodstuffs with an indication of the country of origin. There is a tendency for the requirements of these Acts and the Marking Orders made thereunder to be 'overlooked' necessitating reminders to traders of their obligation. 3 contraventions were observed during the year and a caution given in each case. There were no prosecutions. MOVABLE DWELLINGS. The following sites remain licenced either under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, or the Public Health Act, 1936, Section 269. 1. The Riverhill Estate the lease of which is held by a local Sports Club and where 36 caravans are permitted. 2. One caravan in the orchard of a private house. 3. A temporary summer-house type of dwelling on a large plot of land used only occasionally. As in the previous year a great deal of trouble was caused by itinerant caravan dwellers who placed their vehicles on sundry open sites in the Borough and were reluctant to move on. All the offenders were eventually removed after much difficulty. There are now seven Orders 'under the Surrey County Council Act in force in the Borough prohibiting the parking of moveable dwellings. DISINFECTION. (a) (i) During the year disinfection was carried out free of charge at four premises as under :- Chicken-pox 1 Tuberculosis 2 Suspected skin disease 1 (ii) Disinfection of bedding and premises was also carried out where non-infectious illnesses had occurred on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. There were fifteen such cases dealt with during the year. 41. DISINFECTION (Cont.) (b) The total number of articles disinfected by steam at Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was :- Disinfected: Destroyed: Blankets 12 2 cwts. of various types of bedding destroyed. Mattresses 5 Mattress covers 20 Pillows 35 Pillow cases 4 Sheets 4 Wearing apparel 17 Counterpanes 3 Bolsters 5 105 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 18 No. of library "books disinfected 28 DISINFESTATION. (a) Bed bugs, etc. Council Houses: Other Houses: Found to be infested Disinfested Found to be infested Disinfested Bugs - - 3 3 Cockroaches - - 1 1 (b) School Canteens. Early in the year the Surrey County Council decided to discontinue the arrangement whereby the Public Health Department carried out the annual spraying with insecticide of the school canteens, for which work the County Council paid the cost. Instead Caterers and Cooks-in-Charge were issued with sprayers and insecticide to spray the canteens themselves as and when required, and arrangements were made for them to receive suitable instruction in the use of sprayers and insecticide. (c) Wasps nests. The Council has no responsibility for the destruction of wasp nests on private property, but many calls for assistance are received (28 this year). All complainants are visited and suitable advice given; in most cases the nests are easily disposed of by the occupier using a recommended insecticide at sundown when it can be applied with no danger to the operator. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year 89 bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. 42. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT.1948. 1, It was not necessary to make any "burial arrangements as provided by section 50 of the Act. 2. It was not necessary to make use of the powers of section 47 for compulsory removal to suitable premises of sick and aged persons in need of care and attention. THE PET ANIMALS ACT.1951. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Five premises were licensed during the year. 18 inspections were made but no infringements of the licence conditions found. SHOPS ACT, 1950. One hundred and thirty-seven visits were made in the administration of this Act and four infringements corrected. "Shop" for the purpose of this Act is a very comprehensive term and includes any premises where any retail trade or business is carried on. The number of such premises in the Borough at the end of 1962 was :- Antique dealers and second-hand furniture 7 Bakers 20 Boots and Shoes 30 Builders and Decorators Supplies 27 Butchers 34 Cafes and Restaurants 42 Chemists 22 Confectioners,Newsagents and Tobacconists 94 Cycles, Radio and Television 23 Dairies and Milkshops 6 Drapers and Ladies' Outfitters 54 Electrical Supplies 20 Fishmongers and Fried Fish Shops 15 General Stores 14 Greengrocers,Fruiterers & Florists 57 Grocers and Provision Merchants 75 Hairdressers 47 Hardware, Ironmongery and Timber 20 Licensed premises 50 Motor and Cycle dealers and Engineers 33 Tailors and Outfitters 14 Upholsterers and House Furnishers 13 Watchmakers and Jewellers 8 Miscellaneous 105 830 The present unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to shops is to be deplored. The 1950 Act is merely a consolidation of legislation parsed between 1912 and 1938 and is to a large degree outmoded. Further, there have been many decisions given by the Courts which have rendered much of the Act virtually incomprehensible and consequently inoperable. It seems most desirable for the sake of traders, public and local authorities, as well as for Inspectors trying to carry out their duties in a state of uncertainty, that amending legislation will not be much longer delayed. 43. NOISE ABATEMENT. The Noise Abatement Act, 1960, came into operation on 27th November, 1960, the main provisions being as follows:- (i) Noise or vibration. Under section 1, a noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with under Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. Under this procedure, local authorities will be able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of premises on which it arises, and if the notice is not complied with it can be enforced by proceedings in a magistrates court. Apart from action by a local authority, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make a complaint to a magistrate. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration caused by aircraft, which are subject to other statutory controls, nor to noise or vibration caused by statutory undertakers in the exercise of their powers. In the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business it is a defence in any proceedings to show that the best practical means have been used for preventing it and counteracting its effect; (ii) Loudspeakers in streets. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. except in the following circumstances (a) For Police, Fire Brigade or Ambulance purposes, or by a local authority within their area; (b) For communicating with persons on vessel for the purpose of directing the movement of that or any other vessel; (c) If the loudspeaker forms part of a public telephone system; (d) If the loudspeaker (1) Is in or fixed to a vehicle; and (2) is operated solely for the entertainment of or for communieating with the driver or a passenger of the vehicle or,where the loudspeaker is or forms part of the horn or similar warning instrument of the vehicle, solely for giving warning to other traffic; and (3) is so operated as not to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity; (e) Otherwise than on a highway, by persons employed in connection with a transport undertaking used by the Public in a case where the loudspeaker is operated solely for making announcements to passengers or prospective passengers or to other persons so employed; 44. NOISE ABATEMENT. (Cont.) (ii) Loudspeakers in streets (cont) (f) By a travelling showman on land which is being used for the purpose of a pleasure fair; (g) In case of emergency. No trade, business or entertainment may be advertised by loudspeakers at any time, except that between noon and 7 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are on sale; the loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. (iii) Byelaws. Section 4 preserves existing byelaws and byelaw making powers. The Public soon became interested in this Act and complaints continued to be received during the year, some of which were rather trivial. All the complaints were investigated, and by persuasive means a number of items received attention which brought relief if not complete satisfaction to those aggrieved. This is a new field of activity for the Public Health Inspectors as hitherto no such powers have been in the hands of Councils except those with local Act provisions. The subject has therefore had to be approached with caution, but the response of those who found they were causing annoyance (even though insufficient evidence had been obtained to prove actual nuisance) has been quite co-operative. It seems likely therefore that tactful handling of the situation will in most cases produce the desired results without recourse to statutory action, which is just as well, for the prescribed procedure appears to present many difficulties for those charged with the administration of the Act if the need for prosecutions should arise. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956. The Council gave further consideration to the establishment of smoke control areas including the statement prepared by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in answer to representations which had been made to him suggesting amendments to the provisions of the Act relating to such areas. In spite of these representations, the Ministry had reached the conclusion that it would not be possible to consider amending the provisions of the Act in any of the ways suggested, and the Minister hoped that, as the need for the control of domestic smoke in the interest of public health had been established beyond any doubt, the Town Council 45. CLEAN AIR ACT. 1956. (cont.) would feel able to make a start with smoke control in their area, in common with the great majority of local authorities in Greater London. After very careful consideration the Council resolved - "That the Minister be informed that this Council (A) re-affirm that they are in full agreement with the desirability of reducing the emission of smoke from domestic chimneys. (B) are of opinion that residents are voluntarily changing to smokeless fuels at a satisfactory rate, it being unlikely that this rate -/ill be significantly increased by legislation. (In this respect, the Council further believe that emission of smoke in the Borough is not excessive at the present time) (c) intend to keep the matter under review and to reconsider it in not less than two years' time." The Council agreed to participate in the Ministry*s scheme for the measurement of air pollution, and a station for the measurement of smoke and sulphur dioxide was set up at 2, Shalston Villas under the direction of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Official recordings commenced on 3rd September,1962, and results will be published when a sufficient period has elapsed - probably a year - for a reasonable interpretation of recordings to be made. Membership of the London & Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council was continued, and the Chief Public Health Inspector served on the Executive Committee of that organi sation. The Council also appointed the Chairman ( or in his absence the Vice- Chairman) of the Public Health Committee and the Chief Public Health Inspector as its representatives on the Standing Conference of Co-operating Bodies on air pollution and research organised by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. FACTORIES ACT. 1961. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 296 (252 mechanical, 22 non-mechanical and 22 works of building construction). Four hundred and one visits were made to these premises and work was carried out to remedy contraventions as follows :- 46. FACTORIES ACT. 1961. (Cont.)

The Prevention of Damage "by Pests Act, 1949, places upon the occupiers or, in certain circumstances the owners, of land (including buildingss) the responsibility for the destruction of rats and mice thereon and for keeping the land free from such pests. It is the duty of the Council to carry out inspections to see that this is done, and to secure so far as practicable that their district is kept free from rats and mice. where necessary they may serve upon owners or occupiers notices requiring them to take steps for this purpose and penalties are laid down for failure to comply with such notices. The policy of the Council is, however, to give such assistance as is possible to the occupiers of private dwelling houses. For that purpose they permit their own small rodent control staff, who are primarily engaged to deal with Corporation property (including sewers) to give advice and practical help where appropriate, without charge subject to the signing of the "Request for Treatment" form. The Council is under no legal obligation to do this and does not -undertake to provide a service for the destruction of vermin, but allows its staff to help so far as time permits. Sixty-three schools, business and industrial premises were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year. 49. 50. VISITS. 1.
