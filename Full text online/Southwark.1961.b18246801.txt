Telephone: RODNEY 5464 To The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. YOUR WORSHIP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1961. Social Conditions The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark lies to the south of the River Thames the mid-stream of which forms its northern boundary. The Borough forms a boundary with Lambeth to the west, as far south as Kennington Park, to the south with Camberwell, and to the east with Bermondsey. The landward part of the Borough extends to 1,131 acres and is divided into ten Wards. The Elephant and Castle forms a landmark, roughly dividing the borough into two. The portion of the borough between the Elephant and the river is becoming increasingly devoted to wharves, warehouses, diverse industry including food factories, and the printing trade, and offices while the area south and south-east of the Elephant is mainly residential in character. The provision of office accommodation in the northern part of the Borough continues a trend of commercialisation which was commented upon sixty years ago by the Borough's first Medical Officer of Health in his first annual report. The momentum of development has however of late rapidly increased, not only in the north but also in the southern part of the borough where the improved aesthetic effects of the new and attractive housing estates which have been built both by this Council and the London County Council, with their associated open spaces become ever more apparent. The role of Southwark as a religious centre is symbolised by the two fine cathedrals which it contains. The historic and cultural aspects of the borough are well known and the commercial and industrial importance of this central London borough have continued to increase. The extensive redevelopment which is taking place at the Elephant and Castle, the Brandon Estate and elsewhere are already giving Southwark a new look. A large modern office block already houses the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Health will in due course occupy newly constructed offices at the Elephant and Castle. II Vital Statistics In Southwark, the natural increase in population, that is the excess of births, over deaths, is usually of the order of 400 each year and 1961 was no exception. During the last decade this natural increase has been offset by a much larger decrease due to emigration, the rate of which reached a peak some five or six years ago and now shows signs of diminishing. Even so, the Registrar General's estimate of the population as at mid-1961 showed a decrease of some two and a half thousand. The live births were just short of 1,700 giving a crude birth rate of 19.6 per thousand of the population. For the purposes of comparison this figure must be multiplied by a comparability factor giving a birth rate of 17. 8 which is the highest rate in Southwark since 1952 and slightly higher than that for England and Wales. An increase in the still birth rate was offset by a reduction in the infant death rate which was the lowest for five years. Of the 37 infant deaths, twenty occurred during the first four weeks of life giving a neo-natal mortality rate of 11.8 per 1,000 live births as compared with 15.5 the corresponding figure for England and Wales. Two maternal deaths occurred during the year, a maternal mortality rate of 1.1 per thousand live and still births. The crude death rate per thousand population was 14.4 but this figure after adjustment falls to 12, which is exactly similar to the death rate experienced by the country as a whole, and is the same as that in Southwark during 1960. Once more, the principal causes of death were diseases of the heart and circulatory system, followed by malignant diseases and diseases of the respiratory system. Nine persons died from pulmonary tuberculosis and sixty-eight from cancer of the lung. Infectious Disease The infectious disease record in Southwark during the year was, apart from measles, relatively good. Measles was epidemic in 1961, 1,671 cases being notified as compared with 322 during the previous year. The number of confirmed cases of dysentery was less than half that of 1960. Even this number of cases is too high and control measures made demands on both the Public Health Inspectors and the clerical staff. Although not all the cases notified occurred in private households, a further reduction in the incidence of this condition can be looked for as more adequate sanitary facilities are provided in homes, and in schools, and as more attention is paid to the washing of hands particularly after attendance at the toilet and before meals. III There were no cases of diphtheria during the year and only 40 of whooping cough. Three cases of poliomyelitis occurred, one being paralytic. Vaccination and immunisation is available against these three diseases as well as against tetanus and smallpox, and the incidence of these diseases will only remain at alow level as long as parents ensure that their children receive these injections, or as in the case of poliomyelitis, receive the vaccine by mouth. In regard to diphtheria and poliomyelitis it is particularly important that the immunity of children should be reinforced by a booster dose as recommended. A report presented recently to the Health Committee of the London County Council by Dr. J.A. Scott, the Medical Officer of Health of that authority shows that the incidence of Poliomyelitis in unvaccinated children under fourteen years of age was eighteen times that of the vaccinated. An employee in premises in which the business of a tanner of hides is conducted was admitted to hospital during the first quarter of the year suffering from anthrax. The employee who did not reside in Southwark made a good recovery. The Factory Inspectorate reported conditions at the premises to be satisfactory. Health Education Health Education becomes an ever more important function of the Public Health Department. As intimated in my report last year a fundamental field for health education is now presented by the necessity to persuade not only parents but the general public to take advantage of the facilities which are now provided by the National Health Service, and in particular of those services which have been referred to in the previous paragraph and which are provided by the local health authority. Immunology, with the introduction of new and more efficient agents has become a subject of specialised study. A programme of inoculations has been carefully drawn up so that the recipient gains the greatest possible immunity from them, and parents should be guided by the official advice on this subject which they receive from time to time. During the year, this Department collaborated with the London County Council in displaying posters and issuing leaflets thus supplementing the work carried out in homes and schools by the Health Visitors and School Nurses. A great deal of attention was given by the Public Health Inspectors to the subject of alimentary infections such as Dysentery, F ood Poisoning, non-specific gastro-enteritis and so on, and constant stress was laid on the importance of food hygiene, during their visits to catering establishments, as well as to private households. In these efforts advantage was taken of the media provided by the Central Council for Health Education and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. IV Welfare of the Elderly The eleventh annual report of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee prepared by the Organising Secretary, Miss Doris M. Beer, A.I.S.W., M.R.I.P.H.H. is a much more ambitious document than in former years, and with its illustrations gives an excellent picture of the work for old people which was carried on at St. Albans Hall during the year. Extracts from Miss Beer's report are reproduced at the end of this report and it will be seen that an average of no fewer than 9000 meals per month were served either in the restaurant or in the luncheon clubs, or delivered to the homes of old people as Meals on Wheels. During May, the workshop for the elderly was opened and since that time those taking part have benefited in happiness and rehabilitation; The chiropody clinic and the holidays by the sea are very important functions of the Old People's Welfare Committee. The year under review saw the inception of the special scheme financed by the Borough Council, for old people to have a holiday free of charge, apart from a token payment of one guinea. In addition to the very valuable work which is being done for those old people well enough to attend St. Albans Hall, it is pleasing to note that special attention is being given to the house-bound who, thanks to the provision of transport, have been taken to and from St. Albans Hall as well as on various outings. Old people who have deteriorated physically, and mentally, and who are not receiving for one reason or another the care and attention which they require, and which is their due, are constantly coming to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health through the general practitioners, relatives, the Public Health Inspectors, the Home Help Organiser, the District Nurses, the Old People's Welfare Association, as well as from other sources. The question of compulsory removal very frequently arises in regard to this group. While not hesitating to take action where this is absolutely necessary, the Medical Officer of Health endeavours to avoid compulsion if this is at all possible. If he does not initiate action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948 or under the National Assistance (Amendeat) Act,. 1951, then the Medical Officer of Health must ensure that the old person in question receives all the services and daily supervision which are necessary. Very often an old person who does not wish to go into hospital or an old person's home also does not wish to take advantage of such domiciliary services as, for example, the Home Help Service, the District Nursing Service or the incontinent laundry service. To persuade the oid person to accept domiciliary services or to enter hospital or a home voluntarily may be time consuming. V It involves getting to know the old person really well and helping them in a practical way. The old people in this group are invalids or semi-invalids; most of them are women. Valuable visitation of old people in the Borough is at present undertaken by:- Miss Beer, and voluntary helpers. The Health Visitors (London County Council). The Domestic Help Organiser and her Assistant (L.C.C.). The District Nurses (District Nursing Association). The Public Health Inspectors. Even so it was felt that there was a need for the employment of a qualified health visitor responsible to the Medical Officer of Health for the visitation of this special group of old people. Miss Fitzpatrick was appointed to this post in September, and by the end of the year it was apparent that the appointment was filling a definate gap in the services provided in Southwark for old people. From tne outset it was intended that the work of the Woman Health Officer should not in any way cut across the very excellent work being done at or from St. Albans Hall and it is gratifying to be able to report that there has been the closest co-operation between all the services concerned. During the year the incontinent laundry service continued its extremely important task in making it possible for certain elderly patients to be nursed in their own homes. This service is under the supervision of Mr. T. Lloyd, the Superintendent of the Treatment and Bathing Centre, whose staff also provide the home hathing service for certain of the old people who, although not requiring the services of the District Nurse, are still in need of this type of assistance, Whereas in 1960 it was necessary to arrange for the compulsory removal to institutions of no fewer than four old people, during 1961 such action was necessary in only one case. The old gentleman concerned settled down very well in an Old People's home where he remained voluntarily. Housing. The work undertaken in regard to slum clearance is set out in the body of this report. The Public Health Inspectors were also active in relation to sanitary defects and a substantial amount of the remedial works involved were undertaken directly by the Council in default of the owners. The older properties in the Borough call for unremitting attention in regard to such matters as the cleanliness of common staircases and yards, the maintenance of dust chutes, gullies, and overflow pipes. Quite apart from amenity, neglect can quickly give rise to conditions which are a danger to health, VI The health of many families in Southwark would benefit by inproved, and in some cases, larger housing accommodation. Detailed consideration was given to cases referred on health grounds as well as to families who were found to be overcrowded. Clean Air. It will be apparent from Mr. Stubbs' report that a great deal of work was undertaken during the year both by Mr. Stubbs and the Public Health Inspectors in regard to clean air. By the end of the year the first smokeless zone had been established and was functioning and a survey had been completed of a second area. The year 1974 was adopted as a target for making the entire Borough smokeless, The supply of smokeless fuel became difficult at Christmas and this aspect of clean air policy is receiving the attention of the Council. It is most gratifying that Mr. G. Stubbs, Smoke Abatement Officer, has been elected to the Executive Council of the National Society for Clean Air. Common Lodging Houses. In May 1961 when granting the applications for renewal of licences for the six common lodging houses in Southwark, the Public Health Committee expressed the view that the question of the permitted number of occupants should receive further consideration, and arising from this a special report was submitted, in which the present position in regard to Bye-Laws and so on was set out. Since that time there have been discussions at officer level with the London County Council and other metropolitan boroughs on permitted numbers, the definition of a 'common lodging house' and the provision of amenities and it would appear that the powers of local authorities in regard to lodging houses should be strengthened, and should cover a wider range of establishments of a similar nature. In Southwark there has been a slow but steady improvement In conditions in common lodging houses, but further improvement, if this type of accommodation is to continue to be used, is undoubtedly desirable. In several of the lodging houses in Southwark the character of the population has undergone considerable change so that the casual inmate tends to be in the minority. Many persons some of them working men, stay on in these lodging houses indefinitely. A substantial proportion are old age pensioners of independent mind who for some reason or another are reluctant to enter an old persons' home. Modern standards have risen in other fields and having regard to the change in the type of resident it is clear that common lodging house accommodation must also be upgraded. The alternative might be closure but the demand is there. VII The six registered lodging houses, two male and four female, in Southwark vary in size from a Salvation Army Hostel for men with 461 beds to a small women's lodging house with 21 beds. The female lodging houses are supervised by a female Public Health Inspector. During the year visits to all the lodging houses are also paid from time to time by the Chief Public Health Inspector as well as by your Medical Officer of Health. During the year just past the Keepers of two female and one male establishment were seen by the Chief Public Health Inspector and myself at this office and the importance of increased comfort and amenity was stressed. By agreement it has been possible to get some reduction in the number of beds at certain of the common lodging houses, to have a room set aside as a baggage room in one of the establishments, to have certain structural works carried out as well as redecoration and improvement of bedding and so on. The kitchen at the large common lodging house has been modernised. In particular, the Chief Officer of the London Fire Brigade arranged, at my request, for a member of his Fire Prevention staff to inspect each of the premises. The recommendations made were passed to the Keepers and many have been implemented, including the provision of fire alarm systems. I am most grateful to the Chief Fire Officer and his staff for their co-operation in this matter. Within the framework of the existing Bye-Laws, which undoubtedly need revision, every effort was made thooughout the year to obtain improvement in conditions. Conclusion. I should like to thank the Chairmen and members of the various committees for their support and encouragement and for their interest in public health throughout the year. My thanks are also due to the Chief Officers for their co-operation and help at all times. The Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. H. Archer, Mr. E. A. Clark, Senior Clerk, and the entire staff of the Public Health Department have given of their best and have earned my sincere gratitude. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, A.D.C.S. CAMERON Medical Officer of Health VIII PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at 31st December, 1961) Mayor - Mrs. A.

Lloyd, T. D. ) The incontinent laundry service, commenced in 1957, has now built up to become one of the main occupations of the Centre. A total weight of 45,741 lbs. of incontinent items of bedding and clothing from the Southwark and Lambeth areas, was laundered during the past year. The demand for this service has increased to such extent that the limit with which the present machinery can cope has, on some days each week, now been reached. The laundry from the Southwark area is collected from the homes by our own transport and delivered on the next day, ready for immediate use This service has now become a major amenity to mainly old people living alone, or with an ageing partner, who have had incontinence added to their worries of failing health. In regard to individuals requiring treatment for scabies, or for a verminous condition, the numbers have again decreased except in the case of adult male persons. There was, in fact, a quite considerable increase in the numbers of adult males dealt with during the year. Of the 657 treatments of these individuals for active or suspected body vermin infestations, 411, gave the addresses of various lodging houses and hostels in this area as their place of residence. A total of 179 other men were listed as "casuals", i.e. they claimed that they had no fixed place of abode or were passing through the district, a number of male callers openly gave an address within other London Boroughs. These were referred to the Local Authorities of those areas, all of whom maintain their own centres for the cleansing of verminous persons. A considerable amount of domestic pest control work was carried out during the year. This work was mainly connected with infestations of bed bugs and fleas, but also included were infestations of various species of flies and beetles in adult and immature forms. Some public buildings had repeated and heavy infestations of flies and considerable efforts were necessary to reduce these nuisances. A number of business and trading concerns requested the Council's assistance in eradicating insect infestations within their premises The infestations dealt with included cockroaches, carpet beetles, fleas, biscuit beetles and wood lice. Because of staff difficulties, it has not been found possible to extend the Home Bathing service for aged persons; and new cases can only be taken on as vacancies occur. There are, however, still limited facilities available for housebound aged, but not ill, persons of both sexes, to be collected from their homes in the Council' s transport for an occasional bath at this Centre. -19- Infectious Disease Cases: Enquiries and Visits Total - 301 as under: Encephalitis 1 Gastro enteritis 1 Scarlet Fever 68 Poliomyelitis 3 Dysentery(bacilliary) 99 Smallpox contacts 2 Food Poisoning 31 Erysipelas 12 Meningococcal infections 6 Diphtheria 14 Revisits 64 Disinfection following infectious diseases Rooms treated (Formalin solution) 50 Library books treated 116 Other disinfection, Tuberculosis etc 2 Treatment of Verminous and Infected Articles (including precautionary disinfestation) Verminous articles treated Infected articles treated Beds 71 4 Palliasses 371 16 Bolsters 23 4 Pillows 510 100 Cushions 15 10 Blankets 993 169 Sheets 714 97 Quilts 495 34 Other articles (clothing, etc.) 9,482 520 Rehousing Precautionary disinfestation of soft goods and bedding (including 1 family rehoused by L.C.C.). 38 families -20- Scabies and Vermin Treatments Scabies Vermin Males Females Males Females Lambeth cases 15 45 10 65 treatments 21 62 10 68 Southwark cases 21 31 647 114 treatments 36 49 647 114 L.C.C.

Some of the Borough Council's sewers are very old and deteriorating and the Council has a scheme for their reconstruction. WATER SUPPLY The domestic water supply of the Borough is supplied by t he Metropolitan Water Board, and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. During the year, 2 complaints were received. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and the samples analysed, and found satisfactory. Whilst the Board from time to time draws samples for bacteriological and chemical examination, samples of drinking water have been taken by the Public Health Inspectors and submitted to the Public Analyst who has reported in each case that the supply was satisfactory. In many of the old tenement buildings the water supply is communal, there being taps on the staircase landings whilst in others the water passes through storage tanks on the roofs. The indirect supply of water for drinking purposes has been considered in a number of cases to be unsatisfactory and representations have been made to the owners with a view to all taps being supplied direct from the rising main. -25- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 98 During the year 5 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board.

Frequency of Change 3½ hour turnover on each pool. Source of Supply Metropolitan Water Board. Twenty bath samples were analysed by the Public Analyst. It is standard practice to record the number of bathers who have used the bath prior to the sample being taken and the number of bathers in the pool at the time of sampling, and the appearance of the water. In 16 cases, the appearance was clear and as regards the other four, the baths were being used by an unusually large number of bathers, when the appearance was slightly cloudy. The analyses, however, revealed bacterial counts ranging from under 5 to 4000 per ml. and free chlorine 0.01 to 5 parts per mls.

Regular tests are made at approximately 8.0 a.m., 12.30 p.m. and 4.0 p.m. each day by the Baths Filtermen who control the temperature and cleanliness and spot checks are made from time to tine by the Baths Superintendent. -31- HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS In accordance with Section 18 of the L. C. C. (General Powers) Act, 1954, relating to hairdressers and barbers' establishments, four such premises were registered during the year. The total premises registered at the end of the year were 83. RENT ACT, 1957 The following table gives a summary of the action taken in regard to the issue of Certificates of Disrepair. Application 7 Decisions to issue certificates 6 Undertakings by landlords to carry out repairs 3 Certificates issued 3 Certificates refused - Applications withdrawn - Applications by landlords for cancellation of certificates 6 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates - Decision by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants objections - Certificates cancelled by Local Authority 3 RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 During the year 2 samples were taken and submitted to the prescribed Analyst, Mr. G. Ginger, F. C.S., Chiltern Research Laboratories, Ltd., High Wycombe, Bucks. These samples complied with the requirements of the Regulations. Five premises are registered for the use of filling materials and two licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. The Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Regulations 1961, operative from August 1st, superseded the 1951 and 1954 Regulations. In addition to defining used wood wool as a filling material to which the Rag Flock & Other Pilling Materials Act 1951 applies, they prescribe standards of cleanliness for filling materials; the form of certificate to be issued by analysts, and the form in which records are to be kept of occupiers of premises registered under the Act or licensed for the manufacture or storage of rag flock. -32- SCHOOLS - WASHING FACILITIES. All schools in the Borough have been re-inspected and details of inadequate facilities for sanitary conveniences and washing facilities have been sent to the Education Officer of the London County Council; as a result a considerable amount of work in this connection has been carried out at these schools during the past year. ANTHRAX The Anthrax Prevention (Goat Hair & Shaving Brushes) Order 1961 which came into operation in November, repeats with modifications earlier Orders now revoked, and prohibits the importation of certain types of goat hair, yarns and Japanese shaving brushes. NOISE With the coming into operation of the Noise Abatement Act 1960 a number of complaints were received. The problems arose from amongst other things, the loading and unloading of lorries during the night time, engineering and building work at night and concrete mixing machinery. So far, it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings and there have been considerable improvements,but at the end of the year one particularly serious nuisance was still being dealt with. -33- AIR POLLUTION (Smoke Abatement Officer - Mr. G. Stubbs) It is pleasing to record that the figures for smoke and sulphur dioxide, as recorded on the daily volumetric apparatus, show that the improvement of the previous year has been maintained. There was also an overall decrease in the amount of deposited matter in the Borough. The Smoke Control Order No. 1 made by Council on 11th January 1961 was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 27th April to come into operation on 1st November 1961, The area is mainly residential and is bounded by Walworth Road, Trafalgar Street, Dawes Street, Portland Street and Westmoreland Road, and covers 38 acres. The results of the survey showed that since the previous inspection of the area in 1957 there had been some major changes; a number of properties had been demolished, new buildings erected, and many families had ceased to burn solid fuel and were using electricity, gas or oil for heating. These factors reduced the number of fire-grates to be replaced, with a consequent reduction in the amount of estimated expenditure. Included in the area are 1,302 separate dwellings, 54 shops and public houses, one school, one clinic, one Church and Hall, and 12 factories. The figures of the survey indicated that the appliances in 640 dwellings needed replacement or adaptations with gas ignition, at an estimated total cost of £8,250. Seven-tenths of this amount would be paid by the Council (the Exchequer repaying four-tenths) and the remaining three-tenths would be paid by the owner or occupier. This would mean the Borough Council being responsible for £2,475, the Exchequer £3,300 and the owners or occupiers £2,475. No adaptations of appliances in bedrooms were considered except in special circumstances It was calculated that 1,100 additional tons of smokeless fuel would be required for the area. Following the confirmation of the Order the owners of the properties in the area were interviewed and they promised full co-operation. Discussions also took place with re presentatives of the London Electricity Board, South East Gas Board, Coal Utilisation Council, Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation and local fuel merchants. Both the Electricity and Gas Boards offered a scheme whereby the occupier or owner can pay than three-tenths of the approved cost of an adaptation and allow the Board to collect the grant direct from the Council. Such an arrangement would save the occupier or owner paying out the full amount and then waiting for the grant. Special displays of appliances suitable for conversion jobs were arranged at the Electricity and Gas show-rooms in Walworth Road. The mobile exhibition of the Solid smokeless Fuels Federation toured the "area at different times of the year so that householders could see practical demonstrations and be given advice on how to burn the fuels satisfactorily and economically. The Coal Utilisation Council printed a supply of pamphlets which were helpful to users of solid fuel. -34- The occupiers and owners of dwellings which required some modification or replacement were advised fully of the position and the owners were also sent the estimate forms. The occupiers of dwellings which did not require any modification were informed by letter of the date of the Order and that it would be an offence to emit smoke after that date and advising them to ensure that any stock of bituminous coal be used up before 31st October 1961 and replenished with an authorised fuel. Their co-operation was invited. Generally, it was found that the estimates submitted by the owners were usually reasonable, and in the cases where the builders' specifications and estimates were considered excessive, there were discussions and agreement before the forms of approval were sent to the applicants. The amounts in several of the estimates substantially exceeded our estimated costs and it was found that the differences were principally due to the proposed installation of superior appliances. It was pointed out to the owners and builders that these appliances could be installed but the extra cost would not rank for grant. All the required works of adaptation were not completed by 1st November, the delay was principally due to the large number of orders for gas ignition being handles by the Gas Board. It is pleasing to record that on visiting the dwellings where conversions had been completed the tenants expressed general approval of the scheme and satisfaction with the work carried out. It was decided that a detailed survey should be made of a, proposed area No. 2 for the purpose of a Smoke Control Order. This proposed area is bounded by Farmer's Road, St. Agnes Place, Kennington Park Place, Cook's Road, Fleming Road, St. Paul's Church, Lorrimore Square, rear of Carter Street (South side), Penrose Street, rear of Lorrimore Road (south side), Heiron Street, Hillingdon Street. The area includes most of the London County Council Brandon Estate and Borough Council property, and covers 40 acres. A detailed survey of the area has been completed and is now before the Council. Careful consideration was given to a programme of future smoke control orders, and it was decided that the year 1974 be adopted as the target for the completion of smoke control orders covering the whole Borough. Up to Christmas no complaints had been received of any difficulty in obtaining supplies of smokeless fuels but after that time, with the coming of severe weather, several complaints were received from householders of inability to obtain supplies of Cleanglow or Coalite. It appeared that Sebrite was available. On investigating the complaints at Walworth Road Coal Depot, the merchants confirmed there was a temporary shortage of the premium fuels. 3hey pointed out it was a time of peak demand and the severe weather had delayed delivery trucks. Fortunately, supplies to the Depot increased and the delivery time to the householders was considerably reduced. -35- Many dwellings have limited storage space, so that regular weekly deliveries are necessary, but are not always forthcoming. There is a preference in the smoke control areas for premium fuels, particularly Cleanglow and Coalite, and the demands occasionally exceed the supplies available. Ten notifications were received of proposals to install new furnaces, and plans and specifications in respect of three other installations were submitted and approval given. One other application for approval is the subject of negotiations with the firm. The Council has in use a daily volumetric smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus, two standard deposit gauges, and three lead peroxide instruments. The Central Electricity Generating Board has a lead peroxide instrument on the jetty of the Bankside Power Station. During the year 15 complaints were received regarding smoke emission, 210 special observations and inspections were made by the Inspector and 12 Intimation Notices were issued. In all cases the managements were co-operative and it was not necessary to institute legal proceedings. -36- Deposited matter at following sites:- 1961 Rainfall (inches) BANKSIDE WALWORTH ROAD Mean Daily Concentration of Sulphur Dioxide micro gms. per cubic metre.

Further control by local authorities of houses in multiple occupation. Re-conditioning of condemned houses. Greater rent increases in respect of improvements. Repairs to dwelling houses with short leases. Amendment as to town development. Exchequer subsidies for new housing accommodation will depend upon the financial needs of the local authorities and are no longer only in respect of housing of persons displaced from Slum Clearance. A local authority being satisfied that unfit houses and buildings, parts of which are dwellings, included in clearance areas have been or will be made fit for human habitation, may subsequently exclude the houses subject to the Minister's confirmation. In deciding the standard of repair for which the landlord is responsible, regard must be had to the age, character and prospective life of the dwelling and the locality in which it is situated. The Minister indicated in his Circular that further circulars would be issued relating to conditions in multi-occupied houses and the policy on improvement grants together with practice notes for the guidance of local authorities. The Minister's Regulations and the further circulars are anxiously awaited. Until they are available, little useful progress can be made regarding the houses in multiple occupation. -42- The Housing Act, 1961, makes big inroads into control by Local Authorities of standards in houses in multiple occupation. Failure to comply with Management Codes will be criminal offences with considerable penalties. Realistic liabilities are to be placed upon owners The new powers to Local Authorities are very wide and strong and consequently will be used with good sense and discretion. It seems that the new legislation is timely to deal strenuously with the bad landlord who seriously overcrowds his houses and neglects proper standards. The Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962, are awaited so that the black spots in this special class of housing may be dealt with effectively and with expedition. -43FOOD THE INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD During the year, 189,409 tons of imported food were inspected under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937 and 1948, and the Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulation, 1925 to 1953.

MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926 At the time of inspection of foodstuffs on importation, and in shops and on street stalls, attention has been given to the requirements relating to Indication of Origin. The products to which the Act applies, have been satisfactorily marked. These are as follows:- Fresh Apples Bacon and Ham Currants Poultry Sultanas Meat Raisins Margarine Eggs in shell Malt products Dried eggs Frozen or chilled Salmon and Sea Trout Oat products Butter Raw Tomatoes Honey -48ICE CREAM There are 296 ice-cream dealers and 10 manufacturers in this borough, an increase of 1 dealer since last year. Most of the sellers sold only pre-packed ice cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. Seventeen samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results:- 9 samples. Grade I 4 samples, Grade II 1 sample Grade III 3 samples Grade IV In addition: Twenty-four samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition, and all were found to be satisfactory. Periodical inspections were made to all premises and copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III and IV samples, special investigations were made at the premises to detect the causes of the unsatisfactory gradings. DESIGNATED MILK The following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960:- Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised milk 8 Sterilised milk 7 Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk 5 Twenty-seven samples of Designated milks were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, all of which satisfied the prescribed tests. Nineteen samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council were informed of the results which were satisfactory in each case. MILK AND DAIRIES (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1959 There were 147 registered milk distributors in the borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the borough from registered premises elsewhere was 19. 218 inspections of Milk shops and Dairies were made during the year. -49BAKEHOUSES There were 15 Bakehouses in use of which 3 were Basement Bakehouses. 35 inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1959 Five samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis and all were certified to comply with the regulations. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There are now no slaughterhouses in the borough. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 403 catering establishments in the borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens. All have received systematic inspection and close supervision during the year, and a satisfactory standard has been maintained. REGISTRATION OF FOOD PREMISES (Food and Drugs Act, 1955) There are now 94 premises registered under Section 16 of the above Act for the purpose of the Preparation or Manufacture of Sausages or Potted, Pressed, Pickled or Preserved Food intended for sale. AUTOMATIC FOOD VENDING MACHINES There are a number of milk vending machines in the Borough and these are under the control of registered dairymen who each day replenish the supplies, clean the machines and remove the cash. Samples of the milk have been taken for examination and found satisfactory. There are also vending machines which supply hot soup, coffee and a chocolate drink, and the mixing bowls in these machines are automatically rinsed with hot water after use. These machines are under the control of the owners of the premises and daily cleaning including the delivery tubes is carried out. -50- The only complaint received was in respect of a machine on the forecourt of a shop.

Beer, A.I.S. W., Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee:- "In presenting the Eleventh Annual Report of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee for the year 1961-62, we are pleased to show increased activity in every section of the work. More members have been enrolled, more old people escorted singly or in groups on organised holidays, more meals served in the restaurant and through Meals-on-Wheels, and a new venture, the Workshops for the Elderly scheme, has just completed its first year in operation. We have received generous help from the Borough Council and we should like to thank the Mayor, Councillor .Mrs. Waller, J.P.„ for her unfailing interest in our progress. Once again we must thank our M. P. and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Gunter, for their very active support throughout the year. We are proud to think that St. Alban's Hall has come to be a kind of second home to so many old age pensioners; it is an integral part of their lives and they enter into its activities with zest and appreciation. For those who cannot share in the companionship of their fellows because of illness or disability we are making a special effort - to bring them a measure of happiness by bringing them to St. Alban's Hall as often as possible and even taking them to places of entertainment. Various schemes are on foot to help them feel less out of the world and to relieve the frustration which comes from disablement and loneliness; we have acquired a projector and volunteers will show pictures of local and topical interest to the homebound in their own rooms; we have the services of a hairdresser one day a week and hope that it will be possible to expand this service. But all this is wishful thinking unless we can enlist the active and reliable help of more volunteers, especially for transport. We are very grateful for all the assistance received during the past year from very many people. Among our new-found friends are the members of the Lions' Club of Southwark, to whom we are profoundly indebted, and we welcome their representation on our committee. -55- The Meals-on-Wheels Service This service has increased considerably during the past year and somewhat strained the machinery of the organisation. A great improvement effected during the year is the introduction of the five-day service over the whole of the borough. There are six rounds covering the ground and often each van has to carry over 40 meals. The helpers continue their good work of reporting on cases in special need and take a tremendous interest in the homebound old people who eagerly await dinner-time because it means seeing a fresh face and having a chat with someone. Delivering dinners can be a wearying task, toiling up several flights of stairs to give a meal, sometimes to a reluctant old person who has to be persuaded to eat, but it is always rewarding to feel that this visit has at least broken the monotony of the day for one who cannot go out. The vans have just returned from delivering from 250 to 300 meals, either to the homebound or to the luncheon clubs; there are two of these, Nelson Square and Quinn Square, where old people who are mobile can get their dinner nearer to their homes. The past year has established a new record in the service of meals - an average of 9,000 per month has been reached, including the restaurant, meals-on-wheels and luncheon clubs services. The Restaurant at St. Alban's Hall The day's activities begin soon after 9.30 a.m. when the old people arrive for their morning coffee, sitting at a table chatting with a friend, with background music, or glancing at the morning paper. There are two sittings for dinner, the first at 12.15 p.m. and the meal costs l0d. When all is cleared away many linger on for a cup of tea (cost 1d.) and then make their way to the television room, or to one of the classes being held. If the weather is fine, they sit in the garden with friends. Workshop for the Elderly The scheme came into operation last May, and has been slowly but surely building up. At the beginning there were morning sessions only, with 8 to 10 people working for two hours. As soon as more Work was available, afternoon sessions were started, also for two hours, and there are now 18 people working in the morning and 8 in the afternoon. -56- The work undertaken has varied from making boxes, labelling bottles for chemicals, to stitching Christmas decorations and filling envelopes for a mail order firm; these are just a few types of work. At times it is difficult to obtain offers of work - there are periods when for economic or seasonal reasons, things seem at a standstill, and our Workshops have had to face these times of slackness. Progress cannot but be slow, but the scheme has already justified its existence by the therapeutic value and its effect on the old people. The aim of the Workshop is rehabilitation - to help those who think they are long past work to realise that they are not old because they are pensioners. There have been several cases of workers going back to fulltime jobs, and of one or two of those sent to us by hospitals and doctors, being restored to health. We are content to have achieved these results. Holidays More and more old people are taking advantage of our subsidised holidays scheme. In May last year 104 went to Bognor for a fortnight 62 went to Southsea, and in September another group went to Bognor. Also in September a coach party of 41, of those able to pay the full cost, spent a happy week at Newquay. Many handicapped cases have been found accommodation in convalescent homes which cater for their particular disability. The Lions' Club of Southwark sent a party of old people to Great Yarmouth for a week in the summer. For the first time this year the Borough Council sent old people away away under their special scheme which has certain conditions laid down, and those who qualify make a token payment of £1. This scheme, administered by the Southwark Old People's Welfare, has proved a great boon to a large number - for some it has meant that they have had the first real holiday by the sea in their whole lives. The Chiropody Clinic The demand for chiropody among the old people increases every year and far outstrips the possibilities of the existing number of clinics, especially for the home-bound who must be brought in or treated through the domiciliary service. It is hard to have to disappoint old people whose comfort depends so largely on this service and we should be so glad if it could be expanded to allow for more sessions. -57- Outings and Entertainments During the past year our old people have enjoyed a full programme of outings and our thanks are due to the many kindly, hospitable friends of St. Alban's Hall who have made these possible. The Women's Institutes again entertained parties of old people (varying from 35 to 40) at Aldbourne, Bletchingley, East Wittering and Edenbridge. The Southwark branch of Rotary organised an outing to Plaxtol, where the Women's Institute members were hostesses to a party of 35 old people. Through the kindness of Maidstone Branch of Rotary a party of 35 visited Sutton Valence, a country mansion now used as a Borstal Training Centre for girls; they were shown round the farm and residential quarters by the girls themselves and were very interested in the work of rehabilitation for young offenders. The Lions' of Southwark organised an outing to Littlehampton, and Mr. Bloomfield invited groups to Bexhill. The afternoon drives to Westerham are still highlights for the homebound. These visits to the sea or countryside, tea amid lovely garden surroundings, and often gifts of flowers and sweets, left happy memories to dwell upon in the dreary days of winter. On Wednesday evenings there has been a series of entertainments. After Old Time Dancing there have been Whist and Bingo Drives, alternating with dancing displays by children, concert parties and once an entertainment by an Over 60 Club. The local schools produced nativity plays and the South Bank group invited a party to a performance of Aladdin at Duthy Hall. One feels that Wednesday is a red-letter day for the old people at St. Albans Hall - they come in asking excitedly "What is on tonight"? and whatever the entertainment they enter whole-heartedly into the fun and express their immense appreciation of the efforts made for their amusement. Thanks are due to all who helped in providing these items of entertainment and especially to Mr. Richardson, the organiser, who devotes so much time to the service of the old people. -58- Several visits to the theatre were organised and were much enjoyed. We have the welfare of the handicapped foremost in mind this year, and as well as their Christmas party, a large group was taken to a performance at the Mermaid Theatre. We are very grateful to those friends who help on these occasions both with transport and with escort duties. Visiting There is plenty of scope for the welfare visitor and we are glad to have the services of our voluntary workers. Mrs. Crane has joined the group - she is always ready for any kind of job. Our Adoption scheme is going well, but we need more adopters - people who will adopt an old, lonely person, undertaking to visit regularly and make him or her feel that there is a family interested in a lonely person's welfare. Christmas Activities The Christmas Dinner was, as usual, a great success, and grateful thanks are due to the Southwark and Kennington Branches of Rotary for their generous contributions to the Christmas comforts. Hundreds of Christmas parcels were delivered from the United Africa Company and St. Christopher House to the old people, and Kennington Toc H also made gifts. General Activities The usual weekly classes have taken place - dress making, handcrafts and leather work. There have been drama and singing classes. Old Time Dancing is still a favourite on Wednesday evenings. The Choir took part in a Festival and achieved great success. The Over 60 Fellowship meets every Thursday afternoon under the leadership of the London City Missioner. The mobile library still functions once a week, and the homebound are also provided with reading matter." -59- Throughout the year, a total of 331 cases were dealt with by the Department, compared with 172 during 1960. This increase arose from the considerable extension of activities in this field consequent upon the Council's decision to appoint a Woman Health Officer for old people in September 1961.
