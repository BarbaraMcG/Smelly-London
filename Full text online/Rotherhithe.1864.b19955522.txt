The owners of property in Chilton-street, having memorialized the Vestry to have the footpaths of that street made up, kerbed and paved, the Vestry consented to do the work upon the owners contributing towards the cost thereof as follows, viz. For all houses that had been built less than five years, two-thirds of the cost of the said paving, and, For all houses built five years and upwards, one half of the cost of the said paving the Vestry contributing the remaining portion of the cost. 13 The Surveyor of Pavements made an estimate of the cost of such paving, and a contract was entered into for the works with Mr. Etheridge, for the sum of £441, winch was apportioned according to the above-mentioned scale, viz.

A memorial signed by 240 Ratepayers of this parish (representing a rating of £14,600) having been received by the Vestry in favour of the abolition of the Tolls and the Trust Roads, and the Vestry considering it expedient that all the Turnpike Gates and Toll Bars in the parish of Rotherhithe should be removed, they sent a communication to that effect (together with an intimation that they were prepared to undertake the repair and maintenance of the Turnpike Roads in this Parish, on the expiration of the Act of Parliament relating thereto), to the Secretary of State for the Home Department and to the Trustees of the Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, and Deptford Roads. In consequence of the Trustees not having applied to Parliament for an Act to extend their term, and as their powers will cease in November next, the Yestry appointed a Committee to investigate into and report as to the best course to be adopted for the maintenance of the portion of the Turnpike Roads that will then come under their control; this matter is still under the consideration of such Committee. The Yestry have agreed to contribute £50 towards the expenses incurred by the Acting Committee for the abolition of the Surrey side Turnpikes, in opposing the renewal of the various Turnpike Road Trusts on the south side of the Thames, including the Bill introduced into Parliament by the Trustees of the New Cross Roads, which Bill, if carried, would have inflicted a heavy expense on this Parish by throwing additional traffic on the Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, and Deptford Roads. This Vestry have also in conjunction with the Yestries of Bermondsey and St. John's, Southwark, petitioned the House of Commons, and memorialized Sir George Grey the Secretary of State for the Home Department, against the continuation of the Woolwich and Lower Road Turnpike Trust. In November last the Vestry received Parliamentary notices from the promoters of the following Railway schemes affecting property in the Parish of Rotherhithe, viz.:- The East London Railway (Thames Tunnel Line). The Metropolitan and South London Railway. 17 The London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (additional powers). An arrangement was made with the promoters of the East London Railway (Thames Tunnel Line), for the adoption of an easier gradient in the incline of the approach to the proposed bridge, to carry the Deptford Lower Road, and the Deptford Old Lower Road at WestField Terrace over the said Railway. The promoters, at the request of the Vestry, also inserted clause in their Rill for the protection and reinstatement of the footpaths and for the free passage of foot passengers and carriage traffic along the streets and roads, during the progress of the works, likewise, to secure the payment of the Parochial Rates, and particularly to maintain a passenger station in this parish as near as possible to the Surrey Commercial Dork Entrance, Deptford Lower Road. The Vestry petitioned the House of Commons in support of the scheme, and the Bill has since paasod into a Law. The Metropolitan and South London Railway was not proceeded with. The London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway (additional powers) scheme, only affecting two open sewers in this parish in the neighbourhood of the Rotherhithe Now Road, no steps were taken by the Vestry against the Bill. The South-Eastern Railway Company having submitted to the Vestry a plan of a proposed New Iron-girder Bridge upon brick piers in lieu of the present wooden Bridge, that carries the Bricklayers' Arms Braneh Railway across the Rotherhithe New Road, such Bridge to be 40 feet spun on the square in the clear, over both road and footpaths, the Vestry approved of the plan subject to certuin requirements being carried out, upon the erection of the Bridge, for the improvement of the road and footpaths at that spot. The Vestry have also approved of the proposed iron girder Bridge, to carry the extension of the Brighton Railway (South London Line), over the Rotherhithe New Road, such Bridge to be 70 feet span and considerably wider than the Road. Application having been made to the Vestry by Mr. William Aldred, to erect four houses in Church Street, at the corner of Princes Place, showing their intended position by a I'lan attached to the application, whereby he proposed to leave an entrance of the width of five feet six inches only to Princes Place, the Vestry, in order to secure the free diffusion of air to the houses in Princes Place, made an order that the Applicant should be required to leave an entrance or passage way 20 feet in width to Princes Place, in accordance with the 98th action of the 25th and 26th Vic., cap. 102; this Mr. Aldred declined to do, and ho proceeded with his buildings. The Vestry thereupon laid a statement of the circumstances of the case before the Metropolitan Board of Works, and requested that the Superintending Architect of that Board would determine the general line of buildings for Princes Place, under the 75th miction of the before mentioned Act. The Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works having heard the case as stated by both parties, at an interview appointed by him for that purpose, and he having also visited the spot, adjudged that the main fronts of the buildings forming the row of houses on the eastern side of Princes Place wus the general line of buildings on the eastern side of Princes Place, aforesaid. Mr. Aldred still persisting in carrying on the erection of his buildings, contrary to the before mentioned decision; the Vestry obtained a summons against him at tho Greenwich Police Court, and after several hearings and adjournments, the Magistrate, made an order for F 18 the demolition of so much of the said buildings as was beyond the general line of buildings on the eastern side of Princes Place, as decided by the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The order of the Magistrate had the effect of stopping the erection of the house at the corner of Princes Place, beyond the ground floor. Mr. Aldred then made a proposition to erect a room and roof over the said ground floor, and proceeded to carry the same out without the consent of the Metropolitan Board of Works or the Vestry; it was thereupon determined to enforce the Order of the Magistrate, and the roof erected by Mr. Aldred was removed by order of the Vestry. The public rights of way and plying places in the parish have been inspected by the General Purposes Committee, who made their Report to the Vestry upon the state thereof, and directions were given for the repair and reinstatement of the same, where necessary. The Vestry called the attention of the Conservators of the River Thames to the defective state of the steps at the following public plying stairs, viz., "Church Stairs," Elephant Stairs," and "King Stairs; "and the Conservators have determined to replace the said three several Stairs with new ones of iron. The Conservators of the Thames have also replaced the old Stairs at the " Dog and Duck," with new ones of iron. The Vestry have presented the following Petitions to the House of Commons (through John Locke Esq., M.P.) during the past year, viz. :- A Petition praying for the negation of any Bills, having for their object the diminution of Commons and Open Spaces in and around the Metropolis. A Petition against the " Justices of the Peace Procedure Bill." In consequence of the decease of Mrs. Harriett Nowne, the late Sextoness of the Parish Church, the Vestry, 011 the recommendation of the Rector and Churchwardens, determined to abolish that office, which was permanent for the life and good behaviour of the person appointed, and to substitute the office of Church Keeper, such office to be a yearlv one determinable after one month's notice. Mrs. llannah Kibett Small has been accordingly elected Church Keeper upon the before mentioned terms, at the salary of £35 per annum. APPENDIX No. I. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, From 25th March, 1864, to 25th March, 1865. To theVentry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, Appended to this Report are four Tables, showing the causes of death and the mortalitv during each quarter of the elapsed year, from March 25th, 1864, to March 25th, 1865; and 19 a fifth Table, compoaed by adding together the four others and representing the whole mortality of the twelve months. The first step to be taken in making a sanitary report upon any district, is to try to ascertain as nearly as possible the amount of its population; this is the pillar upon which the whole fabric of calculation exists. Now, the number of births in any locality is a tolerably sure sign of its population, and it is a remarkable fact that in Rotherhithe last year they slightly diminished, being 876, namely, 423 males, and 453 females against 881, namely, 434 males, and 447 females, born during the previous year from March 25th, 1863, to March 25th, 1864. I shall, therefore, take as my standard as I did in my last Report, 26,500 as the Sresent population of this parish : this number including the resident inhabitants, and the floating maritime people, foreign and English, in the docks and on the river, who average from 1000 to 1500 souls, all of the male sex. Five hundred and ninety-two deaths were registered, 310 males and 282 females, against 661 recorded between March 25th, 1863, and March 25th, 1864, showing a decrease of 72. The cause of this decrease may be explained by the gradual decline and total disappearance from Rotherhithe of two diseases, fever and small-pox. Between March 25th, 1863, and March 25th, 1864, there died in this locality, 79 persons from fever, and 23 from small-pox, in all 102; while in the past year, there were only 34 deaths from the former, and six from the latter (all unvaccinated), making a difference of 62 deaths from these diseases alone. Both appear absent from the parish at this present time, June 1st, 1865. Fever and sinall-pox are, to a certain degree, preventable diseases, the former principally haunting ill-ventilated, ill-drained, and ill-watered dwellings; the latter almost, if not entirely, cxtinguishable by the process of vaccination properly performed. If the people at large were as anxious to procure for themselves cleanliness, comfort, and health, as the Local Boards are to procure these things for them, we should soon witness a rapid decline of the above named maladies in this great Metropolis. Thirty-four inquests were held in Rotherhithe ; of these 15 were on the bodies of persons not belonging to the parish, these 15 being deducted from the whole mortality 592, leave 577, which may be taken as the true mortality ; so that admitting the population to be 26,500, the death rate last year was 21'8 in the 1000, against 24 in the 1000 the year preceding. 1 shall consider, as I have heretofore done, the tables of mortality which accompany this Report in regard to the seasons, the ages of the persons who died, and the diseases to which they succumbed. The healthiest quarter was the summer quarter, from Juno 24th, to S-ptember 29th, 1864, when only 133 deaths were registered : during the previous year, from June 24th, 1863, to September 29th, 1864, it was just the reverse, for the summer quarter was the moat unhealthy of the four, and the number of deaths 191. The largest mortality, 166, was in the winter, from Christmas 1864 to Lady-day 1865. The numbers were nearly equal, 146 and 147 respectively, from 25th March to 2 4th June, and from S-ptember 29th to Dec-ember 25th, 1864. Two hundred and five, or a little more than a third of the whole mortality, died under the age of two year*; 73 died between two and five, making together 278, or leas than half. The Smalleat amount of deaths, 18, taking human life by decades or periods of ten years, was * 1 hare Since found that I have somewhat underrated the floating population.- W. M. 20 between 10 and 20, a time, when man has passed through the diseases of childhood, and not yet acquired those that are fatal in the middle age. Seven of the 18 were accidents principally from drowning, which reduces the mortality From maladies to 11, not a fiftieth part of the whole (592). One hundred and seventeen died from zymotic diseases, 34 from fever, 6 from small-pox, 14 from measles, 20 from scarlatina, 15 from diarrhœa, 25 from hooping-cough, and three from diphtheria. All who succumbed to diarrhoea were children, under five years of age. There were 51 deaths from natural decay, one between 50 and 60, seven between 60 and 70, 24 between 70 and 80, and two between 80 and 90, the oldest being 96. Let us now turn to the sanitary work done. During the year 56 notices were served for miscellaneous nuisances, principally arising from imperfect drainage and accumulations of filth; and in 190 houses, proper drains were laid down and completed. There needs no comment on the importance of the above figures; they indicate that a large amount of amelioration as regards the sanitary condition of dwelling-houses has been effected throughout the Parish, and this quietly, and without any appeal to the Magistrate; for be it said with pleasure, no summons was taken out last year. Thus pursuing gently their onward course, and thus carrying out for nearly ten years the spirit of the Metropolitan Local Management Act without exercising any oppressive powers, the Vestry has done its best endeavours to make the place more healthy ; and let any impartial person compare the present state of Rotherhithe with its state eleven years ago, when Dr. Sutherland reported upon it, and he must, and he will admit, that in no locality in London has the work of sanitary improvement been more efficiently executed. But on the other side, are not the efforts of the Vestry to prevent disease more than counteracted by two huge nuisances over which they have no control, and which are allowed to remain ? I mean the Surrey Mill Stream, and the Earle Sewer, that roll their polluted tide through the heart of Rotherhithe. Part of the Surrey Mill Stream has been covered in, and some hopes are entertained that other portions of it will undergo the same process. The black ditch, or Earle Sewer, continues in the same state as it always has been; let us then earnestly pray that the Metropolitan Board will have pity on the inhabitants of Rotherhithe, and arch over or do away with this stream of impurities. The water supplied to the Parish by the two companies is of good quality. Some complaints have been made by residents in Glebe Terrace, and Cross Street, Deptford Road, of scantiness of supply. The Scavenging is well done. The Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses are regularly inspected. No complaint has ever been made against them. A fun has been put up at the Globe Wharf Manure Factory, whereby the gases generated in the process of manufacture, are driven into a high shaft. The nuisances formerly arising from the Factory have been thereby diminished. 1 he Atlas Works, Jamaica Level, a fish Manure Factory, have been frequently visited by the Sanitary Officers, and commented upon in my monthly reports. The machinery erected there for the suppression of the nuisance has certainly not succeeded in the hands of 21 the present manufacturer, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood having much suffered from the stenches exhaled at times from the above named works. In conclusion, Gentlemen, I venture to hope that the same amount of confidence, kind consideration, and assistance, in the performance of the important duties devolving upon me, and which it has been my privilege and great advantage hitherto to enjoy, will be extended to mo for the future, to enable me and encourage me to continue satisfactorily the performance of those duties ; the groat aim and object of my brother Officers and self, having always been honestly and faithfully to carry out the views of the Vestry for the benefit of the Parishioners, and the improvement of the Parish. Yours respectfully, June 1st, 1865. MURDOCH. Table of the Mortality in Rotherhithe, from March 25th, 1864, to March 24th, 1865. First Quarter, from March 25th, 1864, to June 24th, 1864. DISEASES.
