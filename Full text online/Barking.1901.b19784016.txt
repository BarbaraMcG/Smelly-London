BARK 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE YEAR 1901. HEALTH OF THE TOWN DURING 1901. March 4th, 1902. To the Chairman and Members of the Sanitary Committee. Gentlemen, The principal feature from a health point of view, of the year that has lately come to a close, was, that while the figures of sickness shewed a decided increase, the mortality returns are the lowest since 1896. The number of cases of Notifiable Infectious Diseases being 303, against 210 the year before. The total number of Deaths from all causes during the same period, being 347, against 384 the year before, or with the necessary additions of persons belonging to the District dying in Institutions outside, 383, against 399 ; the rate per 1,000 of the former being 15 9 and 17.6, and of the latter 17 8 and 18.5. The different age periods give results as follows:— Under 1 year 159 1 year and under 5 62 or 221 under 5 years The remaining 162 occurring in the remaining age periods : 36 only living over 65. Thus it is very clear that the height of our death rate is largely due to the infant mortality, the death rate of persons over 5 years of age only working out at 7.4 of the estimated population. There is, however, some improvement this year on this head also. The infantile mortality rate which in 1900 was 203 per 1,000 births registered, has dropped in 1901 to 161. With regard to causation, Diarrhoea again heads the list with 58 deaths, against 75 last year. Bronchitis 29, against 44; Phthisis 27 ; other Tubercular Diseases 24; making a total ascribed to Tubercular Diseases of 51, against 33. Pneumonia 25, against 37; Meales 16, against 3. 3 With respect to Infectious Diseases, the results are encouraging: Scarlet Fever, 3 deaths or .13 per 1,000. Diphtheria 3 „ .13 „ Enteric Fever 3 „ .13 „ In 1900 the rates were .04, 22, and .84 respectively. I think the foregoing figures indicate only that in the present year every effort should he made to combat the spread of Tubercular Disease, the fact that such diseases are most infectious being absolutely ignored. I intend to make some suggestions to you on the subject in the near future. Diarrhoea also, in summer months, calls for a strict watch on milk supplies. The birth rate has again risen, being 41.3 against 36.4 last year. For details, I must refer you to my annual report shortly to be laid before you. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, C. F. FENTON, Medical Officer of Health. THE ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health of the District of Barking Town for the year ending December 31st, 1901. To the Chairman and Members of the Barking Town Urban District Council. Gentlemen, The population estimated up to the middle of the year was 21,730. Population as per census of 1891, 14,301; 1901, 21,547. Showing a decennial increase of 7,5^46. Area in acres 3,184; 3,809 land; 5 water; 219 acres tidal water; 87 foreshore. Persons per acre, average for the whole District 5'6 on the above population. Numbers of houses in the Town, March, 1901 (census):— Inhabited Uninhabited Houses. In occupation Not in occupation Building. North Ward 783 27 34 4 South Ward 9.31 9 38 24 East Ward 1,110 4 17 66 West Ward 1,027 26 70 2 3,851 66 159 96 6 Total number of inhabited houses in the Town as per census of 1901, 3,851; 1891, 2,561. This compared with 1891, gives the following increase: 1,290. Number of persons per inhabited house is given in the 1891 census returns as 5.5 ; in 1901, 5.6. In 1900 there were 398 deaths, and 783 births. The figures for 1901 were 383 and 799 respectively. The natural increase of the population by excess of births over deaths was therefore 416, as against 385 in 1900. Water Supply. The Public Water Supply has been derived from the same source as in previous years. The new Act obtained by the South Essex Water Company comes into force on January 1st, 1902. By the provisions of this Act the chargcs of the Company have been in many instances revised with great benefit to the consumer. I regret that in many of the most recently constructed houses in the Town, it is allowable for the domestic water supply to be derived from a storage cistern only. I think the Council should obtaiu power to stop this arrangement. No advance has been made in extending the public supply to Creeksmonth or Choats Lane. Negotiations are still in hand as regards Crceksmouth. For list of property not supplied by town water, see my report for 1900. Food and Milk Supply. Frequent inspections are made wherever food is exposed for human consumption. Large quantities of food of all kinds, rabbits frozen and fresh, fish, vegetables, &c., are brought down and sold in the Broadway on Friday and Saturday evenings. Several seizures have been made, but on the whole the quality of the articles sold have greatly improved. Both myself and the Sanitary Inspector visit the market regularly Twenty-nine samples of Milk, and 19 of Butter have been submitted to the Public Analyst during the year. All the samples were genuine. (For other articles see Sanitary Inspectors report). The prevalence of Enteric Fever in the town towards the close of the year led me to make a special investigation into the condition 7 of the Dairies and Cowsheds in the Town. In one instance the condition was most unsatisfactory, and the necessary alterations are not yet completed. Bakehouses. Number 20. These come under the Factory and Workshops Act, and special regulations are in force dealing with these conditions, &c. Slaughterhouses. Registered 3 Licensed 1 Special Bye-laws under Section 169, Public Health Act 1875, are in force with respect to these. Bye=laws in Force in District. 1. Nuisances, 2. Houses let in Lodgings. 3. Slaughterhouses 4. Common Lodging Houses. 5. Buildings. 6. Paving of Yards and Open Spaces. 7. Mortuary. Regulations under Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, and Bakehouses. The building bye-laws need extension. There appears to be no power given therein to insist on new houses being built in a sanitary manner. Several instances of this have occurred lately. Burial Grounds. Cemetery.—This burying ground continue- in excellent order Churchyard.—The condition of this ground is much more satisfactory than formerly. I much regret that no steps have as yet been taken to lay out the principal walks for the use of the public. Inspection of District. This is divided into two parts:— 1. Town. 2. Country Districts 8 TOWN. Table of various Courts and Alleys in the Town of Barking, shewing their present condition and requirements. Sanitary Improvements Required. Holly Square, Tanner street Paving needed at rear of houses. Drains need examining and ventilating. Tanner Square, „ ,, Paving required round the houses, More conveniences for slop-water and better water supply. Drains have been relaid and ventilated. St. Johns Retreat, North street The main drains have been re-laid and ventilated. The Court also requires paving. Braintree Terrace Drains have been re-constrncted and ventilated. Concrete should be laid round the houses. Red Lion Place Paving required. Northbury Cottages Main drain requires to be re-laid and ventilated. Alma Place Main drains having been found defective, and have been re-laid and ventilated, but probably the house connections require inspection. The unpaved portion of this Court should be dealt with. Back Reform Place The drains have been re-laid and ventilated. Nelson Street Main drains have been re-laid and ventilated. Trafalgar Street Trafalgar Square Trafalgar Place Crookes Court, East Street These houses have been reported as unfit for human habitation, and have been voluntarily closed, but no order had been obtained from the Court to this effect. Morgan's Court, East street This Court has been partly paved, the drains have been re-laid and ventilated, and most of the houses put into habitable repair. It would be better if the court were completely paved. 9 Inspection of District—continned. Sanitary Improvements required. Back Lane The main sewer needs ventilating. The defects in some of this property have been rectified. In conjunction with the Surveyor I reported on the condition of this property(see printed minutes page 463, 1899-1900). White's Court All the houses here except one have been re-constructed so as to form a Mission Room. The drains have been re-laid and ventilated. Bifron's Square More sanitary accommodation (this work is in hand). Garden Place The drains to these properties have been re-laid and ventilated. Extra w.c. accommodation has been provided, and flushing cisterns attached. The yards still urgently need to be proproperly paved. Suffolk Place Wellington Buildings Parson's Buildings Pad nell Place Lindsell's Court This has been made up under the 150th section of the Public Health Act, 1875. Orchard Avenue Gas Yard I am glad to be able to report this Court has been paved throughout, and its condition is therefore much improved thereby. It has lately been taken over by the Council as a street repairable by the inhabitants at large. The condition of some of the houses is far from satisfactory. This road has been made up and paved. Morgan's Yard The sewers have been re-laid and ventilated, and the Court paved. Factory Road and Emily Cottages Drains having been examined, need relaying and ventilating. The back yards to this property should be concreted. Park Terrace Drains need re-laying and ventilating. Albert Terrace ” ” ” 10 Inspection of District—continued. Sanitary Improvements required. Collier Row Drains need re-laying and ventilating. Collier Place Drains belonging to this property have been re-constructed and ventilated. Arthur Cottages, East street Drains belonging to this property have been re-constructed and ventilated, and the property put in good repair. Note.—In all the foregoing in which the house connections have not been inspected, I recommend this be proceeded with forthwith, and re-paving of yards uuder new Bye-laws. Barking Place : The drain here has been re-laid and ventilated by the Counoil. Back Lane : The main sewer needs more ventilation. Inspection of Rural parts of District. (a) River Roding. An intolerable nuisance was again caused by the condition of this river during the summer and autumn. Towards the close of the year the new effluent sewer of the Ilford Urban District Council was ready for use, and so the contribution of Ilford to the contamination of the stream was stopped. One important point was established by myself and the County Medical Officer, viz. : the pollution of the tidal portion of tbe river by the London County Council effluent on a flood tide. This is a very serious factor in dealing with this question, as the effluent from both Northern and Southern Outfalls during the summer was very foul. The facts gleaned by myself and the Medical Officer of Health for the County, were confirmed by a deputation of this Council, who visited the portion of the River Thames in question. The yacht belonging to the Thames Conservanoy, being kindly lent for the occasion. 11 Now that Hford is eliminated, it will be easier to determine how far the up river and down river authorities contribute to the pollution. (b) Handtrough River. Upper Portion—1 am not aware of any nuisance being caused by this stream during the year. Lower Portion.—This portion still receives the East Ham effluent, which is by no means a good one. Until the East Ham Council decide upon a new Drainage and Sewage Disposal Soheme, its condition will remain the same. (c) Loxford Brook. Until the Ilford Council discontinued using this watercourse as an effluent discharge, an abominable nuisance was the result, but since the construction of their effluent sewer into the Thames, I have not had any cause to complain. I have had occasion to complain of the deposition of pressed and treated sludge along the banks of the brook, and it has been discontinued (d) Other Watercourses, &c. I have not had reason to complain of these watercourses recently, and the method now adopted of covering the " rough dust " with excavation material, or " blue billy," has decidedly improved the condition of the Dust Shoots. Housing of the Working Classes. The Artisans Dwellings lately erected by the Council, 85 in number, are now all in occupation. It has been found possible to let them at a rental of 6/9 per week, which includes rates. The houses are fitted with the electric light, and which is paid for through a slot meter. I understand it is the intention of the Sanitary Committee to go into the question oftenemcnt houses, to determine the practicability of providing a separate tenement (really a house) for a rental of 3s. and 5s. a week. There is a tendency for cottage rents in the town to decrease. 12 Sanitary Improvements Effected in 1900. The Surveyor reports that the drains to the following properties have been re-laid :— 45 to 47 Romford Street. Back Reform Place (part). 72, 74, and 76, East Street. No. 6 Axe Street. 1 to 3, Bifrons Place. 6 and 8, Heath Street. While in addition all the houses on the Kennedy Estate have been connected up to the sewerage system. Inspection, in addition to above, of almost all the West Ward. Special inspection and examination in connection with Infectious Disease. Chief Industries of the District. 1. Beckton Gas Works—This includes all kinds of labour; coal porters, general labourers, stokers, engineers, &e. 2. hawes' Chemioal Manure Works—There are several ments here also. (a) Manufacture of Manures and Disinfectants. (b) Manufacture of Sheep Dip. In connection with which I have received no further complaints since my last report. (e) The manufacture of Strong Acids. 3. Agriculture gives employment to many. 4. Warne's India Rubber Factory—More hands yet to be added. 5. Tar Works and several Factories of a similar nature. 6. A large and increasing number of the population, are workers from the Metropolis. 13 Offensive Trades. Several trades coming under this heading, viz.: sausage skin making, fish skin curing, are now being carried on in the district. No complaint has been brought to me during the past year of nuisance arising therefrom. Scavenging. This is in my opinion very well carried out Collection of House Refuse. This is undertaken by the Council and is fairly well carried out. The accumulation of rough dust at the Council's sboot is not in my opinion a proper method for its disposal. I think there is little doubt that these accumulations of rubbish are decidedly damaging to the infantile health of the town. The dust shoot belonging to the East Ham Council on the Beckton Marshes is also much to be condemned, and I hope very soon that a destructor will be provided by both Councils. Fish Offal Collection. The Fishmongers of the town are provided with properly constructed iron pails, which are removed by the Council's men, and emptied outside the town. Sewerage of the District. The method of precipitation adopted is still the same as formerly; 1 think some modification of the present system might be adopted with advantage. Over-the-Oates. All the houses have now been connected to the new sewer. Kennedy Estate. The main sewerage work here is also completed, the private house drains'are nearly all connected, Ventilation of Sewers. In my opinion, the method of ventilating the public sewers, by means of the private house drain ventilator, is open to serious objection. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. 15 Number of cases notified during 1901, 303. The case rate for the whole of the town 13.9, this is excluding Diarrhoea oases. The distribution of Infectious Disease in the several Wards is follows :— 1900 North 48 Rate 10 per 1,000 persons living South 51 „ 9 „ „ East 49 „ 7.8 „ „ West 62 „ 9.1 „ „ 210 1901. North 51 Rate 12'0 per 1,000 persons living South 84 „ 16.6 „ „ East 80 „ 13.1 „ „ West 88 „ 14.2 „ „ 303 Action taken to Prevent the Spread of Infectious Disease, General : 1. House visited by Sanitary Official as soon as practicable after the receipt of notification. 2. Isolation of Patient or removal to Infectious Disease Hospital. 3. Disinfectants supplied gratis (whenever needed). 4. Bedding, &c., disinfected by steam (Washington Lyon's Patent), wherever necessary, or in certain cases burnt. 5. Houses examined with a view of detecting; defects in drainage, or any other sanitary imperfection. 6. Printed precautions circulated, and verbal instructions given. 7. Fumigating, whitewashing, repapering, and cleansing of premises, whenever considered neoessary. 8. Notice at once sent to the Clerk of the School Board, and School Attendance Officer. 9. Notice sent privately to Pawnshops. 16 Scarlet Fever, No. of Cases. Deaths. No. treated in Hospital. Percentage treated in Hospital.

North Ward 21 South Ward 31 East Ward 48 West Ward 34 134 Remarks. This disease was very prevalent during the autumn months. The cases for the most part were mild, only one death occurring in those removed to Ho-pial. I am not aware of any return cases arising from convalescents returning home. I was not able to trace how the disease was introduced into the town. It was fairly evenly distributed in the four Wards into which the District is divided. Enteric Fever. No. of Cases. Deaths. No. treated in Hospital. Percentage treated in Hospital. Death rate per cent. 1901 68 3 35 51 4.4 1900 50 7 38 76 14 1899 52 3 33 63.4 5.7 1898 51 2 23 74.1 6.2 17 Wards. No. of Cases North Ward 11 South Ward 20 East Ward 11 West Ward 26 68 Remarks. From the above distribution it will be seen that the South and West Wards are responsible for 67 per cent. of the cases. In 17 cases only was I able to trace serious defects in the house drainage. Investigations were made in every case as to milk supply, water, butter, meat, vegetables, fish, &c., with results which were somewhat confusing. Some of the cases appeared to originate from milk from a source which was certainly nut above suspicion, though the report of the Bacteriologist reads :—" I find nothing to indicate that this milk was sewage polluted, or that it contained the Thyphoid Bacillus." The water that the cows were drinking contained— 1. " The Bacill Coli Communis." 2. " Bacillus Enteritis Sporogenes." " It was impossible to detect the Bacillus Typhonus in the water." The conditions under which the above samples were taken have been greatly improved. The most striking feature in the cases this year appeared to be the readiness with which other members of the same family contracted the disease from one another. In no less than 26 cases this appeared to be the cause. Among the small houses inhabited by the working classes, in which isolation is impos???ible and the precautions necessary to be observed in order to prevent the spread of such disease, but understood removal to hospital is imperative if an epedemic is to be avoided. 18 Seasonal Influence. 1899 1900 1901 No. of Cases.

Some of the cases treated in Hospital were very severe, but for the most part the cases were of a mild type. It would be of the greate-t assistance in dealing with this malady, if some arrangement could be made to have a bacterial diagnosis in every doubtful case. Anti toxin serum proved most invaluable, especially in the laryngeal form of the disease. Diphtheria and School Attendance. (The numbers refer to children between 4 and 14 years of age).

During the autumn months, with many cases in the Metropolitan area, and in several Districts near at hand, it was considered advisable to anticipate the occurrence of the disease in this town. Up to the end of the year (Dec. 31st, four casus only were notified, and all these of a mild character. 21 The first two cases were contracted, without doubt on a visit to London about a fortnight previously, and the third and fourth from contact with cases in a neighbouring district. They had all been vaccinated in infancy, and in one case, aged 9 months, vaccination had only been performed 5 months before the Small Pox attack- The precautionary measures adopted in this district are:— 1. Isolation of Patient by removal to Hospital. 2. Disinfection of room, bed, bedding, and furniture. 3. Disinfection of contacts, persons, and clothing, and other parts of house if considered advisable. 4. If unable to carry out above with contacts in house, they are removed to shelter, whilst house or rooms are stripped, &c. 5. Notification of case to School Board or other School Managers, and Pawn Shops. 6. Notification of contacts to" Medical Officer of Health of other Districts, if residing or working out of the Town. 7. Notification to Vaccination Officer for attendance of Public Vaccinator at house or houses where contacts reside. 8. Observation of contacts during quarantine period 9. Removal of house refuse by special cart and burning of same. I may add that during the 3 months that have elapsed since the close of the past year the disease has appeared many times, but has not so far assumed epidemic character. I intend to issue a full detailed report late in the year (1902). Influenza. Deaths. 1901 4 1900 2 1899 6 1898 5 1897 4 22 Cancer. Deaths. 1901 11 1900 12 1899 8 1898 7 1897 7 Further Sanitary Requirements of District. 1. Much still remains to be done in the relaying and ventilation of drains and sewers in many parts of the town, in rendering many houses more habitable by paving round them. 2. More ventilation to the public sewers. 8. Sanitary tenements at low rental for the labouring classes. 4. Fresh water supply for Creeksmouth and other parts of District not yet connected with public supply. 5. Hospital.—Site plans for a permanent Hospital are in course of preparation. It is intended to begin the new Hospital by erecting first of all a Nursing Home and Administrative Block, with Caretaker's cottage. 6. Public Sanitary Conveniences for both sexes are urgently needed in several parts of the town. 7. The erection of a Destructor for house refuse, &c. 8. The remodelling of the Sewage Works. Statistics. The death rates for the past ten years are set out fully in the tables at the end of the book. The nett rate for the current \ear works out at at 17.6 per 1,000 of the estimated population, and the crude rate, i.e., the rate without the necessary deductions and additions, works out at 15.9, which is the lowest for the past ten years, with the single exception of 1894. 23 The populations, number of deaths, and death rates of the various Wards, are as follows.—(The populations are from the census returns).— Population. No. of Deaths. Death Rate. North Ward 4215 71 16 South Ward 5073 83 15 East Ward 6063 83 13 West Ward 6196 111 17 21,547 348 15 For the year 1900 the West Ward was very much higher than all the rest; the figures were:— North 13 South 13 East 14 West 22 During 1901 house to house inspection of the Ward has been carried out, and many improvements have been effected. The older parts of the town, much of which is in the West Ward, requires constant attention, the house connections with the sewer being especially suspicious. On February 25th, a resolution was adopted by the Council, " directing the Surveyor to give attention to the house connections to the sewer." Diarrhœa, 1901. The number of cases notified during the year 1901, was 189, as against 185 in the previous year. Every case has been investigated as to the probable cause, and the result of these inquiries are found tabulated below. Overcrowding. —4. Site of House.—Not concreted, 118 out of 189, or 62 per cent., as against 75 per cent. the year before ; Back Yards not paved or defective, 19 or 10 per cent., 1900 11.7 per cent. Miscellaneous Sanitary Defects, 54 or 28 per cent., as against 23 per cent. 24 Mother goes out to work, 26 cases, or 13 per cent. as against 11 per cent. Comparing the two years in which the disease has been notifiable, we find the results very similar. Uncoecreted sites head the list with 64 per cent., and only 13 per cent of the cases occur in connection with the mothers going out to work, and therefore possible neglect to the infant. Classify the deaths only in the same way we find— Per Cent. Site of house, 26 cases 58 Badly paved and defective yards, 3 6 Sanitary defects, 17 38 Mother goes out to work, 8 18 Seasonal Influence.

The mean temperature of the air in July, 1901, was 64 8; in August, 62.3; and September, 57.9. The July temperature was above the average 3., and 2.5 bring above the average of 130, and 60 years respectively, but 2. and 0.9 lower than in 1900 and 1899, and 3.3 higher than in 98. So that in July the mean temperature was lower and the rainfall below the average of 86 years. The number of cases notified in July was 24 in excess of 1900. The prevailing direction of the wind was N., N.E., E., S.E. In only 9 days was the wind from S., S.W, and W. In July, 1900, S.W. winds were prevalent. I have not been able at present to determine any connection between the temperature and humidity of the air, and the disease. 25 The question of earth temperature has been exhaustively investigated by others.

Nursed by Mother 41 per cent. 30 per cent. nearly Artificially Fed 19 „ 58 „ Mixed . . .. 40 „ 18 „ 26 These figures are somewhat conflicting. In 1900 I was inclined to think that the balance of evidence was in favour of some specific organism, not necessarily connected with artificial feeding, but in 1901 the figures seem to favour the hypothesis that artificial feeding is favourable to the growth of such organism, if such there be. The annual mortality rate of 1,000 persons living for diarrhœa in this District during the past three year have been:— 1899 2.09 1900 3.1 (This year should be higher on corrected population) 1901 2.61 Every effort is being made to remedy all sanitary defects, such as ill paved yards, leaky or blocked drains, accumulations of rubbish, &c., to store cows milk after boiling in stoppered vessels, &c., &c., and yet I am bound to confess the results so far are not very encouraging. The objection to parents allowing their children to enter hospital until in a moribund condition has rendered that method of treatment up to the present abortive. The question of providing a sterilizer or pasteurizing milk supply during July, August, and September, is now having consideration, and I intend to personally inspect the cowsheds and milkshops during the coming season. Notification I believe to be the only means of dealing with the disease, as the milk supply condition of premises is discovered and remedied sooner than any other way that I know of. For financial reasons it will not be proposed this year. The question is worthy of the strictest investigation, especially from a bacteriological point of view, and it seems to me by far the most serious item with which the Health Authority of this District has to deal.

No further beds have been reserved for Diphtheria; fortunately during the past few months there has been a great diminution in the number of cases notified. In the near future better accommodation will have to be provided for the Caretaker, as the cottages are old and damp, in fact scarcely habitable. The old laundry was destroyed by fire in September, and a new and far more commodious building has been erected in its stead. Negotiations for the purchase of some acres of the adjoining land are still in progress. During the past year the following patients have been treated in the Wards:— 1901. 1900. 1899. Diarrhœa — 2 — Scarlet Fever 103 63 33 Diphtheria 15 32 17 Enteric Fever 26 33 23 144 130 73 The number of deaths have been 4, or a death rate of 2.7 per cent. Death rate in 1900 = 6.l per cent. 30 Scarlet Fever. In the autumn months the admission from this disease were heavy. The maximum number of cases of this disease accommodated the Wards, was 42. I do not know of any case (except the fatal one) in which there were any sequelae, and only 3 which suffered from Albuminuria. A Discharging Ward is greatly needed. Diphtheria. The Diphtheria Wards in the later months of the year being utilized for Scarlet Fever cases, Diphtheria patients had to be accommodated elsewhere, or isolated as well as possible at home. Another Ward is wanted at the Hospital for this disease. Enteric Fever. Abundant evidence was forthcoming as to the necessity for removal of these cases. Great difficulty was experienced in finding room for them anywhere, consequently the disease spread from one to another. No less than 23 cases were traceable to infection in this way. In the autumn the Electric Light was laid on to the Ward, Nurses Rooms, and the oil lamps in Grounds were also done away with and electric light substituted. This has been a great benefit. Hospital Sewage Disposal.—The amount being small some difficulty is found in getting the coke filters to act. A fresh arrangement is now being tried, which is likely to prove more successful. General Remarks. I need hardly say that the year 1901 has been a most arduous one for the whole of the Sanitary Staff. In the autumn the notifications of Scarlet Fever and Enteric Fever were abnormally heavy, and with a Small Pox Epidemic in London, the outlook was anything but cheerful. On the other hand there is evidence of progress in the healthiness of the town. The death rate is lower, and whilst there have been a good number of cases the fatality has been remarkably low, thus shewing that the type of disease has been mild. 31 I am glad to own my obligations to the Sanitary Inspector and every one of his staff. Their cheerful devotion to the extra labour that has been necessary deserves all praise. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, C. F. FENTON.

To the Chairman and Members of the Barking Town Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the following report of work done in the Public Health Department during the year 1901. Inspection has been made of 1,741 houses, and works of sanitary improvements carried out in 1,004 these. The following list of Streets, Courts, &c., have been inspected under systematic house to house inspection:— North Street (part of) Alma Place Cowbridge Lane Back Reform Place Union Street Romford Street Braintree Terrace Bridge Street Back Lane Heath Street Fisher Street Morgan's Quay Factory Road Emily Cottages Collier Row Collier Place Albert Terrace Park Terrace Hart Street Hardwicke Street Orchard Avenue Bifron Street Gascorgne Road (part of) Boundary Road (part of) The number of preliminary notices served during the year were 1,004, and only in 71 cases was it requisite to serve statutory notices, and in no case was it necessary to take any further legal steps. 35 Infectious disease has occurred in 228 houses, which have been subsequently fumigated. Each house was immediately inspected on receipt of notification, and in a number of cases defects were found, mostly defective drains, uncovered storage cisterns, and dirty houses. 270 lots of bedding, clothing, &c., have been disinfected in the Council's apparatus, and 76 rooms were stripped and limewhited after cases of Scarlet Fever. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. —73 samples were taken during the year and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, consisting of:— Milk 29 Butter 19 Ale 4 Flour 15 Syrup 4 It is satisfactory to note that in no case was it necessary to take proceedings against the Vendors. Margarine.—Two samples were taken for exposing margarine without a label. In one case proceedings were not ordered, and in the other summons was taken out but could not be served, as the Vendor had left the town and his whereabouts not traced. Dairies and Cowsheds.—There are 5 Cowsheds and 40 Milkshops on the register, all of which have been frequently inspected. The Cowsheds require many improvements in the way of paving, ventilating, lighting, &c., to bring them in conformity with the new regulations. One Cowshed has been drained and connected with the sewer. Slaughter-houses.—I Licensed, and 3 Registered Slaughterhouses in the District, all of which have been inspected at intervals and found to be kept in accordance with the Bye-laws. Regular visits have been paid to the Markets, Shops, and Stalls throughout the year. Mortuary.—During the year 32 bodies have been received into the Mortuary, and 8 post mortem examinations were made. 36 I beg in conclusion to append a summary of the work carried out in the abatement of nuisances. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, H. WOOD, Inspector of Nuisances. SUMMARY.
