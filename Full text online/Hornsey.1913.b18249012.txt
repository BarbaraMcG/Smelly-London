To His Worship the Mayor, the Aldermen, and the Councillors of the Borough of Hornsey. Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my Report on the health of the Borough of Hornsey for the year 1913. The death-rate is again a very low one, a little under that of 1912, and about equal to the average of recent years. The Infantile Mortality is the lowest on record in Hornsey, or I think for any large town. Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria were somewhat more prevalent than in 1912, but were much less prevalent than has been the case on taking an average of ten years. These diseases were of a very mild type as shown by the fact that there were only 3 fatal cases of Diphtheria out of 115 cases notified, and not a single fatal case of Scarlet Fever out of 206 cases notified. The mildness of the diseases was in fact one of the chief causes of the somewhat greater prevalence, as the primary cases were often unrecognised owing to the slight symptoms, until further cases had arisen. It is evident that the public health of the district maintains the high standard to which we are accustomed. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HAROLD COATES, M.D., D.P.H. 3 BOROUGH OF HORNSEY. Summary of Statistics. Area in acres 2,874 Rateable value (District Rate) £672,944 Population Census, 1901 72,056 1911 84,592 Estimated Population 1913 (June 30th) 88,160 Number of persons per acre, 1913 30'6 ,, ,, ,, house, 1913 5.032 Estimated birth-rate per 1,000 living, 1913 16.16 Average birth-rate for previous 10 years 18.65 Estimated death-rate per 1,000 living, 1913 9.34 Average death-rate for previous 7 years 9.31 Deaths under 1 year of age, per 1,000 births, 1913 56 Average number of deaths under 1 year of age for previous 10 years 73 Death-rate from Zymotic diseases, 1913 0.45 Average death-rate from Zymotic diseases for previous 10 years 0.60 Death-rate from Phthisis 0.62 ,, ,, all forms of Tuberculosis 0.78 ,, ,, Cancer 1.08 Population.—The estimated population at the middle of 1913 was 88,160. At the middle of 1912 the estimated population was 85,522. The gain during the twelve months 1912-1913 is, therefore, 2,638 persons, which is equal to an increase of 3'08 per cent. The gain during the preceding twelve months 1911-1912 was 826 persons, equal to 0'9 per cent., so that the rate of increase has been much greater during 1912-1913 than in the preceding year, and is the highest since the year 1903-4. The enumerated population at the date of the last census, April 1st, 1911, was 84,592, and the gain in the years from the date of the Census to June 30th, 1913, has been 3,568. The following table shows the estimated population of the Borough at the middle of each year from 1901. These figures are all based on the number of inhabited houses in the Borough as 4 ascertained from the rate books, and the average number of persons per house as given in the Census returns, and differ somewhat from the Registrar General's estimate, which is calculated by a different method. The population of the Borough at the middle of 1913, as estimated by the Registrar General, was 87,596. Year.

The statistical calculations of this report are based on the estimated population of 88,160. The following table shews the yearly increase per cent, for each year since the Census of 1901:— Increase of population during the year.

The increase for the last year being 2,638, is considerably more than twice the average yearly increase. The "natural increase" of population during 1913, i.e., excess of births over deaths, was 601. In the preceding year the "natural increase" was 545, so that this year there is a gain in this respect. The estimated population at the end of each Quarter of 1913 was as follows:— End of first quarter 87,381 ,, second ,, 87,719 ,, third ,, 88,509 ,, fourth ,, 89,033 The following table shews, for each Ward of the Borough, the population estimated at the middle of the years, for the years 1912 and 1913, with the increase or decrease during the 12 months.

Highgate is at the top with an increase of 759, followed by West Hornsey with 601 and Crouch End with 482. Muswell Hill and North Haringey have also considerable increases. East Hornsey, which last year had a loss of 33, has now a gain of 177. 6 Stroud Green shews a loss of 3 on last year's figures. For the whole Borough there is a gross gain of 2,641 and a loss of 3, or a nett gain of 2,638. The papulation of each Ward, as enumerated at the Census, April 1st, 1911, and as estimated at the middle of the year, June 30th, 1913, is shewn as follows:— Ward. Population, Census 1911.

With a population of 88,160, this gives us 30 6 persons per acre. Twelve years ago there were 25 persons per acre in Hornsey. As is shewn in the table below, the number of persons per acre varies greatly in different parts of the district. North Ilaringey is the most thickly populated, having 79 persons per acre, then follow West Hornsey with 60 and East Hornsey with 57 persons per acre. Crouch End, Highgate and Muswell Hill, each with 17 persons per acre, are yet the least densely populated areas.

This is an increase of 40 as compared with the number of births registered in 1912. In the preceding twelve months (1912 compared with 1911) there was a decrease of 94 in the recorded births. Forty-two of the births were illegitimate (25 in 1912). Twelve of the births occurred at the New Edmonton Infirmary and 27 at other Institutions and places outside the Borough.

The yearly average number of deaths registered in the Borough during the previous ten years was 650. The death-rate' calculated on these figures (gross death-rate) is 7'66 per thousand of the mean population for the year. This is 0'5 lower than the corresponding rate last year. This, however, includes only deaths actually registered in the Borough, and dees not include those of Hornsey people dying elsewhere. There were 180 Hornsey people who died outside the district during 1913, viz.:— 53 in the Edmonton Workhouse and Infirmary, 6 in other Infirmaries, 17 in the Great Northern Central Hospital, 56 in other Hospitals outside the Borough, 12 in Lunatic Asylums, and 36 in various other places. On the other hand there were 32 deaths registered in Hornsey of persons non-resident in the district. To get the nett deaths belonging to Hornsey we must add to the number of deaths registered in the Borough the number (180) of Hornsey people dying outside the Borough, and deduct the number (32) of deaths registered in Hornsey of persons who normally resided in other districts. This gives us the nett number of deaths belonging to Hornsey as 824, a decrease of 16 from the corresponding number for 1912. The death-rate calculated on these figures is the nett deathrate, and for the past 9 years is as follows:— Year. Nett death-rate. 1905 8.78 1906 9.57 1907 9.35 1908 9.14 1909 9.47 1910 8.77 1911 9.58 1912 9.82 1913 9.34 17 It is only for these nine years that the comparison can be made, as for the years before 1905 the figures referring to deaths of Hornsey people outside the Borough cannot be obtained. The nett death-rate for 1913 is 0'48 lower than that of 1912. During the last 9 years the death-rate lias been very steady and has kept at a very low figure.

The rates for years previous to 1905 are not comparable, as it is not possible now to obtain the numbers so as to apply the correction for deaths of residents and non.residents. Stroud Green has again the lowest death-rate, but the rate has gone up, being 7.5 this year as compared with 6'9 for 1912. Other Wards with an increase in the death-rate are Crouch End from 7.4 in 1912 to 8'7 in 1913, Finsbury Park from 13'4 in 1912 to 14.4 in 1913, and West Hornsey from 9'0 in 1912 to 9.3 in 1913. Finsbury Park has again the highest death-rate for the year, and also the highest for the 9 years shewn on the table. In the Highgate Ward the death-rate has fallen from 10.1 in 1912 to 8.3 in 1913, and in East Hornsey Ward from 11.4 in 1912 to 9'1 in 1913. There have also been smaller improvements in the rates for Muswell Hill, North Haringey and South Haringey.

On the other hand the number of deaths between 1 and 64 years of age is greater by 40 this year as compared with 1912. Nevertheless there is a nett saving of 16 deaths. The following Chart shews the principal causes of death :— 25 CHART SHEWING NUMBER OF DEATHS IN HORNSEY FROM VARIOUS DISEASES. 26 More than half the deaths are due to the diseases classified in the four groups of (1) Bronchitis and Pneumonia, (2) Diseases of the Heart and Blood-vessels, (3) Cancer, (4) Tuberculosis. Of these, the last is of a known infectious nature, and a big step in the compaign against this disease has, been taken now that the various measures provided for by recent legislation have been put into operation, and, in a few years, a considerable saving ought to be shown in this direction. The following diseases caused more deaths in 1913 than in 1912:— Disease No. of Deaths in 1913. No. of Deaths in 1912.

The chief gains are in deaths from Cancer, Apoplexy, and Premature Birth. Tuberculosis.—The deaths from Phthisis of the Lung numbered 55, or 12 more than in the previous year, and 5 more than the yearly average for the preceding 10 years. Seven of these 55 deaths occurred in persons who had been removed to the Edmonton Workhouse, 1 at Clare Hall Sanatorium, 1 at Northern Hospital, Winchmore Hill, and 7 at other places outside the Borough. From forms of Tuberculosis other than Phthisis there were 14 deaths registered, a decrease of 3 compared with the year 1912. The total deaths from all forms of Tuberculosis were, therefore, 69, or 9 more than in the previous year. 28 The number of deaths from Phthisis and from all forms of Tuberculosis and the death-rates per 1,000 of the population are given below.

At the middle years of life, viz.:—15-44 years of age, out of a total of 136 deaths registered for the Borough, 33, or nearly one-fourth, were due to Phthisis alone. The accompanying chart shews the Annual Death-rate from Phthisis in Hornsey for the past 18 years, 1896-1913:— The following table shews the ages at death from Phthisis and from other forms of Tuberculosis :— AGE.

In the first month of the year, therefore, only Pulmonary Tuberculosis was notifiable, under the Regulations of 1908 and 1911. After that date, by the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulation, 1912, the Regulations of 1908 and 1911 were revoked, and compulsory notification was made applicable to all forms of Tuberculosis. During the year 410 cases of Tuberculosis were notified to me by Medical Practitioners. In addition 14 persons were certified to have died from Tuberculosis who had not been notified during life, so that altogether 424 cases of Tuberculosis were registered. Of these it was found that 78 cases had been previously notified and that 100 cases belonged not to Hornsey but to other districts, these notifications being accordingly transferred, the new cases occurring in Hornsey, therefore, being 246. Of these 176 were cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 70 were cases of NonPulmcnary Tuberculosis. The following table shows the number of cases of Tuberculosis notified in each Ward:— Highgate.

The County has been divided for administrative purposes into 5 areas, of which Hornsey forms part of Number 2 area. A Tuberculosis officer has been allocated to this area, and a branch Dispensary has recently been established in Hornsey. The County 33 Council has already provided a large amount of sanatorium accommodation for the patients in the County, and the provision of further accommodation is in hand. An excellent start in the campaign against Tuberculosis has been made by the County, so far as I can judge from the arrangements in our own district, and much is to be hoped from the work now initiated. The part of the Borough Council and its officers in the work of combating Tuberculosis is as follows:—The Medical Officer of Health first receives the notifications of the cases. Enquiries are then made so as to ascertain as far as possible the source of infection and to take such steps as are necessary or desirable to prevent the spread of infection and for removing conditions favourable to infection—the detection and prevention of overcrowding and the removal of insanitary conditions which render houses unfit for human habitation and favour the spread of tuberculosis. Visits were paid to the houses of 187 patients who had been notified as suffering from Tuberculosis. Those suffering from Phthisis numbered 136 of the 176 cases notified, and of the 70 cases of non-pulmonary Phthisis notified 51 were visited. In the remaining cases the doctor in attendance considered that a visit from the Local Authority was undesirable, or in some cases the patient had died, or removed, shortly after notification. In these latter cases visits were made only for the purpose of disinfection. Altogether 134 premises were disinfected in connection with Tuberculosis. History of Infection.—In about half the cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (67 out of 136) it was possible to obtain a history of more or less intimate association with a consumptive, at a time previous to the onset of illness, which makes it possible that this may have been the source of infection. 34 The infecting cases are as follows:— Grandmother 1 Father 8 Mother 7 Sister 8 Brother 13 Son 3 Daughter 2 Husband 9 Wife 1 Other relative 9 Fellow worker 9 ,, lodger 4 67 As is to be expected, where a definite history of exposure to infection can be obtained, it is a member of the same family who is the source of infection. In all but 13 of the 67 cases tabulated the infecting person was a member of the family. Housing conditions in Hornsey are, on the whole, very good, and there was little fault to find in most cases with the living conditions of the patients. It is not probable that these conditions had much influence on the disease. There were 28 premises in which conditions more or less insanitary were found—chiefly want of cleanliness or dampness. In these cases steps were taken to get the insanitary conditions remedied or removed. Of the 187 Tuberculous patients visited, 132 were resident in Hornsey at the time of the apparent onset of the illness. In 16 cases the patients complained that their work-places were not in a satisfactory condition. The complaints referred chiefly to want of light and ventilation. There were 65 patients who at the time of notification were known to have Tubercle bacilli in the sputum, in 65 cases no examination of the sputum had been made, and in the remaining 6 cases no bacilli had been found on examination of the sputum. 35 Occupation.—The occupations of the 187 cases investigated, at the beginning of the illness, were as follows:— Household and domestic work 49 Factories and workshops 25 Clerical and similar sedentary work 36 Shop workers 12 Outdoor manual work 7 School 33 No occupation 25 Predisposing Causes.—Among the conditions which may have been contributory to the onset of tuberculosis were:— Poor physique of the patients in 30 cases Alcoholism ,, 7 „ Careless habits and late hours ,, 3 ,, Poverty and insufficient food ,, 5 ,, In 14 cases there was a local tuberculosis for some period previous to symptoms of lung infection. In many cases there were previous illnesses, which were thought by the patients to have something to do with the onset of the Tuberculosis. These illnesses were as follows:— Pleurisy in 9 cases Bronchitis ,, 13 ,, Pneumonia ,,10 ,, Adenoids ,, 3 ,, Rheumatism ,, 2 ,, and various other illnesses „ 6 ,, In the cases of the Pleurisy and Bronchitis, no doubt what was thought to be an antecedent illness was in many cases the onset of the Tuberculosis. Institutional Treatment.—Of the 136 Phthisical patients visited it was found that 25 had already had institutional treatment in Sanatoria. There were also 40 who had been in Hospitals or Infirmaries and 12 others who had attended Dispensaries for special treatment. Many have subsequently received Sanatorium treatment through the Middlesex County Council or otherwise. 36 Cancer.—There were 96 deaths registered as due to Cancer in 1913, as against 114 deaths from this cause in 1912, and 103 in 1911. This is a decrease of 18 deaths from 1912, and of 7 deaths from the number registered in 1911. A glance at the table below shews that the deaths in 1913, though lower than in 1912. are more than double the number in 1901. The death-rate from cancer per thousand of the population is equal to 1.08, about one-ninth of the total death-rate. Reference to the chart appended shews that previous drops in an otherwise almost continuous rise have occurred, but that these drops have been of a temporary character. There is no reason to believe that any factor has occurred to favourably affect cancer mortality, and the probability is that this year's fall will not be permanent. The following table shews the deaths from Cancer in each Ward of the Borough for the last 13 years and the death-rate from Cancer in the whole Borough for each of these years. Year. Highgate.

The Zymotic death-rate is equal to 45 per thousand of the population. Measles and Whooping Cough are the diseases responsible for the higher Zymotic death-rate this year as compared with 1912. 39 There were no deaths from Scarlet Fever. Not since 1901 have we been entirely free from Scarlet Fever mortality, although the number of deaths from this disease is usually very small. The death-rate calculated per thousand of the population from these diseases is the Zymotic death-rate, and is shewn below in Hornsey and in England and Wales for a number of years:— Horusey.

There were two deaths from this disease in 1902 ; there have been none since that year. From Scarlet Fever there were no deaths. In recent years Scarlet Fever has not been an important cause of mortality, the highest number of deaths in any one year being 6 in 1906. Diphtheria caused 3 deaths, and, with the exception of last year, is the smallest number in any year since 1899. Enteric Fever caused only three deaths, an increase of one as compared with 1912. There were 2 fewer deaths from Diarrhoea. There were 7 more deaths from Measles, 6 from Whooping Cough, 1 from Diphtheria, and 1 from Enteric Fever. Infantile Mortality.—During the year 1913 there were 81 deaths of infants under 1 year of age, as against 105 in 1912, and an average of 113 for each of the ten years 1903-1912. The infantile mortality for the year 1913, i.e., deaths under 1 year of age per 1,000 births, is 56 in Hornsey. In 1912 the infantile mortality rate was 75, and the average rate of the 19 years 1894-1912 was 87, the highest being 133 in 1895, and the lowest 57 in 1909. Thus the infantile mortality is again a very favourable one, and is the lowest on record. 42 WEEKLY RETURN OF INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING 1913.

The number of deaths in the first 3 quarters of the year is almost the same, 22, 21, 22, and then there is a drop to 16 in the last quarter. Often the number of deaths of infants rises rapidly in the 3rd quarter, owing to epidemics of summer diarrhoea. In the hot summer of 1911 there w£re 36 deaths due to this cause. In 1912 only 16 deaths were due to diarrhoea, and in 1913 this number fell to 14. The comparative absence of summer diarrhoea is chiefly responsible for the low infantile mortality of 1913. The accompanying chart shews the Infantile Mortality (deaths under 1 year per 1,000 births) in Hornsey for the past 20 years, 1894-1913:— 44 CHART SHEWING INFANTILE MORTALITY. 45 During 1910 and 1911 there were rises in the Infantile Mortality from what was the low record year of 1909, and these rises were only slightly counterbalanced by the little fall of 1912. This year the Infantile Mortality has iust beaten the previous record. The Infantile Mortality at the four quarterly periods of 1913 was as follows :— 1913. Births. Infantile Deaths. Infantile Mortality. First Quarter 345 22 63 Second ,, 381 21 55 Third 353 22 62 Fourth ,, 346 16 46 The whole year 1,425 81 56 The ages at death were as follows :— Under 1 week 18 1-2 weeks 3 2-3 „ 5 3-4 „ 3 Total under 1 month 29 1-3 months 19 3-6 „ 11 6-9 „ 11 9-12 „ 11 Total deaths under 1 year 81 The saving this year is almost entirely confined to the first month of life, and chiefly to the first week. In 1912 41 infants died in the first week, but this number is reduced to 18 in 1913. After the first month the number of infautile deaths is practically the same as in 1912. The principal causes of death among infants under one year of age were:— 46  Equal to a death-rate per 1,000 births of Premature Birth, Injury at Birth, and Congenital Defects 22 15.4 Bronchitis and Pneumonia 15 10.5 Atrophy, Debility, Marasmus 13 9.1 Diarrhoeal Diseases 10 7.0 Convulsions 5 3.5 Whooping Cough 4 2.8 Overlying 4 2.8 Tuberculosis (other than Phthisis) 2 1.4 Measles 2 1.4 Almost half the Infantile deaths are due to Premature Birth, Congenital defects or Weakness or Injury at Birth, i.e., chiefly to causes which operate at or before birth. Bronchitis and Pneumonia are responsible more than any other condition for the remaining deaths. Diarrhoea caused 10 deaths, and other Infectious diseases 8 deaths. Special efforts are made, by means of house-to-house visitation in the poorer districts, to prevent or mitigate conditions likely to favour the occurrence of diarrhœal diseases, e.g., the proper cleansing of houses, courts and passages, the prevention of accumulations of refuse, and the encouragement of sanitation generally. Plainlyworded leaflets were distributed, giving instructions as to the storing of food, the feeding and management of infants, and the prevention of diarrhoea. Deaths under one year of age of Illegitimate Children.—There were 42 illegitimate births registered during the year, and 7 deaths under 1 year of age of illegitimate children occurred. This gives an infantile mortality among illegitimate children of 166, i.e., more than three times the infantile mortality among children born in wedlock. The number of legitimate births registered was 1,383, and the number of deaths under 1 year of age of legitimate children was 74. This gives an infantile mortality among legitimate children of 53. 47 INFANTILE MORTALITIES IN GREAT TOWNS.

Tuberculosis (all forms) Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1912. For convenience of comparison with preceding years, the following table has been divided so as to show first the total notifications in the case of the older notifiable diseases, and then the more recent additions to the list. Considering the older notifiable diseases first (Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, Erysipelas and Small Pox), we see that the cases notified to me numbered 359 in 1913. This is an increase of 82 as compared with 1912, when 277 cases were notified. The yearly average number of notifications of these diseases for the last 20 years is 458, the number of notifications for 1913 being, therefore, 99 below the yearly average. There were no cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever or Acute Poliomyelitis notified during 1913. The notifications of Tubercular Phthisis numbered 176, and of other forms of Tuberculosis 70, and have already been referred to. 51 NOTIFICATIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

There is therefore an increase of 68 over the cases notified in 1912, and a decrease of 70 on the average number of the preceding twenty years. The disease was mostly of a very mild type, there being no fatal cases occurring among the 206 cases notified.

There is therefore an increase of 27 on the number of cases notified in 1912, and also an increase of 5 as compared with the yearly average for the preceding 20 years. When the increase of population is taken into account the rate per 1,000 of the population is below the average of the last 20 years. There were only 3 deaths among the 115 cases notified, as compared with 2 deaths among 88 cases notified in 1912. 55 The cases were fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, the fourth quarter being highest with 34 cases and the second quarter lowest with 23 cases. The first and third quarters were almost equal with 28 and 30 cases respectively.

Three cases of the 10 notified proved fatal. The number of cases of Enteric Fever in the Borough was one more than in 1912 (10 against 9), but well below the average for recent years. The attack rate is exactly half that of England and Wales. Isolation Hospital.—As compared with the previous year there were 188 more patients admitted in 1913, viz.:—588 in 1913 and 400 in 1912.

Amongst the 367 specimens from patients suspected to be suffering from Diphtheria 40 were taken in the Elementary Schools by the School Medical Officer in connection with outbreaks of Diphtheria in particular classes. There were 1,812 samples of sewage and effluent analysed and reported on. There were also 37 samples of drinking water examined, and in every case the sample was found to be quite satisfactory. Diseases of Animals Acts.—There were 3 outbreaks of Parastic Mange during the year, 11 animals (horses) being affected. One horse was suspected to be suffering from Glanders, but did not react to the Mallein test. Specimens were taken from a dog at Muswell Hill, suspected of Rabies, and submitted to Sir John McFadyean for examination, who reported that the result of his experiments were negative. By the Tuberculosis Order of 1913, made by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, Tuberculosis in cows was made compulsorily notifiable as from the 1st of May, 1913, but no cases have been notified in the Borough. Three licences for the removal of swine from one place to another were granted. 64 The cattle sidings and gangways at the Hornsey Station have been frequently inspected and were found satisfactory. Destruction of Dogs, etc.—83 dogs and 21 cats were brought by their owners to be destroyed in the Lethal Chamber at the Sanitary Depot. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—Richard Robinson, Esq., Chief of the Weights and Measures Staff for the County of Middlesex, has kindly supplied me with the following information as to samples of Foods and Drugs taken by the County Council Inspector in the Borough of Hornsey during the year 1913. No. of Samples taken. No of Samples adulterated.

In a few instances it was found that the necessary notices under the Acts were not exhibited. The shopkeeper's attention was called to this, and on a further visit being made shortly afterwards it was found that the requisite notices were exhibited. The question of Sunday trading was before the Committee, who gave instructions for observations to be made in the Borough on a Sunday to ascertain the number of shops that were open. This was done on Sunday the 5th of October, when 153 shops were found open, most of which were small General Shops, Newsagents, Tobacconists, Sweets or Confectioners' shops. The Committee considered that the result of the observation did not call for any action and the matter was, therefore, allowed to drop. Where it is found that children are being employed at shops, information is given to the Local Education Authority in order that they may see that the provisions of the Employment of Children Act, 1903, are being observed. The following Orders have been made on the petition of the shop-keepers of the particulars trades to which the Orders refer:— "The Hornsey Chemists' Weekly Half-Holiday Order," dated 20th January, 1913, fixing Thursday as the day for the Weekly Half-Holiday. "The Hornsey Dealers in Stationery and Stationers' Sundries Order," dated 19th May, 1913, "The Highgate Ward Dealers in Stationery and Stationers' Sundries Order," dated 31st July, 1913, and "The Hornsey Dealers in Books Order," dated 19th January, 1914, whereby shops to which these orders apply are exempted from the provisions of Section 4 of the Shops Act, 1912, relating to the closing of shops for the Weekly Half-Holiday. 66 Celluloid.—The Secretary of State wrote recommending that the Council should issue a warning to shop-keepers of various trades to take precautions against the dangers arising from the storing of articles made or partly made from celluloid. In accordance with this recommendation leaflets of instructions as to precautions necessary in the manufacture, storage, and use of celluloid and celluloid articles were left by the Inspectors at the shops where celluloid goods were stocked. Water Supply to the Public Elementary Schools.— The Schools all take their supplies from the public water supply and the Schools are visited and samples of drinking water taken every Quarter. These are analysed at the Council's Laboratory. 32 Samples were taken during the year and in each case was found to be satisfactory. Verminous Children.—When the School Medical Officer has ordered any child attending School to be cleansed, the home address of the child is given to the Sanitary Inspector and an inspection is made of the bedding and premises. The parents are advised to have the bedding disinfected, and this is generally agreed to. If the premises are found to require attention the owner is communicated with in respect to any defects or nuisances found. Inspection of Meat and other Foods.—The Inspector of Nuisances and two of the Assistant Inspectors hold the special certificate granted by the Royal Sanitary Institute for the inspection of Meat and other Foods, and the whole of the slaughterhouses and butchers' shops are kept under observation by them. There are nine slaughter-houses and seven seventy two butchers' shops and shops where meat is sold in the Borough. Some slaughter-houses are only used occasionally for slaughtering. Frequent inspections are made of the slaughter-houses during the time of slaughtering and also at other times. Special attention is paid to butchers' shops, fish shops, and greengrocers' premises at the latter part of the week, when the stock is usually largest.
