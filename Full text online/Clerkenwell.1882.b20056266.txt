Pursuant to the 198th Section oe the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Yestry oe the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, beg to present the following Eeport of their proceedings under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and the other Acts which are administered by them, during the year ended on the 25th March, 1883. Rates.—During the year the Eates made by the Vestry were as follows:— For the half-year to Michaelmas, 1882. A Poor Rate of Is. 7(1. in tho £, estimated to realize £24,415 A Sewer ,, 4d. ,, ,, „ 5,140 A Lighting ,, 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1,285 A General „ 10d. „ „ ,, 12,850 2s. 10d. £43,690 For tho half-year to Lady-day, 1883. A Poor Rate of Is. 4d. in the £, estimated to realize £20,640 A Sewer ,, 3d. ,, ,, ,, 3,870 A Lighting „ 2d. ,, „ „ 2,580 A Goneral ,, 9d. ,, ,, „ 11,610 2s. 6d. £38,700 The rates made in April, for the half-year to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £333,047, and those for the half-year to Lady-day, upon a rateable value of £333,313. 4 The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £25,093 in the first, and £22,805 in the second half-year, towards which the Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £3,643 9s. 3d. and £5,689 19s. 9d. in the first and second half-years respectively. The precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the year was for the sum of £8,630 0s. 5d. and that of the School Board of £8,007 10s. 5d. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £6,667 4s. Od. It will thus be seen that of the £82,390 raised during the year, the sum of £61,989 6s. 4d. was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry. s Valuation Lists.—A Supplemental, and four Provisional Valuation Lists have been made out and deposited during the year. They affected some 230 assessments, and produced a net increase in the rateable value of £1,995. Old Toll House Premises, Pentonville Road.— After an unsuccessful attempt to come to terms with the trustees of the Congregational Church adjoining the premises 245 and 247 Pentonville Road, as to their ancient lights, tenders were invited for the premises on building lease for eighty years, and they were let for that period to Mr. George Ell, of Bridge Wharf, bishop's Road, at a rental of £100 per annum for No. 247, from Christmas 1883, and of £22 per annum for No. 245, from Christmas 1882. Mr. Ell is now erecting warehouses and shops upon the site. Gates and Bars across Streets.—In March, 1882, a letter was received from the Secretary of State for 5 the Home Department, asking for a Return of all gates, bars, rails, and posts situate on private property within the Parish, which obstruct the free passage of vehicles in the streets, with the authority under which the right to them is claimed, and the regulations which govern them, and also copy of any correspondence which may have taken place between the Vestry and the owners of, or persons interested in, such gates, bars, rails, and posts, in order that the same might be laid before the House of Commons with the view to the removal of such obstructions. In reply thereto attention was called to the bars in Owen's Row and Owen Street, on the Brewers' Company's Estate; to that in Garnault Place, on the New River Company's Estate; and to that between Woodbridge Street and St. James's Walk, on land lately belonging to the Visiting Justices of the House of Detention, but now under the control of the Prisons' Commissioners, and a copy of the correspondence which has taken place with the County Magistrates, in respect of the latter bar, was forwarded. Tramway Scheme.—The only Tramway Scheme affecting the Parish introduced into Parliament in the Session 1883, was that of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company, renewing their application to extend their system of Tramways along the Clerkenwell and Theobald's Roads. The Company having proposed to pay 12s. per yard for the paving to be taken to by them, to the extent of eighteen inches outside the rails, the Vestry gave their assent to the Scheme, which was, however, thrown out by the House of Commons on the second reading. 6 North Metropolitan Tramway Company.—The following report, with reference to Tramway Scheme in 1871, was laid before the Vestry on the 7th December, 1882:— " Vestry Hall, Cleekenwell, 58, Rosoman Street, E.G. December 7th, 1882. Gentlemen, North Metropolitan Tramways. You will all remember the correspondence which took place some time ago between myself and the above Company, extending over some years, as set forth in the Green Book, printed and circulated by order of the Board in 1881, with reference to a cheque obtained of the Company by me for £1,200, and which I therefore need not recapitulate hero. You will also remember what took place here, at the Committee of Works, and at the Vestry, according to your printed Minutes, when the cheque question was sought to bo made a condition of consent to the then proposed scheme, but which report was rejected by the Board, who preferred to deal with the question then before them upon its merits alone, without reference to anything that had taken place before, and gave their decision accordingly. Notwithstanding the events of the early part of 1880, as recorded in the Green Book, which resulted in the cheque being withdrawn, I never despaired of recovering it by a little judicious management, and kept up the negotiation accordingly. On application being made for consent last year, and a suggestion being made that tho cheque bo made a condition of consent, which I felt to be repugnant to 7 the previous records, the Company wrote me that such a condition, if acceded to, would compromise both sides, and that they therefore could not agree thereto, which I entirely sympathised with. The Vestry, having dealt with the application then before them upon its merits alone, left both myself and the Company free to deal with the other question independently, without compromising either side. I accordingly wrote them pointedly upon the subject on the 15th March last, and have had many interviews with their Solicitor upon the subject, who urged that the Tramway Company, however much they may be disposed to meet the claim we have urged, must have some tangible reason for voting away their Shareholders' money, where there was no legal claim or liability. Now, interpreting the feeling of the Vestry, I furnished them with a tangible excuse by pledging the Vestry to grant a siding in Goswell Road, near Compton Street. These negotiations, although at one time proving very disappointing and disheartening, after so much labour on your behalf, have ultimately resulted in my being invited to meet the Directors and chief Officers of the Tramway Company on the 20th ult., to exchange the £1,200 cheque for Bank of England notes, which I have now the pleasure to lay before you, and to offer for the acceptance of the Vestry. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT PAGET, To the Vestry. Vestry Clerk. And the Bank of England notes for £1,200 were handed over to the Chairman accordingly. 8 Whereupon the Vestry unanimously passed the following resolution:—"That the best thanks of the "Vestry bo given to the Clerk for the constant "assiduity and attention bestowed by him in the matter, "by which so successful a termination of the business " has been come to." The Vestry also unanimously presented the Clerk with £60 out of the sum in question, as an acknowledgment of their appreciation of his services in the matter. The London Street Tramways Company commenced in March last, to lay their tramway along Pentonville Road to King's Cross, authorised in the last Session of Parliament, and the line is now complete. Electric Lighting.—In the last Report it was stated that the Vestry had entered into a contract with the Electric Light and Power Generator Company, (now the Maxim-Weston Electric Company,) to light Pentonville Road with their incandescent lamps for one year for a sum of £167 17s. 6d. Some delay took place in the preparation for the lighting, and it was early in October before the lighting was commenced. During the year the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, was passed. It provides that any local authority, (in the Metropolis, the Vestries and District Boards,) or any Company or private individual may, under certain conditions, obtain a licence from the Board of Trade for the supply of Electricity in any area, for public or private purposes, for a period not exceeding seven years, or a Provisional Order for the same purpose. Under the provisions of the Act notices were given by the Metropolitan Brush Electric Lighting Company, the Gulcher Electric Lighting Company, the 9 Edison Electric Lighting Company, the Pilsen Joel and General Lighting Company, and Messrs. Ferranti, Thompson, and Ince, Limited, of their intention to apply for Provisional Orders to supply Electricity for public and private purposes within the Parish. The Brush Company, however, was the only one which proceeded further in the matter, and the Vestry gave their assent to their application for a Provisional Order, upon certain amendments being accepted by the Company and the Board of Trade. The matter was at this stage at Lady-day, the date to which this Eeport extends. Proposed Outlet from Holford Square into Pentonville Road.—Early in the year 1882, the question of forming an outlet from Holford Square into Pentonville Road was mooted, and letters were addressed to the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, with the view of ascertaining their opinion upon the subject. The replies showed such a large majority against the proposal that it was decided to take no further steps in the matter at present. Colney Hatch Lane, Want of Sewerage.—Considerable inconvenience to the inhabitants of the houses already erected on the Clerkenwell side of Colney Hatch Lane, and a stoppage of further building appearing to have resulted from the want of sewerage in Colney Hatch Lane, the Vestry have been endeavouring, during the year, to provide some remedy for the evil. To this' end an application has been made to the Hornsey Local Board to allow the houses to drain into their sewer in the road, but a reply has been received that they are unable to comply with the request, as the sewer is only sufficiently large to take 10 the drainage of their own side of the road. The Metropolitan Board of Works has also been communicated with, with the view to their providing a system of sewerage for the locality, but no reply has yet been received from them upon the subject. Market, Clerkenwell Green.—In consequence of the suitability of the site, and of a memorial from the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, the Yestry, in September, passed a resolution to allow Clerkenwell Green to be used as a Market on Saturdays, and posters were placarded about the locality, and generally about the Markets of the Metropolis, calling attention to the fact, but hitherto no great success has been achieved. Regulation of Bakehouses.—In September, 1882, a letter was received from the Yestry of St. Pancras, forwarding a copy of a report by their Medical Officer of Health on the subject of the regulation of Bakehouses. The Report called attention to the infrequency of the visits of the Factory Inspector to the Bakehouses in that parish, little more than a third having been visited by him since the passing of the Act in 1878. The Yestry's Medical Officer of Health, accompanied by the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, then made an inspection of the bakehouses in this Parish, with the result that they found that twenty-four, out of a total of sixty, had not been visited by the Factory Inspector at all. A resolution was passed strongly condemnatory of the retrograde character of the legislation which transferred the powers of inspection from the Vestries and District Boards, as the Local Sanitary Authorities, to the Factory Inspectors, and forwarded 11 to the- Home Secretary, and, as a consequence of the action taken by this and other local authorities, a clause has been introduced into a Bill in the present Session of Parliament, (the Factories and Workshops Amendment Bill,) retransfcrring the duties to the Vestrios and District Boards. Chalets.—In the last Report it was stated that permission had been given to the Chalet Company, to erect one of their Chalets on Clerkenwcll Green. In October last, however, a letter was received from the Company, stating that upon reconsideration they are satisfied that it is useless to place a Chalet there, the position not being sufficiently central, but suggesting, as a suitable site, a spot in Clerkenwcll Boad, behind the lamp-post at the corner of Goswell Boad. To this the Vestrv assented, and a Chalet will be erected on J the site. Proposed Mew Street from Gray's Inn Road to the "Angel."—On the 1 5th June, 1882, the Vestry resolved to again memorialize the Metropolitan Board of Works to take steps for the formation of a new Street from Gray's Inn Boad (at the corner of Clerkcnwell Boad) to the "Angel." The Metropolitan Board of "Works therefore prepared a scheme for a street, beginning near the Holborn Town Hall in continuation of Theobald's Boad, and crossing the valley near Mount Pleasant to Exmouth Street, widening Exmouth Street on its south side along its whole length, then passing up Garnault Place, widening Eliza Place between Lloyd's Bow and Sadler's Well's Theatre, and passing into St. John Street Boad at St. John's Terrace. 12 Shortly before the deposit of the plans of the Scheme, however, a member of the Vestry introduced to the notice of the Board on alternative Scheme by which it was proposed to carry the street from the north west corner of Exmouth Street, through John Street, across Tysoe Street and Rosoman Street, past the Roman Catholic Chapel towards the drinking fountain in the New River Wall at the top of Garnault Place, and it was decided to forward the suggestion to the Metropolitan Board of "Works. Upon the communication being placed in the hands of Mr. Thompson, the Member of the Metropolitan Board of Works for Clerkenwell, he consulted the officers of that Board, and was advised that its appearance upon the minutes of that Board would be fatal to the Bill, as showing a disagreement between the Board and the Vestry upon the subject, and he therefore abstained from handing in the communication. Unon o Mr. Thompson reporting his action to the Vestry, a resolution was passed that his conduct had been for the best interests of the Parish, and therefore approving same. The Vestry likewise gave its assent to the measure of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The introducer of the alternative Scheme, however, thought proper to forward to each member of the Metropolitan Board of Works a report of the proceedings of the Vestry in the matter. Opposition was also said to bo threatened by the Marquis of Northampton (possibly for securing a locus standi only) and other land owners, the result being that the Scheme was then abandoned. Paving.—The Vestry considered that, while the London Street Tramways Company was laying its Tramway along Pentonyille Road, a good opportunity 13 was afforded of repaying the sides of the road from Penton Street to King's Cross, which were very much out of repair, and the tender of Mr. J. J. Griffiths, the contractor for the Tramway Company, was accepted, and the work was therefore carried on simultaneously. Berry Street, Hooper Street, and Baker's Row have been laid with some of the old stone. Parliamentary Measures.—In the Session of 1882 the public measures principally affecting the Yestry which became law, were the Electric Lighting Act; the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act, in which a clause was inserted at the instance of the rating authorities of the Country, providing that Bills of Sale shall be no protection against a distress for rates; and the Poor Rate Assessment Act (1869) Amendment Act, limiting the liability of occupiers to the period of their occupation. Of the measures of interest to the Yestry introduced during the present Session the following is a brief summary:— The Bankruptcy Bill.—A Government measure, and of interest chiefly from the fact that, as originally drawn, it proposed to do away with the preferential payment of rates from a bankrupt's estate. The rating authorities of the Country took the matter up, with the result that, not only has a clause similar to that which exists in the present Act, been agreed to by the Grand Committee on Trade, but its operation has been expressly extended to cases of composition, upon which point the present Act has been variously interpreted. [The above received the Royal Assent on the 14th Aug., 1883.] The Infectious Diseases Notification Bill.—Providing for the compulsory notification of cases of infectious disease to the Sanitary authority of a district 14 by the medical man attending the case, and by the parties interested. [The above Bill was dropped]. The Criminal Laiv Amendment Bill.—A Bill principally directed against the offence of procuration, but incidentally dealing with the suppression of brothels, the keeping of which it is proposed to make an offence capable of being dealt with summarily under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. [The above Bill was dropped]. Municipal Government of London.—The Government, at the commencement of the Session, again announced, in the Queen's Speech, their intention of introducing a Bill for the reform of the Government of the Metropolis, and, again, owing to press of other legislation, or other causes, no introduction of such a measure took place. In connection with this subject letters were received from several local authorities of the Metropolis, inviting the appointment of delegates to conferences to consider the subject, and to urge upon the Government the necessity for the continuance of local selfgovernment. These invitations the Vestry declined, expressing the opinion that it is not desirable to take any action until after the introduction of the Bill. The discussion at the Vestry upon the subject gave rise to the following correspondence in the Times and others of the public press, which was laid before the Vestry and approved. " The Ministry and the London Vestries. The Home Secretary has forwarded the following reply to a correspondent:— February 9th, 1883. Dear Sir, I regret that your letter of - the 2nd did not come under my notice till to-day. You are quite right 15 in believing that the Government are most anxious to consider the views and benefit by the experience of those who have been engaged in the useful labours of local administration. I can assure you that personally I shall feel extremely grateful for any assistance of the kind which might be offered to me. I remain, yours faithfully, W. Store, Esq. W. Y. HAECOUET." The following is the letter referred to:— " 3, Lambert Road, Brixton Eise, February 2nd, 1883. Dear Sir, I read in a daily paper the other day that you were giving due weight to information and suggestions received from many quarters in the preparation of the Bill. It was recently reported that a District Board of Works (Fulham) had come to the conclusion that the time had arrived for taking action, not at all in opposition to the proposed change, but really in support of it, by obtaining from those qualified to speak from knowledge and experience an expression of opinion on the most important question of detail involved—viz., the best means of developing the municipal spirit in administrative areas. The idea seemed to be that the Ministry would rather receive such practical suggestions before introducing the Bill than deal with them in the shape of criticisms upon its provisions. Therefore it was determined to issue invitations to a conference. To-day I read that a Yestry (Clerkenwell) has declined the invitation. One reason given for doing so is that the Ministry will not be influenced by, or pay attention to, the opinions or suggestions of any of those who have borne the burden of local administration. My belief is that the Ministry would deem it unfortunate 16 that such an impression should prevail and be acted upon, and that they would only be glad to receive, as early as possible, any statements of fact or conclusions supported by reasons which might be formulated by those most experienced in local administration, and the more so if the representations were made in a friendly and not in a hostile spirit. It is an entirely gratuitous assumption that hostility is to be looked for in this quarter, which is far more likely to prove a stronghold to the Government if the Bill recognises what Mr. J. S. Mill calls "Community of local interest" in some areas less than the whole, as well as in the whole. It would be regretable that support should be alienated by a mistaken conception as to the attitude of the Government towards the men carrying out the Act of 1855, merely because it has become fashionable to use indiscriminate language, and to condemn all who administer the Act, for the shortcomings of the Act itself. I cannot think you would desire that the most legitimate expression of official opinion should be discouraged by the avowal of a belief that the Government would treat it with indifference, particularly as the subject is one that has never been discussed by experts. I therefore take the liberty of calling your attention to the Clerkenwell incident. I remain, &c. WILLIAM STORE." To the Bight Hon. Sir W. Harcourt, M.P., &c. The Vestry Clerk's reply in the daily Press was:— "Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, February 10th, 1883. The Ministry and the London Yestries. Sir, I have just been reading the correspondence between Mr. Storr and the Home Secretary, which appeared in 17 your issue of Saturday under the above heading, upon the proceedings taken at the last meeting of this Vestry on a letter from the Fulham District Board of Works, inviting the Vestry to appoint delegates to a conference to urge upon the Ministry, before the Municipality of London Bill be settled, the necessity of providing for the continuance of local self-government. Mr. Store states that this Yestry declined the invitation on the ground that "the Ministry would not be influenced by, or pay attention to, the opinions or suggestions of any of those who have borne the burden of local administration." Whence Mr. Storr derives his information I am at a loss to know. The reason given by him was certainly not given at this Yestry. The feeling of the Vestry was that it was too late to influence the Government in shaping their measure, seeing that the Conference could hardly meet before the introduction of the Bill into Parliament, and the Yestry therefore passed a resolution to take no action until the Billisbefore them, and they become acquainted with the proposal of the Government. This Yestry are as anxious as any Board can be that full local self-government should be preserved to the local governing bodies of the Metropolis, believing, as they do, in "local men for local affairs," and that any scheme for the future government of London, to be useful and satisfactory, should embody this principle. They feel, and have long felt, that what is wanted is a greater development of this principle—greater power —a greater development of the municipal spirit and status in administrative areas, their duties and functions being analogous to those of provincial municipalities, many of which are not to be compared with the London parishes as regards wealth and population. This Yestry hope, and have reason to believe, from 18 some authoritative utterances, that the new Bill has been drafted somewhat upon these lines, and, if so, I feel very confident in saying that it will be hailed as a real boon to the Metropolis. In any case, I am quite sure this Yestry, so far from being disposed to hold aloof, will be only too ready and willing to join in any movement having for its object the expression of their views upon the subject in question, as long as they can feel that it is not ill-timed or obtrusive; and the invitation thrown out in the Home Secretary's letter for a full expression of the views and experience of those who have been engaged in the local administration will remove any doubt upon this point, and will, doubtless, be heartily welcomed by all concerned. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, EOBEKT PAGET, Veslry Clerk." It was moved by Mr. Brighty, seconded by Mr. Meyer, and resolved unanimously—That the Clerk's letter be approved, and that the correspondence upon the subject be entered upon the Minutes. Mr. Churchwarden Robson then called attention to the following letter, which appeared in the daily papers from Mr. Storr upon the subject. " The Ministry and the London Vestries. Sir, A personal explanation is called for by the letter of Mr. Paget, which is otherwise so admirable an embodiment of the sentiments that may be usefully expressed at the present time, and so complete a justification of my letter to the Home Secretary. The report of the Clerkemvell Vestry meeting, in the recollection of which I wrote, contained (in addition to 19 what is agreed about) these words: " Mr. Brighty said it was clear that the Government would not be influenced by the opinions of the Vestries on the subject. he did not think that a meeting called at Fulham would alter the Government Bill." I did not say this was the reason of the Vestry: I said it was one reason given in support of the course adopted. The other reason—inopportuneness—was involved in dissenting from the opinion of Fulham. The action of that district board in proposing a conference has been vindicated, not only by the Home Secretary's reply, but also by the publication of part of the Ministerial scheme. Its leading feature was indicated long ago by Mr. Gladstone, when he spoke of maintaining and increasing the prestige of the Corporation. All that is new in the latest revelation is that in some way the Yestries are to be used as the basis of local administration; how is not disclosed. This is still a "delicate question" that will "tax ingenuity." Does not this clearly indicate that certain questions are still open ? Mr. Paget states forcibly facts and considerations of great weight in the solution of these questions, and I have no doubt he would render valuable service in the laying down of principles that ought to prevail in maturing the skeleton scheme of the Government. Yours, &c. February 13th. WILLIAM STORK." On the 1st March the Clerk reported the following correspondence:— From the Home Secretary:— " "Whitehall, February 17th, 1883. Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir William Harcourt to request that you will be good enough to furnish me 20 with, two copies of the last annual report of the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, as well as of the reports made by the Medical Officer of Health, tho Sanitary, and other Inspectors (if any), together with statements of the accounts of the Vestry for the same period. Sir William Harcourt also desires to know what has been the amount of the rates in the £ during the year covered by your report for the purposes of the Yestry. And he will esteem it a favour if you will at the same time furnish me with copies of the ratepapers on which the rate has been demanded from the ratepayers. As this information is required by Sir William Harcourt immediately, he will feel much obliged if you can furnish him with tho particulars and papers asked for in the course of the next few days. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, A. F. O. LIDDELL." To the Clerk of tho Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. The Vestry Cleric's reply:— " Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, February 19th, 1883. Sir, Annual Report. In compliance with your request of the 17th inst., received this morning, I herewith enclose two copies of the last Annual Report of this Vestry, being for the year ended Lady-day, 1882, which includes the Annual Report made by the Medical Officer of Health, 21 the Surveyor, the Analyst, and the Inspectors under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, together with the Statement of Accounts of the Vestry for the same period. On the first page of the Report you will find a Statement of the Rates made for the year for the purposes of the Vestry, viz., Sewer, Main Drainage, Lighting, and General, which include the School Board Rate (about 6d. in the £), and also the Rate raised for the Metropolitan Board of Works, of about a like amount. The Poor Rate, although made by the Vestry, is collected and disbursed by the local Guardians or Governors of the Poor under the Local Act, who furnish the Guardians of the Holborn Union with funds for the relief of the Poor, according to precept. I also enclose copies of the ratepapers on which the rates have been demanded, as far as I have been enabled to recover them. Should any more information be required upon the subject I shall be happy to furnish it. Proposed Reform of London Government. Referring to Sir "William Harcourt's published letter of the 9th inst., addressed to Mr. William Storr, in which he appears to invite information on the subject of the work of the Yestries, I had it in contemplation to forward him a copy of a Return of Works and Improvements carried out by this Yestry since its formation in 1856, and the cost of same, which return was made out some time ago, at the instance of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to whom the Annual Reports of the Yestries are required to be furnished in accordance with the Act. 22 These returns were, of course, furnished by the other Vestries and District Boards at the same time, and should give the Home Secretary information which might be useful as to the nature and extent of the work done by the local Boards. As a return was asked for and made out by this Vestry for the years ended March, 1881, in continuation of those made out in 1870 and 1875 (referred to in page 22), I thought it would make the Annual Report more complete and interesting to those concerned, to take the opportunity of annexing the previous returns made, which you will therefore find in detail attached to the Annual Report. I trust I may not bo thought obtrusive in drawing attention to this part of the subject, my only wish being that the Government should be placed in possession of any useful information upon the question. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, EOBEET PAGET, Vestry Cleric." The Hn. Sir A. F. O Liddell, k.c.b., Under Secretary of State, Hme Department. Reply of the Home Secretary:— " Whitehall, 20th February, 1883. Sir, I am directed by tho Secretary of State to acknowledge tho receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, forwarding copies of tho Annual Report, &c., of the 23 Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, and to express to you his thanks for the same. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, R. Paget, Esq., A. F. O. LIDDELL." Clerk to the Vestry of St. James & St. John, Clerkenwell, 58, Eosoman Street, E.C.

The Committee beg to present Their Report, for the year ending on the 25th March last, of the operations and results of the system of doing the Dusting, Slopping, and Watering of the Parish by the Vestry's own staff, as submitted by the Clerk, and approved and adopted by the Committee. 40 Dusting.—During the year there have been 7,509 loads of dust, and 401½ loads of trade refuse removed. 138 freights of ashes and breeze, containing 8,779 chaldrons have been removed from the Wharf, for which a sum of £1,198 4s. 2d. has been received, or an average of £8 13s. 8d. per freight, (against £6 18s. last year). 24 freights of hardcore have also been disposed of, thirteen have been removed free, ten removed at a cost of £11, and £1 was received for one. Slopping.—During the year 3,899 loads of street sweepings were removed from the Parish, 180 of which were collected late on Saturday nights. 84 freights of slop were disposed of, 59 being sold for £57 15s., £1 being paid for the removal of two, and 23 being removed free. Watering.—The Watering was done entirely by the Vestry's staff, no horses being hired for the purpose. Cartage.—The horses and carts have also been employed during the year in carting stone, gully refuse, &c., the cost of which, reckoning the horse, cart, and man at 12/6 per day, would have amounted to £12G 4s. 6d. 41 Horses, Vans, and Carts.—These remained the same as at the 25th March, 1882, viz.: 20 horses, 11 vans, 10 carts, and 12 water vans. Mr. Sharman's Claim.—The Vestry will remember that at the time of the resignation of the late surveyor, Mr. Cox, the question of Mr. Sharman's accounts for the building operations at the "Wharf was placed in the hands of Mr. W. P. Griffith for adjustment on behalf of the Vestry, and that upon his advice the sum of £15 10s. 1d. was tendered to Mr. Sharman in discharge of his claim. Mr. Sharman however claimed £169 17s. l1d. and the matter was referred, by mutual consent, to the arbitration of Mr. F. W. Porter, who sat at the Vestry Hall on the 31st March, 1882, and heard the case. Mr. Porter gave as his award, on the 24th February, 1883, that the Vestry should pay Mr. Sharman £120, and the cost of the award, which amounts were paid accordingly. Adding the balance of Mr. Sharman's account to the expenditure previously incurred, and dividing it over the remaining period of the lease, gives a total depreciation of £424 per annum. The net expenditure for the year ended the 25th March, 1883, will then be shown by the following Account:– 42 Receipts. Expenditure. • £ s. d. £ s. d.

Surveyor's Office, Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, 26th July, 1883. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you my Report upon "Works, &c. executed by your Vestry during the year ending Lady-day, 1883. SEWERS AND GULLIES. A length of 200 feet of 4-ft. by 2-ft. 6-in. and 2-ft. 3-in. brick Sewer was constructed in Cobourg Street. Sixty-eight Sewers were cleansed and repaired and 88 loads of soil removed; three new side entrance covers were fixed, five new gullies were constructed, 246 cleansed and repaired, and 10 were trapped. Two new air grates were fixed. 4 G HOUSE DRAINAGE. The total number of premises drained were 87, the details of which drainage is shewn upon 53 plans prepared for that purpose, and deposited in the Surveyor's Office; these drains consist of 2 12-in., 24 9-in., and 51 6-in. Five old drains were trapped. PAVEMENTS. Carriageways.—The carriageway of Perry Street, Hooper Street, and part of Baker's Row were laid with dressed stone. Footways.—The footways of Hooper Street and Berry Street were relaid, the deficiency being made up with new stone. COLNEY HATCH LANE. That portion of Colney Hatch Lane in the Parish of Clerkenwell between Alexandra Park Road and Friern Barnet was widened.

The width of this portion of Colney Hatch Lane is now 40 feet. JOBBING WORKS. For the maintenance and general repair of the carriage and footways of the Parish the following materials have been used:— 47 Ballast 272 cube yards Hoggin 116 „ Sand 270 „ Shingle 34 „ Broken Granite 442 „ (Of which. 266 cube yards were broken by men engaged by the Vestry) 2 tons of new Granite was laid. 4,120 ft. sup. new York laid.

STREET WATERING. The Street watering was done by the Vestry's own vans, 4,465,000 gallons of water being used, the amount paid for which, including rent of meters, was £248 1s. 1d. URINALS. Complaints having been made of the condition of the Angel Mews urinal, it was taken down and reconstructed on an improved principle, with a separate trap for each compartment. Most of the other urinals also had similar traps placed in them. The urinals at Mount Pleasant, King's Cross Road, St. John Street Road, and Clerkenwell Green were repaired. The whole of the urinals were tarred and painted; and were cleansed twice daily. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM IRON, Surveyor. 49 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For 1883. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I have the honour of laying before you my 27th Annual Report, viz.:— That for the year 1882. The number of deaths arising from all causes in Clerkenwell, during the year 1882, was 12G1. The annual average of the last ten years was 1378, so that the deaths were 117 less than the average. The deaths in 1881 having been 1254, those in 1882 were 7 more than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite :— 50  deaths. births. 1873 1,513 2,664 1874 1,417 2,565 1875 1,539 2,505 1876 1,342 2,559 1877 1,385 2,522 1878 1,303 2,590 1879 1,456 2,667 1880 1,313 2,430 1881 1,254 2,414 1882 1,261 2,420 The births were thus 6 more than in the preceding year, and 113 less than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the births and deaths occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 338 592 254 Amwell 356 679 323 Pentonville 293 510 217 Goswell 274 639 365 In each year, a number of the deaths of the parishioners takes place in general and special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The estimated number of these for 1882 is 105. The number of births having been 2,420, and of deaths 1,261, the excess or the natural increase of population is 1,159. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic dieeases in 1882, was 260, being 20 more than in the preceding year. The number and the causes of the zymotic deaths taking place in Clerkenwell during the last ten years, are exhibited in the subjoined table :— 51  SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLET FEVER. HOOPING COUGH. TYPHUS. DIARRHŒA. TOTALS. 1873 0 48 13 49 29 95 234 1874 2 63 71 38 31 55 260 1875 2 36 76 82 24 58 278 1876 2 48 34 41 12 73 210 1877 15 73 82 36 25 53 284 1878 1 39 41 56 25 73 235 1879 1 74 44 61 11 36 227 1880 2 26 51 87 14 65 245 1881 10 39 54 53 26 58 240 1882 0 61 60 81 18 40 260 The average number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years, was 247; so that the number for 1882 is 13 more than the average. The number of deaths arising from all diseases in infants under 1 year of age, was 367; 1 less than in the preceding year. 167 deaths occurred at and above 60; 38 less than in the preceding year. 110 inquest-deaths acre registered in the year, being 9 less thanin 1881. 52 7 deaths took place in the House of Correction; 7 also in the House cf Detention. 34 deaths arose from violence; the number for 1881 being 41. The numbers for the last five years were 40, 43, 38, 41 and 34, so that the number for this year is 7 below the average. But when it is recollected that these deaths arise from accident, negligence, and suicide, and immediately from fractures and contusions, cuts, burns and scalds (want of fire-guards), overlying and suffocation of infants in bed, children hanging behind vehicles and being run over, it is evident that they are mostly preventable and could be considerably reduced by ordinary care; and it must be remembered that many cases also occur which arc not fatal. Hence the mortality of the year has again been considerably below the average. It amounted to 18 per 1,000; if the persons dying in hospitals, &c., be added, the mortality would amount to 19 per 1,000. In 20 large English towns, the mortality in 1882 was:— London, 21.4; Brighton, 21.7; Portsmouth, 21.5; Norwich, 20.6; Plymouth, 21.2; 13ristol, 19.2; Wolverhampton, 22.4; Birmingham, 20.9; Leicester, 20.1; Nottingham, 23.6; Liverpool, 26.5; Manchester, 26.7; Salford, 23.2; Oldham, 24.6; Bradford, 21.2; Leeds, 23.2; Sheffield, 21.7; Hull, 23.2; Sunderland, 26.5; and Newcastle-on-Tyne, 23.1. The mortality in all London was 21.4; that of the West districts, 19.9; of the North districts, 19.7; of the Central districts, 23.9; of the East districts, 25.3; and of the South districts, 20.7. 53 The mortality of the year 1882, has been less than that during any other year since the existence of the Vestry, save that of 1881. It has been stated that the deaths from the principal zymotic diseases were slightly more numerous than the average. No deaths occurred from Small Pox in the Parish. Five cases came to knowledge during the year. The deaths from Measles were more numerous than in the preceding year; also those from Scarlet Fever to a less extent. The deaths from Hooping Cough were also in excess, while these from Typhus and Typhoid Fevers and Diarrhœa were less than in the preceding year. Of the 60 deaths included under Scarlet Fever, 10 are registered as arising from Diphtheria, 1 of the Fever cases was attributed to Typhus, 14 to Typhoid, and 3 to common continued fever. Slaughter-houses.—These were inspected in the autumn. They were 15; 6 in the upper Wards, 9 in the lower. They were in very good order, the only defects relating to imperfect cementing and paviDg. Cow-houses.—These were inspected at the same time as the slaughter-houses. They were 11 in the Upper Wards, kept by 10 cow-beepers; and 8 in the Lower Wards, kept by 7 cowkeepers. They were found to be generally in a very satisfactory condition. There were 121 cows in the Upper Wards, and 133 in the Lower—254 in all. The cows were fine animals, and in most excellent condition. Bake-houses.—Those in the Lower Wards were inspected in October by the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee and myself; thesein the Upper Wards by myself and the Inspector. I also made inquiries as to the visits paid by the Government Factory Inspector. Sixty bake-houses exist in the Parish: 30 in each group of Wards—the Upper and the Lower. 54 They wore mostly found in good order, some in excellent order; a few, however, were dirty, with the sinks or traps defective. In regard to the visits of the Factory Inspector, some of the bake-houses are stated to have been visited every three months, some nine or ten months, a year, a year and a half, and two years ago; while 24 of the 60 had never been inspected at all. It appears to me that the now Government inspection must be very unsatisfactory to the parishioners, for when the inspection was made by the Vestry, it was made known to the parishioners by the Vestry that the bake-houses wore in a satisfactory condition, and if they were not so, the law was at once applied. But according to the new arrangement, the reports upon their condition are made to what may be called a distant land, and no one in the parish knows anything about their state. Most of the bake-houses which had not been inspected by the Factory Inspector, are situated in the Upper Wards, one in the Lower Wards was inspected for the first time at Easter, this year. I may state, that during my inspection, no "terrible state," with open drains, animals kept therein, untrapped closets, nor beds, as described to exist in the London bake-houses by the Factory Inspector, were met with. No sanitary defects in any bake-house were referred to the Vestry by the Factory Inspector during the year. Mortuary.—During the year, 188 bodies were received at the mortuary, and kept until burial. Of these. 94 were brought for inquest purposes, upon which 48 post-mortems were made; while 94 were brought from houses of the parishioners, whore the corpses would otherwise have remained in living rooms. 55 The Meteorology of the year was as follows:— 1882. Temperature, Average. Difference from average of 41 years. Dew-point. Humidity (Saturation=100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 41 years. Year 49.7 + 0.3 44.7 84 29.75 25.16 + 0.07 Winter Quarter (Jan., Feb., March) 42.7 + 2.9 38.9 87 30.02 3.63 —1.41 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 53.0 + 0.1 46.5 79 29.73 6.13 + 0.30 Summer Quarter (July, Aug., Sept.) 58.1 —2.2 52.1 81 29.70 6.01 —1.41 Autumn Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 44.8 + 0.3 41.2 88 29.56 9.39 + 2.25 Hence the mean temperature of the whole year was slightly above the average; the Winter, Spring, and Autumn quarters being above the average, while the Summer quarter was below. The amount of rain was very slightly above that of the average. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D., Member Royal College of Physicians. May 30th, 1883.

"The Clerk called attention to the fact that since "the Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor Rate, which "duty had reverted to the Guardians or Governors of " the Poor under the Local Act, and which Board had "been revived for the purpose in November, 1871, " there was no Poor Bate Account published, except "the remainder of those in collection by the Vestry "previous to that time, and suggested whether it would "not be desirable, by an agreement between both "Boards, to publish the Poor Rate Account of the "Guardians or Governors, as an appendix to the "Annual Reports of the Vestry. " It was moved, seconded, and "Resolved that such suggestion be approved and "adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes.) ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk.
