EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. 1873-4. Presented pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 & 19 Vict., cap, 120. MEMORANDUM Vestry Poor Rate Account. In some of the previous Reports it has been stated how the collection of the Poor Rate came to devolve upon the Vestry, viz., by the operation of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, and the consequent abolition of the Board of Guardians or Governors of the Poor under the Local Act, in January, 1868. This question having, however, been again raised in 1871, Counsel's opinion was taken thereon, by which it appeared that the operation of the above Act had transferred the Relief of the Poor to the Guardians constituted under the new Poor Law, but had not affected the powers and duties of the former Board as regards the Collection of the Poor Rate. The Vestry therefore, on the making of the next Rate for the Relief of the Poor, in November, 1871, handed over the collection of the same to the local Guardians or Governors, whose meetings (which had ceased since January, 1868,) were revived for the purpose, and who have therefore accounted for the Poor Rate since that time, and will continue to do so in future. Such Poor Rates as were in collection by the Vestry at that time, it was deemed convenient and expedient should be continued by them to the close, hence the annexed account of Poor Rates made previous to November, 1871, which closes the account as far as the Vestry are concerned. ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. For the Poor Rate account by the Guardians or Governors for the year ended Lady-day, 1874, see Appendix A. Vestry of the Parish of St. James & St. John, Clerkenwell.

This Act having passed in August, 1872, the Board, in the following October, proceeded to take into consideration the question of the course to be pursued for giving effect to the Act, by the appointment of an Analyst and other Officers, and the mode of payment of same, &c., and ultimately Resolved to appoint a duly qualified person as an Analyst, at a salary of £100 per annum, without fees, and also an Inspector, and one of the Sanitary Inspectors was appointed accordingly. A communication having been received from the Holborn District Board of Works, suggesting for consideration the question of a joint appointment of an Analyst by the Holborn, St. Giles', and Clerkenwell authorities, the Vestry agreed to join those Boards of Works in such appointment, and after sundry meetings upon the subject between the committees appointed by the several Boards, it was agreed that each Board should offer a salary of £ 100 per annum, it appearing to be more calculated to secure the services of a bigh-class Profe sor, than by each Parish appointing, perhaps, a different gentleman. Advertisements were issued which resulted in the appointment, in March 1873, of Dr. Redwood, Piofessor of Chemistry to the Pharmaceutical Society, 17, Bloomsbury Square, for one year from Lady-day, such appointment being however, separate and distiuct by each Board concerned. After several conferences between the Sanitary Committee of the Vestry and Dr. Redwood, a notice was issued and published in the Parish announcing the appointment, and that arrangements had been made for putting the Act into immediate operation; and a code of regulations was drawn up and adopted for the observance of the Analyst and Inspector in carrying on their operations. A copy of which Notice and Regulations is herewith annexed (see Appendix B.) 8 All necessary Books and Documents having been designed and provided, and other arrangements made, operations were commenced in August, 1873, and Dr. Redwood's and the Inspector's Reports thereon will be found at pages 31 to 37. Paving. During this period the Vestry had under consideration the question of paying sundry streets of the Parish with new Granite sets on Concrete, and of repaying with new such others as required it, and having arrived at the conclusion, after mature consideration, that it was economy to pave streets of much traffic, and to borrow money for the purpose, the repayment to be spread over 20 years, rather than to maintain the streets with MacAdam, they agreed to pave to the extent of some 30,000 yards, at an estimated cost of some £21,000, and to borrow the money for the purpose, and in January, 1874 entered into a Contract for the work (see List of Contracts.) This Contract having been executed subsequently to the period embraced in this Report, the particulars of the Streets paved, with cost, &c., will appear in the following year's Report. These being the chief operations of the Vestry, besides their ordinary proceedings, during the period embraced in the Report, the Reader is referred to the following ordinary Statement of Accounts and Reports for further information therecn.

To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, In accordance with the requirement of the Act, I beg to lay before you my 18th Annual Report, being that for the year 1873. The number of deaths arising from all causes in Clerkenwell during the year 1873, was 1513. The average number of deaths, per annum, during the last 10 years was 1538; hence the deaths were 25 below the average. The number of deaths in 1872 being » 1323, the deaths were 190 more than in the preceding year. 22 The subjoined table exhibits the number of deaths occurring in each of the last 10 years, the number of births for the same years being placed opposite:— Deaths. Births. 1864 1735 2224 1865 1613 2689 1866 1661 2434 1867 1497 2452 1868 1644 2478 1869 1512 2410 1870 1473 2415 1871 1417 2274 1872 1323 2353 1873 1513 2664 The births were 225 more than the average. The sub-districts in which the deaths and births occurred, were as follows:— Deaths. Births. Excess. St. James 539 848 309 Amwell 341 606 265 Pentonville 282 518 236 Goswell 351 692 341 Each year a certain number of the deaths of the parishioners takes place in general and special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums, situated in other parishes. The estimated number of these for 1873 is 110. The number of births being 2664, and the deaths 1513, the excess, or the natural increase of the population, amounted to 1151. The number of deaths which arose from all the zymotic diseases in 1873, was 279; that for the preceding year being 305; hence there was a diminution of 26. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1873 was 234; being a diminution of 40 from that of the preceding year. 23 The numbers and causes of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases during the last 10 years are shown in the subjoined table:— Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Typhus. Diarrhœa. Total. 1864 7 73 94 71 87 46 378 1865 12 27 57 88 84 48 316 1866 6 42 59 95 93 47 342 1867 20 44 49 35 71 50 269 1868 4 58 106 69 112 45 394 1869 0 28 116 81 74 44 343 1870 6 63 122 19 70 40 320 1871 60 23 33 62 68 33 279 1872 15 35 20 105 76 23 274 1873 0 48 13 49 29 95 234 The average number of deaths from these principal zymotic diseases, during the last 10 years, was 314; so that the number for 1873 is 80 below the average. The number of deaths from all causes, in infants and children under 5 years of age, was 739; being 8 in excess of the number for the preceding year. The deaths at and above 60, were 285; including 42 at and above 80. The numbers for the preceding year were 200 and 25. 344 deaths arose from pulmonary diseases; the number for 1872 being 243 ; hence an increase of 101. 112 deaths occurred in the Workhouse, 64 of males, and 48 of females. The numbers for the preceding 10 years having been 158, 167, 174, 156, 186, 178, 140, 107, 75 and 38. 24 27 deaths took place in the House of Correction; and 1 in the House of Detention. The accidental deaths were 39, the number for 1872 having been 30. 15 of these arose from fractures and contusions; 1 from a wound; 3 from burns; and 20 from suffocation in infants. 2 deaths arose from murder. 2 deaths originated in suicide, viz.: I from a wound, and 1 from poison. The Table appended to this Report, contains an enumeration of the deaths, according to the diseases and ages, in further detail. Hence the mortality of the year 1873 was below that of the average of the last 10 years; but above that of the preceding year. The mortality amounted to 23 per 1000; whereas in 1872, it was 20 per 1000. Including the number of deaths of persons dying in Hospitals, &c., as determined by calculation, the mortality would be 24 per 1000. In 21 large towns of the United Kingdom, the mortality per 1000 was determined by the Registrar-General to amount, for 1873, to:—average total 24.4; London, 22.5; Poitsmouth, 18.4; Norwich, 21.5; Bristol, 23.1; Wolverhampton, 25.1; Birmingham, 24.9; Leicester, 24.4; Nottingham, 23.2; Liverpool, 25.9; Manchester, 30.1; Salford, 29.3; Oldham, 25.8; Bradford, 24.7; Leeds, 27.6; Sheffield, 25.8; Hull, 23.9; Sunderland, 22.8; Newcastle, 30.1; Edinburgh, 22.0; Glasgow, 29; and Dublin, 25.7. Although the mortality of Clerkenwell in 1873 was above that of the Metropolis generally, it was still below that of the entire Central Districts, in which it amounted to 25.0 per 1000. By comparing the groups of diseases in the Table appended to my last Report, for 1872, with that of the present Report, we can trace the source of the total increase of mortality, as well as the groups which give rise to it.

The occupation of the new Compton Buildings, and the Brewers' Buildings, has undoubtedly produced some increase of population. On comparing the Tables, it will be seen that the mortality from all the zymotic diseases has declined considerably ; as has that also from the principal of these diseases. As these diseases are such as are most subject to the influence of sanitary measures, the excess of mortality cannot be attributed to sanitary deficiencies. We have no deaths to record from Small Pox—thanks to vaccination. I believe the Act to be well carried out in this parish. 29 deaths arose from Fever—2 being described as from Typhus, 18 from Typhoid, and 9 as from simple continued Fever. A considerable increase will be noticed in the deaths under the 6th group—Scrofula, &c. This must be attributed to bad domestic management: improper infant feeding, too close confinement indoors, and other causes producing general constitutional debility. The 9th group—Pulmonary diseases, show a great increase. This may be attributed to the coldness of the Spring Quarter of the year. Some increase will be noticed in other groups of diseases ; but it will be observed that these are not at all amenable to the sanitary laws, which it is the duty of the Vestry to administer. Thus to atrophy and debility of infants, 94 deaths are attributed, the number for 1872 being 74. These arise mostly from want of * breast-milk, and impioper feeding; the mothers having injured their health by over confinement at sedentary occupations. Slaughter-Houses.—The Slaughter-Houses were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself, twice during the year; the first inspection being in July, and the second in October, prior to the licensing day. They were 30 kept by 30 butchers. In 1872, the numbers were 33 and 32. The sanitary improvements ordered by the Committee were duly carried out. 30 Cow-Houses.—These were also visited twice in the year, at the same time as the Slaughter-Houses. They were 27, kept by 25 cowkeepers, the number of Cows being 402. In 1872, the numbers were 31, 28, and 329. The Meteorology of the year was as follows:— 1873. Temperature, Average. Difference from Average of 102 years. Dew-point. Humidity ( Saturation =100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from Arerage of 58 years. Year 48.9 + 0.4 43.5 82 29.78 23.5 —0.6 Winter Quarter (Jan. Feb. Mar.) 39.4 + 0.8 35.6 86 29.70 5.7 + 0.2 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 51.8 —0.5 44.9 78 29.80 4.7 —1.0 Summer Quarter (July, Aug. Sept.) 60.3 + 0.6 52.8 77 29.78 7.6 0.0 Autumn Quarter (Oct. Nov. Dec.) 44.2 + 0.5 40.7 88 29.83 5.5 —1.6 Hence the mean temperature of the whole year was slightly above the average; while that of the spring quarter was below the average, that of the summer, autumn, and winter quarters was above the same.

At a Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 18th December, 1873. "The Clerk called attention to the fact that since the "Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor Rate, which duty had "reverted to the Guardians or Governors of the Poor under "the Local Act, and which Board had been revived for the "purpose in November, 1871, there was no Poor Rate "Account published, except the remainder of those in "collection by the Vestry previous to that time, and suggested "whether it would not be desirable, by an agreement between "both Boards, to publish the Poor Rate Account of the "Guardians or Governors as an Appendix to the Annual "Reports of tho Vestry, in which case there would be one "and-a-half years' Poor Rate Account to be appended to "the Report about to be issued for the year ended Lady"day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by Mr. Dore, " and— "Resolved that such suggestion be approved and "adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes.) ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk.
