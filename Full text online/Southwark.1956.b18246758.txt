The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for the year 1956. As will be seen from the various statistical tables in the body of the report, the year was comparatively speaking a healthy one. Apart from the Dysentery epidemic, which commenced at the end of last year and slowly faded away by late Summer, there were no major epidemics of infectious diseases. It will be noted that the population figure as estimated by the Registrar General has again fallen by as much as 1,500 persons to 92,300. This downward swing has been continuous since the Census in 1951, but I believe it has about reached bottom and that there will be a reversal to an upward swing in the next year or two when the many cleared sites in the Borough are re-developed and new flats and houses become occupied. The Crude death rate of 12.9 remains more or less stationary, but the adjusted death rate of 11.6 compares favourably with the rate of the country as a whole, namely 11.7. Two-thirds of the 1,196 deaths, occurred in the 65 and over age groups, the principal causes being diseases of the heart and blood vessels. On the other hand, one quarter occurred in the middle age groups 45-64, the principal causes again being diseases of the circulatory system, closely followed by Cancer, the chief organs affected being the lungs. Looking to the bright side of the statistics, we find that the Infant Mortality rate of 16 per 1,000 live births creates a new record for the Borough and compares well with the 23.8 rate for the country as a whole. Furthermore, unlike any previous year, not a single illegitimate baby died. It is highly satisfactory to record that not a single mother lost her life as a result of childbirth. Towards the end of the year, I followed up the 41 paralytic Polio cases which occurred in 1955: I was able to trace 37 of them, four having left the district. Of the 37, 14 had completely recovered and five had some slight muscular weakness remaining but were well and attending school. The remaining 18 had some paralysis left either in arms or legs. Many of them were at Queen Mary's Hospital, Carshalton, whilst a few were attending local hospitals wearing irons and receiving physiotherapy. ii The work of the Old People's Welfare Committee again shows further expansion in every branch of their activities. Meals-onWheels served to the home-bound increased to 27,537. 20,460 meals were served in the Gate House Restaurant; 6,131 at the Nelson Square Club and 1,548 at Lady Margaret Club—a total of 55,676 meals. Towards the end of the year, Miss Morris, our first organising Secretary, was appointed to a similar position in the Borough of Stepney, and we unfortunately lost her valuable services. Our thanks are due to Miss Morris for her untiring efforts in building up this service for old people from the very difficult time of its inception to its present state of popularity and efficiency. In December, the Committee were fortunate in obtaining the services of Miss Doris M. Beer to replace Miss Morris. Miss Beer comes to us from the County Borough of East Ham, where she is a Welfare Officer and has a wide experience in the welfare of the aged: she commences her duties in Southwark on 1st January, 1957. Some important legislation was passed during the year, including the Clean Air Act, 1956, and the new Food and Drugs Act and the Food Hygiene Regulations. These two Acts and sets of Regulations are designed that in due course we shall be able to breathe clean air and eat clean food prepared and served in a cleanly manner. My best thanks are due to various members of the Council and Chief Officers for the consideration they always give me, and to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ever willing help and co-operation. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, W. STOTT. Medical Officer of Health. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at 31st December, 1956). Mayor—D. C. LOW, J.P. Chairman—J. J. SHEEN. Aldermen—A. E.

There was a slight increase in the birth rate. The death rate fell after last year's increase. The infant death rate is the lowest recorded; the legitimate infant rate and the still birth rate were the lowest since 1950. Whilst there was little change in the illegitimate birth rate, it is gratifying to record that there were no illegitimate infant deaths during the year.

Lloyd) There was a slight increase during the year in the number of schoolchildren treated for head and body vermin due to the fact that children from Bermondsey schools are now sent to this centre, in addition to those from Southwark and Lambeth Schools. There has been, however, a very considerable reduction in the numbers of both male and female occupants of Common Lodging Houses and Hostels who have received treatment during the year. This is a welcome indication that the incidence of louse infestation amongst homeless people is now comparatively slight. The heaviest individual infestations of body vermin noted, have occurred with some old people living alone in one or two rooms. Infestations of premises with the usual type of domestic pests, i.e., bed bugs and fleas, have again shown a considerable reduction during the year, although infestations of other types of insects have again increased. This department has been called upon to deal with a number of wood boring beetle infestations, some of which have been found to be dispersed throughout the ground floors of premises. Other infestations dealt with included Beetles, Ants, Silver fish, Clover Mites and flies of various species. In one block of flats a particularly heavy infestation of "Blow flies" ("Blue Bottles"— Calliphora vomitoria) resulted when the death of a lone occupant of one flat was not discovered until a period of some six weeks had elapsed. Commercial premises dealt with have included a heavy infestation of " Crickets " in a factory, Common Cockroaches (Blatta orientalis) in a number of bakeries and German Cockroaches (Blattela germanica) in a cafe. A considerable amount of disinfection has been carried out during the year—not only in domestic premises. During the Dysentery epidemic of the early part of the year, all schools where there had been a number of notified cases of Dysentery were disinfected. A hospital situated in the Borough requested help in reducing an infection passing through one of its wards. The wards and annexes were disinfected with "Formalin" and the contents were removed for steam disinfection. During the early part of the year, a considerable strain was placed on the resources of the Centre in dealing with the extremely heavy notifications of Dysentery. In a period of less than five months over 700 notifications were received. On notification of infectious disease the home conditions are investigated, details of the case and contacts noted, arrangements made for the collection 10 of bacteriological specimens and disinfection that may be necessary, schools notified and details of how the disease is spread and precautions to be taken, are given to the family. An increasing number of aged and infirm people of both sexes in need of bathing, are collected from their homes in our transport, bathed and returned home. Although it is often difficult to persuade some to agree to accept this service, it has been found that once the initial reluctance is overcome, they are generally very willing to attend on subsequent occasions. nfectious Disease Gases : Enquiries and Visits.

The quarterly treatment had been advocated locally and from the results so far obtained, it seemed that the treatment had been most successful. More than a half of the 1,018 manholes on the sewerage system have given "No takes" and at the time of the last treatment, only in three cases was the poison bait completely taken. Ten per cent, zinc phosphide poison bait has been used and was checked some 48 hours afterwards. This method has reduced to a minimum the cost of sewer treatment. A very vigorous policy has been maintained in connection with the location of defective drainage, in order to ensure satisfactory repair. Dealing with the drains and sewers simultaneously has no doubt been responsible for the reduction by 14 per cent, in the number of complaints received in the Department. VENTILATION OF SEWERS To assist the ventilation of the sewerage system, the caps have been removed from the rodding eyes of the interceptors of the drainage of certain premises under the control of the Local Authority and in order to prevent rats gaining access to the drainage systems from the sewers, wire mesh was substituted for the removed caps. It is understood that there has been an improvement in the ventilation of the sewers as a result of this action, but it is too early to come to a conclusion as to whether the procedure already adopted in respect of certain Local Authorities' premises could be advocated as a general principle. In any case, the caps should not be removed from any drainage system until the Local Authority is satisfied that the drains are in a satisfactory condition and would not provide egress for rats which would eventually infest the premises. HOUSING REPAIRS & RENTS ACT, 1954 191 certificates of disrepair and 40 revocation certificates were issued during the year under the above Act. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 During the year three samples were taken and submitted to the prescribed Analyst Mr. G. Ginger, F.C.S., Chiltern Research Laboratories, Ltd., Marlow. All these samples complied with the requirements of the Regulations. Nine premises are registered for the use of filling materials, and one licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. 18 WELL WATER The three private wells in the Borough are still in use for industrial purposes. The supply in each case is satisfactory. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS In accordance with Section 18 of the L.C.C. (General Powers) Act, 1954, relating to hairdressers and barbers' establishments, fourteen such premises were registered during the year, making a total of 65. PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS Under the Sanitary Inspectors (Change of Designation) Act, 1956, Sanitary Inspectors are henceforth designated as Public Health Inspectors. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936—REPAIRS The Public Health Committee in October authorised legal proceedings to be instituted for the recovery of the cost of repairs undertaken by the Council in default of owners in accordance with the provisions of Section 286 (6)(a) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In certain cases where the owners were unknown, proceedings were also authorised, pursuant to Section 289 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, for the recovery, if necessary, of the costs of work from the occupiers of the premises. VACANT SITES A comprehensive survey was made during the year of all sites in the Borough, with particular regard to their general state, nuisances requiring action, sealing off of disused drains from demolished properties, and rat infestation. LIGHTING OF STAIRCASES As long ago as 1946 this Council drew the attention of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to the lack of powers requiring owners of tenement buildings to provide artificial lighting on common staircases; these powers were formerly contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1927, which was repealed by the Public Health (London) Act of 1936, as it was thought that the Housing Act of that year would enable byelaws to be made for this purpose. In 1955 the Council again raised the matter with the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, and as a result of their representations the London County Council inserted a clause in their General Powers (No. 2) Bill, reviving the powers of the 1927 Act. The draft clause, however, contained certain weaknesses, and after a number of discussions with officers of the London County 19 Council suitable amendments were made. In its final form, the clause empowered Borough Councils to serve a notice on an owner (or, in certain circumstances, an occupier) requiring him to provide adequate means for the artificial lighting of a common staircase in a house let in lodgings or occupied by more than one family, or in a building occupied as two or more separate dwellings. In default of the owner, the work could be carried out by the Borough Council. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government drew attention to the fact that Parliament had recently passed local Acts giving the local authorities concerned powers to make bye-laws dealing with the artificial lighting of common staircases, and accordingly it was agreed that such a clause should be included in the County Council's Bill in substitution for that proposed. It was, however, feared that model bye-laws would not enable borough councils to carry out the work in default of owners, and that for this reason the bye-law making power was an inadequate substitution for the clause as finally submitted to the House. The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee were accordingly informed that additional powers were considered to be necessary. PLEASURE FAIR Careful investigations were made into arrangements for a pleasure fair to be held on a vacant site for three weeks in November and December. The sanitary arrangements were satisfactory, and no Public Health nuisance was caused. NUISANCE FROM FACTORY Complaints of a nuisance arising from a local factory have been received intermittently from local residents during the last four years. In spite of modifications carried out to the plant the complaints are justified and the conditions are a contravention of Section 147 (2)(c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, which deals with " any trade or business which occasions any noxious or offensive effluvia, or otherwise annoys the neighbourhood or inhabitants, without using the best practicable means for preventing or counteracting the effluvia or annoyance." The factory management have made every effort to collect the dust produced in their factory, but as they have received notice from the London County Council to vacate these premises under a Town Planning Scheme, and all the arrangements regarding compensation, etc., were concluded, they claim that it is difficult, in the circumstances, for them to undertake large-scale alterations to this factory. The matter was discussed with the London County Council, but as the freeholder will not accept a properly negotiated purchase price, the London County Council is having to take compulsory powers. The County Council were requested to expedite the removal of this factory in order to end this nuisance. 20 DISPOSAL AND STORAGE OF REFUSE Following complaints from the dust collecting teams, through their Union, of the difficulties and unpleasantness involved in making collections where the disposal of refuse was carried out by means of dust chutes a detailed inspection was made by the Public Health Inspectors of the blocks of dwellings where dust chutes are in operation. The majority of these flats are of the old type and the methods of refuse disposal have remained unaltered throughout the years. From the discussions with the owners, it was evident that the chief objection to any scheme of modernisation or bettering existing methods of refuse disposal on the premises was the expense involved in structural alterations and difficulties in finding suitable places for the storage and emptying of dust bins or Paladin containers at the blocks of flats. Nevertheless, a number of owners co-operated readily and some schemes of reconstruction are under consideration. The conditions of some basement ashpits are deplorable and major alterations would involve costly structural alterations and the necessity of some rehousing, but the matter is being kept under close supervision. CLEANSING OF TENEMENT HOUSES The attention of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee was drawn to the fact that borough councils now have no power to require the regular periodical cleansing of rooms, etc., in tenement houses. Formerly it had been possible, under a bye-law made by the London County Council, to require owners to remedy defects in such dwellings which could not properly be included in nuisance notices under Public Health legislation. This power was repealed by Section II of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 (which empowers local authorities to require works to be carried out in houses let in lodgings to render the premises reasonably suitable for occupation by more than one family), but it was considered that the present powers are not sufficient to enable local authorities to require periodical cleansing of rooms, etc. The Medical Advisory Body of the Standing Joint Committee were of the opinion that power on the lines of the old bye-law would in fact require a higher standard of maintenance for the rooms of houses let in lodgings than for the rooms of a house in single occupation (which does not appear to be justified), and that the main difficulty in London is to obtain the cleansing of common staircases and other parts of buildings (for example, lavatories) which are used in common. Additional powers which should be limited to such parts of a building would have to be obtained by means of a clause in a London County Council (General Powers) Bill. It was pointed out that the suggestion refers to tenement houses (that is houses let in lodgings) and not tenement buildings such as are mainly found in this borough. The suggested powers would, 21 however, be useful in special cases, and the Standing Joint Committee were informed that additional powers are necessary, and should be limited to parts of buildings common in use. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 This Act received Royal Assent on 5th July, 1956, and certain sections came into operation on the 31st December, 1956. Its main objects are to prohibit the emission of dark smoke from chimneys, railway engines and vessels; to prohibit the installation of new industrial furnaces unless they are reasonably capable of being operated without emitting smoke; to require that the emission of grit from furnaces shall be minimised; and to empower Local Authorities to declare smoke control areas in which smoke emission from chimneys shall be an offence. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION (Smoke Abatement Officer—Mr. G. Stubbs.) The figures of deposited matter in the industrial area of the Borough showed a general improvement. This trend has been consistent over the past few years and probably is largely due to the restricted use of the old Bankside Generating Station. It is noted, however, that the figures of deposits recorded at Walworth Road, which is mainly a residential area, have shown a slight increase, principally during the winter months. The sulphur dioxide figures, both from the lead peroxide instruments and the daily volumetric apparatus, have shown a higher average than the previous year, and it is difficult to give an adequate reason for this increase especially in view of the reduced domestic coal consumption in the Borough. During the year, several complaints were received of smoke emissions from works' incinerators burning waste products. Visits by the Inspector resulted in the installation of one new incinerator and two others being repaired. It is often found that primitive equipment and methods are used for the burning of wastes and rubbish. Many of the smoke emissions from factory chimneys were found to be due to excessive demands on the boilers or to mechanical faults or to new personnel. In all cases the management concerned took action to abate the nuisance. One furnace which had been converted to oil burning had to return to coal because of the oil shortage, and the change over caused some smoke at the time. On several occasions advice has been sought of the Department as to the most suitable type of heating appliance and fuel. Two talks on " Air Pollution and what the Council is Doing " have been given, and our exhibition models have been loaned to other Boroughs. The Council has in use two Standard Deposit Gauges, three Lead Peroxide Instruments and one Smoke and Volumetric SulphurDioxide Apparatus. 22 Sulphur Dioxide (Lead Peroxide Method) (mgm S03/sq. cm./day) Mean Daily Concentration of Sulphur Dioxide parts per 100 million Smoke mgms/m3 Walworth Road St. George's Bankside Walworth Road January 5.81 3.73 6.01 22.0 1.17 February 6.06 3.97 6.07 17.7 0.65 March 4.52 — 4.57 18.6 0.62 April 4.20 2.81 3.83 - - May 2.41 1.54 2.48 4.3* 0.12* June 1.35 0.98 1.61 2.3 0.19 July 1.74 1.01 2.00 2.8 0.13 August 1.99 1.16 2.35 3.1 0.09 September 2.66 1.63 3.20 5.2 0.16 October 3.92 2.36 4.10 8.9 0.38 November 5.4 3.5 6.4 13.7 0.54 December 5.1 3.2 5.3 27.7 0.52 ♦Observations 14th-31st May Deposited matter at following sites :— 1956 Bankside Walworth Road Greenmore Wharf Bankside Jetty (Recorded by Borough Council) (Recorded by Central Electricity Authority) Tons per square mile January 43.1 37.7 36.8 24.7 February 21.9 8.4 18.3 9.3 March 25.3 28.8 43.7 19.5 April 26.3 25.4 26.6 15.9 May 14.3 13.7 — 28.7 June 24.6 16.6 33.1 9.7 July 31.2 18.3 31.3 14.3 August 34.0 26.6 22.1 4.7 September 21.8 16.4 32.2 17.0 October 20.8 25.9 18.7 13.9 November 16.2 18.8 22.6 15.9 December 30.0 25.0 33.0 17.6 During the year, 14 complaints were received regarding smoke emissions: 242 observations and inspections were made by the Inspector, and 11 Intimation Notices issued. The Council supported representations made by Islington Borough Council against the proposal of the London Transport Executive to replace trolley buses with diesel engined buses. It was contended that the resulting increase in exhaust fumes may constitute a serious danger to health in the light of recent enquiries into lung cancer. 23 FACTORIES ACTS Five hundred and thirty-nine inspections of Factories were made during the year, and 21 notices were served. There are now 1,052 factories of all types on the register, comprising 253 factories without mechanical power, 746 with mechanical power, and in addition 53 building sites, for which a further 156 inspections were made, but no notices served.

Most of the dealers sold only pre-packed ice-cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. During the year 32 samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results :— 24 samples, Grade I. 3 samples, Grade II. 4 samples, Grade III. 1 sample, Grade IV. In addition : 18 samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition of ice-cream. One of those samples did not contain the requisite amount of fat and the vendor was cautioned. Samples subsequently taken at the premises were satisfactory. Periodical inspections were made to all premises. Copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III 32 and IV samples, special investigations were made at the premises in an effort to detect some fault which may have caused the unsatisfactory gradings. DESIGNATED MILK During the year the following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. 130 Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 144 Dealers' Licences for Sterilised Milk. 108 Dealers' Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Supplementary Licences 18 Supplementary Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 19 Supplementary Licences for Sterilised Milk. 18 Supplementary Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Thirty-two samples of Designated Milks were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. All these satisfied the prescribed tests. Thirty-five samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council informed of the results. MILK SELLERS At the close of the year there were 154 registered milk distributors in the Borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the Borough from registered premises elsewhere was 20. 317 inspections of Milkshops and Dairies were made during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS Five samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis under the above regulations. They were all certified by the Public Analyst to comply with the said regulations. BAKEHOUSES At the end of the year there were 21 Bakehouses in use in Southwark, of which 3 were Basement Bakehouses. Seventy-four inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors. A basement Bakehouse at 119, Walworth Road, was closed by the occupier. 33 SLAUGHTERHOUSES There are now no slaughterhouses in the Borough. CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 420 catering establishments in the Borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens. All have received systematic inspection and close supervision during the year, and a satisfactory standard has been maintained. REGISTRATION OF FOOD PREMISES (Food and Drugs Act, 1955) There are now 85 premises (a decrease of 6) registered for the purpose of the Preparation or Manufacture of Sausages or Potted, Pressed, Pickled or Preserved Food intended for Sale.

The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee were asked to make representations to the Minister that in calculating the meat content of sausages regard should be had only to the amount of trimmed meat. The General Purposes Sub-Committee of the Standing Joint Committee were, however, unable to recommend this action, following a report from the Advisory Body of Medical Officers of Health that if the meat content were based on lean meat only the proportion of "filler" material might be increased at the expense of fat, resulting in a very inferior product. COFFEE EXTRACT Arising from an advertisement and a report by the Public Analyst that an informal sample consisted of a dry Coffee extract and was therefore incorrectly described as 100 per cent. Pure Coffee, the manufacturer gave an undertaking to modify the label suitably. EGG PRODUCTS During the year considerable attention has been given to the examination of imported egg products. Two chambers were specially constructed for the heat treatment of egg albumen as a result of collaboration with the trade, and the method of heat treatment proved to be most successful. FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS 1955 Extensive steps were taken to ensure that the provisions of the new Food Hygiene Regulations (the main part of which became operative on 1st January) were made known to food traders. Over 1,200 booklets were sent out to catering establishments, food shops, etc., with explanatory letters offering the assistance or advice of the Public Health Department. From 1st July all stalls selling open food for immediate consumption are required to have an adequate supply of clean hot water available. These requirements were also carefully notified to all stall holders. The utmost co-operation has been evident from the great majority of food traders of every description in the Borough, and the general standard of hygiene has improved. 35 FOOD SHOPS Public houses 165 Cafes 143 Factory canteens 112 Butchers 47 Fish shops (wet and dry) and fried fish shops 59 Bakehouses 21 Greengrocers 222 Grocers 158 Ice cream dealers and manufacturers 260 Schools providing food 50 Milk distributors 154 FOOD SAMPLING During the year under review, 508 samples and 847 informal samples were submitted to the Public Analyst.
