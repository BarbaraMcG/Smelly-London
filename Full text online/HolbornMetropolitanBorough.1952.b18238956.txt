Holborn 6191 Voluntary Hospital. 56 Ambulance Facilities. The London County Council, as Local Health Authority, is responsible under Section 27 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, for the provision of ambulance facilities within the Administrative County of London. The Home Service Ambulance Department (Order of St. John of Jerusalem and British Red Cross Society) and the Hospital Car Service act as agents of the County Council in supplying some of the ambulance and car transport provided under the Act. The Headquarters of the London Ambulance Service are at The County Hall, Westminster Bridge, S.E.1. Ambulances may be summoned as follows:— (1) Accidents— Sudden illness in the streets, public places or places of employment. (Note—For sudden illness in the home a doctor, not an ambulance, should be summoned. Dial "999" (or follow the instructions given on the telephone instrument) and ask for— "AMBULANCE." (2) Maternity patients (who have booked a bed in a hospital or maternity home)— Very urgent illness in the home (provided a medical practitioner certifies that the case is one of life or death and arrangements have been made with a hospital for the patient's admission). Telephone— WATerloo 6000 CENtral 6301 REGent 4000 RELiance 3622 or NEW Cross 2645, 10 (3) Illness, infectious disease, etc.— Normally the hospital to which the patient is to be admitted will summon the ambulance, if one is necessary, by telephoning WATerloo 3311. This applies also to patients being discharged from hospital or attending there as out-patients. Emergency Bed Service. (King Edward's Hospital Fund for London). The Emergency Bed Service was founded in 1938 to assist general practitioners in finding beds for acute emergency cases. Since the 5th July, 1948, the Service, working in close co-operation with the Ambulance Service, has acted as agent for the four Metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards for the admission of all types of cases except mental and tuberculous. Since the 3rd October, 1939, the Central Office of the Emergency Bed Service at Old Jewry (MONarch 3000) has dealt with cases from the Central London area only, from 8.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily (including Sundays), branch offices having been established to deal with the outer part of Greater London. At night a full service is available at the Central Office for the whole of Greater London. 11 SECTION 2. Births and Deaths. STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1952. Population.

The numbers of either males or females who have died of pulmonary tuberculosis have not shewn any uniform trend during these last seven years. The numbers of deaths from malignant neoplasm of the lung or bronchus are of interest in view of trends shewn by national figures. The Table does however show the higher incidence in men for both diseases, and that these neoplasms produce a wastage of life practically equal to that of pulmonary tuberculosis. 17 SECTION 3.

Recent Legislation. The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1952. These Regulations, which came into operation on the 1st May, 1952, revoke the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930. The new Regulations, while continuing to require notifications of tuberculosis to be sent to local medical officers of health, have modified the provisions in relation to the keeping of records of notifications so as to place upon County Councils and County Borough Councils the predominant responsibility for the prevention of tuberculosis. Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1953. These Regulations, which came into operation on the 1st April, 1953, revoke the Infectious Diseases (London) Regulations, 1927. The new Regulations continue the effect of the revoked Regulations in that notification is still required of malaria, dysentery, acute primary pneumonia and acute influenzal pneumonia. Action is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of enteric, relapsing and typhus fever. The chief modification is that precautionary measures which previously applied to typhoid and paratyphoid fevers and to dysentery, apply to other salmonella infections, and to staphylococcal infections likely to cause food poisoning. During the year 261 cases of infectious disease were notified, of which 39 were removed to hospital. These are tabulated in the age groups (see Table No. 6, page 20). Comparative figures of infectious disease for the years 1922-1952, are also shown (see Table No. 7, pages 22 and 23. Diphtheria. It is very gratifying to report that for the second year in succession no case of diphtheria was notified. Graph No. 3, facing this page, shows a comparison between the incidence of diphtheria and the number of persons immunised against diphtheria during the years 1920 to 1952. Dysentery. Nine cases were notified and seven were removed to hospital. GRAPH No. 3. DIPHTHERIA, 1920-1952. [To face page 18. Persons Immunised. Cases Notified. 19 Erysipelas. Two cases were notified and one was removed to hospital. Food Poisoning. One case due to salmonella typhi-murium was notified and was removed to hospital. Malaria. One case of a secondary relapse was notified and was removed to hospital. The patient was an airman stationed in the Borough. Measles. One hundred and thirty-three cases were notified, and ten were removed to hospital. Two cases removed to hospital were subsequently re-diagnosed, one as gastro-enteritis and the other as German measles. Pneumonia (Acute Primary and Acute Influenzal). Four cases were notified, and three were removed to hospital. Puerperal Pyrexia. One case was notified during the year, and was removed to hospital. Scabies. Three cases were notified, all of which were treated at home. Scarlet Fever. Eighteen cases were notified, and eleven of them were removed to hospital. Three cases removed to hospital were subsequently re-diagnosed as catarrhal pharyngitis, coryza and German measles respectively. Smallpox. In February three persons arrived by air from Kano in Nigeria, where a case of smallpox had occurred, and were kept under observation for a period of 16 days. In November a ship arrived at Tilbury, having had a case of suspected smallpox during the voyage from Sydney. Ten passengers presumed to be contacts were kept under observation until information was received that the case was not one of smallpox. Tuberculosis. See page 51. Whooping Cough.

Accumulations of refuse removed 15 Overcrowding abated 1 Animals kept in a proper manner 1 Other defects remedied 28 Complaints. During the year 723 complaints were received in respect of the following nuisances:— Aged and infirm persons 1 Animals improperly kept 3 Artificial lighting, absence of, on common staircase 1 Dampness 61 Dilapidations and disrepair 40 Drains, choked or defective 12 Dust 4 Dustbin accommodation inadequate or unsuitable 4 Flues, defective 15 Food premises, unsatisfactory conditions in 14 Noise 5 Overcrowding 9 Obnoxious smells 72 Refuse, accumulations of 32 Rodent infestation 287 Roofs, defective 21 Smoke 9 Unsound food 11 Ventilation inadequate 4 Vermin 109 Water, supply impure 2 Water, supply inadequate 4 W.C. accommodation inadequate, dirty or defective 34 Miscellaneous 56 28 Water. 1. Water for drinking and commercial purposes in this area is supplied by the Metro- politan. Water Board and has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality. 2. There is a piped supply, and bacteriological examinations of the raw water are made by the Metropolitan Water Board, who also perform chemical analysis. 3. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. 4. No action has been necessary in respect of contamination. 5. All dwelling houses have a piped supply, and standpipes are normally used only in cases of emergency, such as repair of mains. Two complaints were received regarding the unsatisfactory condition of the water supplied for drinking purposes. In one case the Metropolitan Water Board collected a sample, and on analysis the water proved to be satisfactory. In the second case it was found that the supply was not from a rising main and that the tank cover was unsatisfactory. A main water supply was provided and the tank cover was repaired. Drainage. During the year 3,192 inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in connection with drainage work; 96 applications for approval of proposed drainage work were submitted together with the necessary plans, and 93 Combined Drainage Orders were made. Smoke Abatement. During the year 9 complaints were received regarding smoke nuisances and 202 observations were made. In most cases, it was found that the nuisance was caused by unsatisfactory stoking, and conditions were remedied following advice being given by the District Sanitary Inspectors. In one case it was found necessary to serve a Notice under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Bombed Sites. Accumulations of refuse on bombed sites present a considerable problem to local authorities. In very few cases are the accumulations such as to warrant the service of notice in respect of a " nuisance and there is also the difficulty of assessing responsibility for the accumulations. In 1949 the Council made a by-law governing fly tipping on vacant sites in the Borough, but considerable difficulty is experienced in tracing offenders. Sites cleared by Council, e.g., bedding removed 30 Sites cleared as a result of the service of notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 5 War-Time Reservoirs for Emergency Water Supplies. The war-time reservoirs for emergency water supplies were kept under observation throughout the summer months, with a view to the prevention of nuisance, and in particular to prevent the breeding of insects. Where necessary, arrangements were made for accumulations of water to be pumped out by the London Fire Brigade. It is pleasing to note that with the increase in rebuilding some of these potential sources of nuisance have disappeared. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act, the Poisons Rules, 1952, and the Poisons List Order, 1952, regulate the sale of poisons, and every local authority is required to keep a list of persons who are entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. During the year 1952, 36 applications were received for retention on this Council's list. One application was received for entry on the list. 29 The Poisons List Order, 1952, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1953, adds certain substances to the Poisons List and revises the names of certain substances already on the list to accord with current usage. The Poisons Rules, 1952, which came into operation with the Poisons List Order, 1952, makes appropriate provision for the substances newly added to the Poisons List by the Poisons List Order, 1952. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act and the Regulations of 1951, require the registration of premises where specified filling materials are used in connection with certain upholstering and filling processes, and require premises used for the manufacture or storage of rag flock to be licensed. Five premises in the Borough are registered under the Act, but no premises are licensed for the manufacture or storage of rag flock. Housing Acts, 1936 and 1949. The following is a summary of action under the above Acts during the year 1952. Slum Clearance. Houses included in clearance areas Nil „ „ ,, „ „ and demolished Nil „ repaired as a result of action under Sees. 9 and 10 Nil „ made the subject of demolition orders Nil „ demolished as a result of demolition orders Nil Parts of buildings made the subject of closing orders 1 „ „ „ closed by undertaking Nil Underground rooms made the subject of closing orders 2 „ „ closed by undertaking Nil Closing orders determined 1 No. of flats erected by the Council during the year Nil Note: The number of underground rooms which do not comply with the relevant Regulations, but which are occupied for human habitation is 488. Houses Let in Lodgings. Number in Borough 300 Inspections made 470 Notices served 2 Complaints remedied under the By-Laws 20 Overcrowding. On the 1st Jaunary, 1952, 180 families were known to be living in overcrowded conditions. During the year a further 14 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions.

Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. This Act lays a duty upon a local authority to see that their district is kept free from rats and mice. It empowers them to carry out inspections and to require owners and occupiers to keep their land and premises free from infestation. Occupiers are required to give notification in writing of infestation by rats or mice to the local authority. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Report for Year ended 31st December, 1952. The following particulars were supplied to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in accordance with Article 1 (c) of the Conditions of Exchequer Grants to Local Authorities dated 28th July, 1950:— Type of Property.

As a result, it was found possible to dispense with the services of one of the rodent operatives, and subsequent survey work is being carried out not as a block scheme, but as and when normal complaint work permits. Complaints. Apart from the Block Control Scheme, 371 complaints of rat or mice infestation were received and investigated during 1952. The following figures show the work carried out during the year arising from the complaints received:— Business premises inspected 205 Dwelling houses inspected 221 Local authority premises inspected 3 Business premises treated 159 Dwelling houses treated 192 Local authority premises treated 3 Treatment visits 2,987 Other visits 73 Estimated kill (rattus norvegicus) 43 Bodies recovered (rattus norvegicus) 15 Estimated kill (rattus rattus) 1,210 Bodies recovered (rattus rattus) 360 Estimated kill (mice) 1,402 Bodies recovered (mice) 416 General.

No rodent repression work in sewers was carried out during the year by the Council owing to experiments in sewer maintenance treatments which were undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Infestation Control Division. The treatments have been carried out at three-monthly intervals since October, 1951, and have consisted of direct poison baiting using 1% by weight sodium monofluoroacetate in damp sausage rusk. The Ministry have kindly supplied the following summary of the results obtained:— Treatment dates. No. of sites baited. No. of sites at which poison was eaten. % of sites at which poison was eaten.

The National Assistance Acts, 1948 and 1951, provide that, where certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be necessary for the purpose of securing the proper care and attention for persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention, a local authority may apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for an order to sccure the removal of such aged and infirm persons. There were no cases arising during the year which called for action under the above Acts by the Public Health Department, but visits were made in connection with the voluntary removal of aged and infirm persons living alone, to hospitals or other places and in connection with the provision for such persons of home nursing and home help facilities. Burial of the Dead. Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, places upon the Borough Council the responsibility of causing to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died in the area, or been found dead in the area, in any case where it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body are otherwise likely to be made. Such cases are those of persons who die in poor circumstances, and, with few exceptions, have no known relatives. Hospital Management Committees and Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals have been asked by the Minister to exercise their powers to arrange and pay for the burial or cremation of such persons dying in hospital. This Circular does not apply to voluntary hospitals, of which there are two in the Borough, namely the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and the Italian Hospital, Queen Square. During the year ten cases were dealt with, at a total cost of £110. 4s. 6d., of which £92. 15s. 7d. was recovered, leaving a net cost to the Council of £17. 8s. 11d.

Previously the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1951, provided that until an order was made by the Minister of Health the maximum rate of interest should be 2½%. 37 SECTION 5. Factories. Most of the provisions of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, are administered by the Ministry of Labour and National Service through H.M. Factory Inspectors. The Sanitary Authority is charged with the duty of enforcing the legislation as to sanitary accommodation in all factories in its area, and, in those factories where mechanical power is not used, legislation with regard to cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, and drainage of floors. All factories must have an adequate supply of drinking water from a public main or some other source approved in writing by the Council. Particulars of inspections and other work carried out during 1952 are as follows:— Number of visits to:— Factories with mechanical power 273 Factories without mechanical power 79 Outworkers' rooms 17 Electrical stations and sites of building operations 54 Notices served:— Factories Acts. 1937 & 1948.

The Milk and Dairies Regulations require every Local Authority to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises which are used as dairies. "Dairy" does not include a shop from which milk is supplied only in the properly closed and unopened vessels in which it is delivered to the shop, or 42 other place in which milk is sold for consumption on the premises only. "Distributor" includes a purveyor of milk whether by wholesale or retail. Most distributors now sell milk in the bottles and cartons in which they receive it from the wholesaler, and consequently their premises are not required to be registered as dairies. Dairies registered during 1952 Nil Dairies on register at end of 1952 3 Distributors registered during 1952 6 Distributors removed from register during 1952 5 Distributors on register at end of 1952 68 Number of above distributors trading from premises outside Borough 27 Inspections made by Inspectors during 1952 19 Formal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 176 Informal milk samples taken and submitted for analysis 3 During 1952, 176 formal and 3 informal samples of milk were taken. Four samples were found to be adulterated. Legal proceedings were instituted in three cases (for details see page 35) and in the remaining case a letter of caution was sent to the vendor. The following table shows the monthly variation of the chemical composition of the 179 samples. Month. Number of Samples examined. Total Solids Per cent. average. Solids Non-fat Per cent. average.

A person proposing to use a special designation authorised by the Regulations is required to apply to the licensing authority of the area in which the milk is to be sold, for a licence to use the designation. Upon being satisfied that the relevant provisions of the Regulations are complied with, a Licensing Authority grant a dealer's licence to a distributor in respect of each of his premises within their area rrom which the designated milk is to be sold. Where a distributor holding a dealer's licence to use a special designation in respect of milk sold from premises in one area, wishes to sell milk within the area of another Licensing Authority, the latter authority may issue a dealer's supplementary licence authorising the use of the designation in their area. During the year 164 licences were issued, details of which are as follows:— Dealer's Licences. Dealer's Supplementary Licences. To sell Tuberculin Tested milk 23 22 To sell Accredited milk — 1 To sell Pasteurised milk 43 25 To sell Sterilised milk 26 24 Milk — Bacteriological Examination.

Premises used for the manufacture, storage or sale of ice cream are required by Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, to be registered by the local authority. On the 1st January, 1952, one set of premises was registered for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream, in Holborn, and 73 premises were registered for storage and sale. During the year ten applications were received and approved in respect of premises to be used for storage and sale. One set of premises ceased to be used for the storage and sale of ice cream, and was removed from the register. At the end of the year, there was one registration for manufacture, storage and sale, and 82 premises were registered for storage and sale. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, Etc.) Regulations, 1947. During the year 14 samples of ice cream were submitted for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The results in the grading suggested by the Ministry of Health were as follows:— Grade 1 2 Grade 2 6 Grade 3 2 Grade 4 1 Two coloured ices and an iced lollie did not respond to the test. These samples were examined for the presence of faecal coli, which in one case were found to be present, and in the other two cases absent, in 1 ml. of the sample. In the case of samples falling within Grades 3 and 4, letters were sent to the vendors drawing their attention to the poor grading. In such cases where the ice cream was manufactured outside Holborn, details were also sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas concerned. The results of all examinations of their own products were forwarded to the large manufacturers for their information. Licensed Premises. There are 77 public houses in the Borough, and during the year 96 inspections and 109 re-inspections were carried out. Two notices were served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and six notices were served under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. In addition, 45 reports were submitted to the Licensing Justices, in respect of premises where application had been made for the grant, re-grant or transfer of a licence under the Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910, 45 Food Sampling.

The Holborn Clean Food Guild, which was formed in January, 1950, had another successful year during 1952. During the year a further nine applications were received for membership, and at the end of the year the Guild had a membership of 77, 15 of whom had been approved during 1952. There remained 27 applicants in varying stages of progress towards the necessary standard required for registration, and some of these have been registered during the current year. Renewal of membership was requested from all the sixty-two members eligible for re-election during the year, indicating their appreciation of the work of the Guild in connection with their business. In each case the necessary standard was found to be maintained, and the renewal of membership was granted. Recent Legislation. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Amendment Regulations, 1952. The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947 to 1951, prescribe certain requirements to be observed in the manufacture of ice cream intended for sale for human consumption and in particular require the mixture to be subjected to one of two methods of heat treatment. The new Regulations which came into operation on the 5th May, 1952, provide for a third method of heat treatment as an alternative to the two existing methods. The three methods now are: Method I. The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 150° Fahrenheit for 30 minutes. Method II. The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 160° Fahrenheit for 10 minutes. Method III. The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 175° Fahrenheit for 15 seconds. Food Standards (Ice Cream) (Amendment) Order, 1952. This Order amends the Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951. As from the 7th July, 1952, the date upon which the new Order came into operation, the minimum quantity of fat and milk solids other than milk fat required to be contained in ice cream was reduced. (A further amendment has since been made and as from 1st June, 1953, a former standard has been restored, namely—not less than 5 per cent. fat, 10 per cent. sugar and 1¼ per cent. milk solids other than fat). Public Health (Meat) (Amendment) Regulations, 1952. The Regulations which came into operation on the 31st August, 1952, amend the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, so as to extend to horses, asses and mules the application of Part II, which relates to slaughter houses and the slaughter of cattle, swine, sheep and goats and, among other things, requires prior notice of slaughter to be given to the local authority. Transfer of Functions (Slaughterhouses and Knackers' Yards) Order, 1952. This Order, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1953, transfers to the Minister of Food certain statutory powers and duties relating to slaughterhouses and knackers' yards, and the slaughter of animals. 51 SECTION 7.

The campaign for the early detection of Tuberculosis was continued during the year by Mass X-Ray Unit II of the North-West Regional Hospital Board. Facilities were afforded to persons living or working in Holborn for X-ray examination of the chest during May and June, 1952. A large number of firms in the Borough were invited to allow their employees to undergo examination by the Unit, and the managements proved very co-operative. The total number of volunteers from Holborn examined was larger than on any previous occasion. The following are particulars giving the results of the examinations:— Analysis of Survey of Persons Living or Working in the Borough. Men. Women. Total.
