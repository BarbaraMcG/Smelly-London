ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Fourteenth Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Borough of Bermondsey during the year, 1914. The death-rate was 17·6, compared with 17·98 in 1913 and 16·9 in 1912, which was the only occasion in which it was lower than the year under report. The section of the report are, as usual, divided into : — I. —Vital Statistics. II.—Notification of Infectious Diseases. III.- Sanitary Administration. IV.—Factories and Workshops. In the Appendix will be found the Local Government Board Tables, including a special Table on Infantile Mortality. On the outbreak of war four of the clerical staff, three of the disinfecting staff and three convenience attendants joined the army and this has naturally interfered a good deal with the activity of the department. The posts have been filled temporarily, but however willing, new hands cannot altogether replace the old ones and the work has not proceeded quite so smoothly as prior to the war, but matters are being gradually improved. It has been found especially difficult to, replace the clerical staff, so that I must ask the indulgence of the Council and other public bodies as well as readers of my reports if the imperfections are a little more prominent than usual. Considerable delay has occurred in the printing owing to the firm which does the work being engaged on urgent work for the Government. Again, I may record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordiality and co-operation throughout the year. Thanks are also due to the members of the staff for their hearty co-operation in carrying out the various duties devolving on the Public Health Department. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R. KING BROWN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS Population. The populations of the Borough of Bermondsey and its registration sub-districts, as enumerated in the Census of 1901 and 1911, and the estimate of the year under report, are as follows : — Estimated to 1901. 1911. June 30th,1914. Bermondsey 82,483 81,959 81,781 Rotherhithe 38,460 35 ,247 34,134 St. Olave 9,817 8,697 8,298 Borough 130,760 125,903 124,213 As the Census is taken in April, it is usual to calculate the various rates on the mean population, which is assumed to be that existing at the end of June or the middle of the year under report. To arrive at this it is therefore necessary to estimate for a further three months, which in Bermondsey is assumed to be a decrease. The decrease is partly due to the increased facilities of transit, leading to a tendency on the part of the population of this, as well as other central boroughs, to seek residence further out. This is an object to be desired, since it is beneficial alike to those going and those remaining, for only in this way can sufficient space be provided round houses and overcrowding on large areas be avoided. If the demand for slum property ceased it would soon lead to its abolition. Another cause of decrease is the replacement of small house property by factories and warehouses as soon as the leases fall in. This cause is slow but steady and will gradually displace the population towards the periphery of the metropolis. Births. The total number of births registered in the Borough for the 52 weeks ended January 2nd, 1915, was 3,757, consisting of 1,909 males and 1,848 females. This is 262 below the average for the last 10 years, and 85 below the figure for 1913. This total includes 2,502 for Bermondsey, being 46 below that for 1913, and 174 below the average tor the last 10 years ; 1,032 for Rotherhithe, being 51 below the number for 1913, and 62 below the average for the last 10 years ; and 232 for St. Olave, being 12 above the number for 1913, and 25 below the average for the last 10 years. In Table II. of the Appendix will be seen the figures for the last 10 years in the three registration sub-districts, and in Table I. figures for the whole Borough. The birth-rate for 1914, was 30·2 per thousand persons living, which is o-6 below that for 1913 and 1·3 below the average for the last 10 years. Particulars of rates will be found in annexed I able A. London is included for comparison. A new departure with regard to births was made by the Registrar-General in 1906. The births are corrected by distributing those which occurred in the chief lying-in hospitals of the Metropolis to the Boroughs in which the mothers had resided previous to admission. Those allocated to Bermondsey in 1914 number 35 and if they are added to the above total the rate would be 30·5. TABLE A—BIRTH-RATES. Year. London Whole Borough. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe.

Marriages. The total number of marriages in the Borough in 1914 was 1,236, being 33 above the number for 1913, and 112 above the average for the last 10 years. The increase in the marriage rate co-incident with the decrease in the birth-rate is an undesirable sign and much to be regretted. In Table VIII. of the Appendix will be found particulars of numbers and rates in the three Registration Sub-districts. The numbers have been supplied by the Superintendent Registrar. Deaths. In Table IV. of Appendix will be found the Local Government Board tables dealing with deaths in the Borough. The extended table of causes of death initiated in 1904 will also be found in the Appendix. The total number of deaths registered in the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1914, was 1,694, which is 36 less than in 1913, and 168 less than the average for the last 10 years. When this figure is corrected by exclusion of deaths of nonparishioners occurring in the district, and the inclusion of deaths of parishioners occurring outside the district, the number is raised to 2,184. This is 59 less than in 1913, and 176 less than the average for the last 10 years. The annexed table shows the distribution of deaths in quarters, together with the corresponding quarters of 1913. The largest number of deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year. TABLE B.—DEATHS. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. St. Olave. Whole Borough.

If the Census population be taken as the basis of calculation of the rate, it works out at 17·3, which is 0·5 below that for 1913. TABLE C.—DEATH RATES. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. Whole Borough.

Bronchitis, whooping cough, diarrhoea and enteritis and tubercular diseases are chiefly accountable for the decrease. In column I, foot of Table I. of the Appendix, will be found a list of places where deaths of non-parishioners occurred in the district. There were 26 such deaths in all, against 21 in 1913, and 20 in 1912. 9 such deaths occurred in the infirmary ; 9 in River Thames; 6 in Surrey Commercial Docks ; I in the street ; and I in a private house. 516 persons belonging to this Borough died in outlying institutions, against 534 in 1913, and 538 in 1912. The names of the various places where the deaths occurred will be found in columns 2 and 3 at foot of Table I. of Appendix.

" The age and sex distribution of the population of England and Wales being taken as a standard to all communities within their borders, the death-rates of different localities can be calculated on the assumption that they have the same proportion of children under 5, old people, and women as have the population of England and Wales. By thus eliminating this disturbing factor of age and sex distribution different communities can be brought into strict comparison with one another. " In 1883 the Registrar-General commenced a method of correcting the death-rates of the great towns of England and Wales. Taking account of the differences of age and sex distribution between these and the latter, he has calculated a factor for each great town by which the recorded death-rate must be multiplied so as to allow for the differences of age and sex, and thus places them as regards these matters on an equal footing. You thus get death-rates the difference in which we can put down to general sanitary conditions alone. In illustration of this I have taken the above figures from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary for 1912 to form Table E. " It will be seen from this that in London and the Boroughs the correction raises the death-rate, showing that there is in them a preponderance of people living at ages when the death-rate is low (viz., between 5 and 50), and also of women, sufficient to keep the recorded death-rate down, notwithstanding the great number of children under 5."

This gives a zymotic death-rate of 2-II. The total number of deaths from notifiable diseases, viz., scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhus fever and enteric fever, was 28, compared with 23 in 1913, and for the non-notifiable, viz., measles, whooping cough and diarrhoea, 234 compared with 297 in the previous year. Senile Mortality. The number of deaths over 65 years of age in 1914 was 500, compared with 504 in 1913. Death Certification. There were no uncertified deaths in 1914. Small-pox. There were no deaths from this cause in 1914. Measles. There were 79 deaths due to this disease, which is 23 below the average for the last ten years, and 9 below the number for 1913. The deaths occurred in quarters as follows, viz.:—14, 24, 26,15. Diarrhoea. Table H shows the connection between the meteorological conditions and deaths from this disease. The most important factor in the prevention of diarrhoea is undoubtedly breast-feeding. If young children are breast-fed and given reasonable care, their chances of life are four or five times, and according to some authorities ten times, as great as children artificially fed, even when this is done under favourable conditions, 17 TABLE H.

The deaths occurred in quarters as follows: —1, 9, 1, 3. Typhus Fever No deaths occurred from this disease, Enteric Fever. 2 deaths were due to this cause, both in Bermondsey. The corresponding figures for 1913 were 2 for the Borough, viz., both in Rotherhithe. Tubercular Diseases. The number of deaths from all forms of tubercular disease in 1914 was 262, against 277 in 1913. This figure comprises 173 for Bermondsey, 66 for Rotherhithe, and 23 for St. Olave. Of these, 196 were due to phthisis and 66 to the other tubercular diseases. B Phthisis. In Table J will be found particulars of deaths from phthisis since the year 1904. There were 203 deaths due to this cause, which is 2 more than the number recorded in the previous year. TABLE J.-PHTHISIS. Sub- District Bermondsey. Rotherhitlie St. Olave. Whole Borough London.

The remarks made then will therefore apply. This is part of the steady fall which is taking place all over the country in this disease. There are two causes at work to produce this —first the immunity which is being acquired owing to the gradual elimination of unhealthy stocks, and second the various sanitary measures which have been recently put in force. How much is due to each it is impossible to say. Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver. 19 deaths were attributed to this cause in 1914 against 26 in 1913. This number gives a very small idea of the deaths caused by these diseases, since they are often the remote causes of death, and are not always mentioned on the certificate for various reasons. Cancer. 138 deaths were attributed to this cause. The Cancel Research Commission have not yet issued their final report on the subject. Heart Diseases. 188 deaths were due to this cause, which number is 10 above that for the previous year. This refers to organic or vavular disease of the heart. Suicides. 15 persons committed suicide in 1914 by poison, 2 by asphyxia, 4 by hanging or strangulation, 1 by drowning, and 4 by cutting or piercing instruments. Accidents. 88 deaths were due to accidents, against 78 in the previous year. Particulars will be found in the extended table of the Causes of Death in the Appendix. Other Violent Causes. There was 1 death by homicide during the year under report. B 2 19 II.-NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. In Table 111. of Appendix will be found particulars of infectious diseases notified during the year under report. The number of cases notified, exclusive of notifications of tuberculosis, which numbered 544, was 950, compared with 1,193 in 1913 and 896 in 1912. All the diseases show a decrease on the number for the previous year, with the exception of erysipelas and cerebro-spinal meningitis,; the former is the same as last year and the latter shows an increase of 2. The number of cases notified in the registration sub-districts was 641 in Bermondsey, against 800 in 1913, 261 in Rotherhithe, against 339, and 48 in St. Olave, against 54 in 1913. The attack-rate per thousand inhabitants was 7·6, the rate for the sub-districts being 7·8 for Bermondsey, 7·7 for Rotherhithe, and 5·8 for St. Olave. The corresponding rates in the previous year were 9·6 for the Borough, 9·8 for Bermondsey, 9·8 for Rotherhithe, and 6·2 for St. Olave. 44 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from the disease for which they were notified, but if allowance is made for mild unreported cases, the recorded notifications would, if anything, understate the actual number of cases. Small-pox. No cases were notified during the year under report. Typhus Fever. No cases of typhus fever were notified daring the year under report. Diphtheria. There were 214 cases of diphtheria notified in 1914, of which 138 occurred in Bermondsey, 67 in Rotherhithe, and 9 in St. Olave. This is a decrease on 1913, for which the figures were:— Borough, 245 ; Bermondsey, 164 ; Rotherhithe, 68 ; and St. Olave, 13. From the following table it will be seen that an increase has taken place throughout London. Cases of Diphtheria Notified. London. Bermondsey.

The case mortality was 7·9 per cent., against 6·5 per cent in 1913 and 8·1 per cent, in 1912. 15 cases were returned as not suffering from this disease. 327 specimens were sent in by medical practitioners for bacteriological examination, against 250 in 1913 and 223 in 1912. Of these 72 were found to contain diphtheria bacilli, all of which were notified. In 1 case of diphtheria the source of infection was attributed to a previous case in the family. The following appeared in the report last year and gives an explanation of the method adopted in this Borough to prevent the spread of this disease. Diphtheria is a disease caused by a characteristic bacillus known as the Klebs-Loffler Bacillus, which occurs in the throats of persons attacked by the disease. It seems to be conveyed from person to person by direct contact, and there is no virulent disease which will spread more rapidly under certain circumstances than this will among school children. It is more or less directly conveyed from throat to throat by children passing sweets, slate pencils, and other articles which they are liable to put in their mouths, from one child to another. Kissing an affected person on the mouth will also frequently give rise to the disease, and an infected child coughing in the neighbourhood of non-infected ones will also often transmit the disease to them. Sometimes the bacilli will exist in the throat for a long time without producing any symptoms, but such children, while not suffering themselves, will be liable to convey the infection to others. For this reason they have been called "carrier" cases, and, as expressed in previous reports, my belief is that a large part of the spread of the disease is due to such cases. Since 1902 an endeavour has been made in this Borough to prevent any of these " carrier " cases returning to school, and each Annual Report has contained some account of the working of the plan. This consists in getting the parents of a child which is notified as suffering from diphtheria to bring up the other members of the family within a week or so after the removal or recovery of the case to the municipal laboratory at the Town Hall for examination. If diphtheria bacilli are found in the throats they are excluded from school for a fortnight, and if then found to be free, are allowed to return to school. The number of children thus examined in 1914 was 333, belonging to 173 families. Out of this number 18 had diphtheria bacilli in their throats or noses, 4 of whom developed the clinical symptoms of diphtheria, and were therefore notified. Scarlet Fever. The notifications of scarlet fever in 1914 were 568. Of these 389 occurred in Bermondsey, 150 in Rotherhithe, and 29 in St. Olave. This is a decrease of 164 for the Borough on the total for 1913. The distribution of the disease in the various Wards, as shown in Table 111. of Appendix, was fairly uniform. SCARLET FEVER Notifications 1914 marked Red. A v era ge 10 years 1304-1913 marked Green DIPHTHERIA. Notifications 1914 marked Red. Average 10 years 1904-1913 marked Green. ENTERIC FEVER. Notifications 1314 marked Red. Average 10 years 1904-1313 marked Green. 27 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from scarlet fever. The accompanying chart shows the prevalence of the disease in each of the 52 weeks under report. The average notifications for the past ten years are shown in green. There were 9 deaths, which gives a case mortality of 1-6 per cent., against o-68 per cent, in 1913. The disease, as in recent years was of a mild type. The attack rate per thousand inhabitants was 4·6, against 5·9 in 1913. In 32 cases the source of infection was attributed as follow :— Previous cases in house or family or neighbouring houses 17 School infection 2 " Return " cases 13 In the 13 cases classified as " return" cases the source of infection was some other member of the family or occupant of the same house who had returned from hospital after an attack of scarlet fever within a fortnight previous to the second case occurring, in this case the source of infection in the second case is presumed to be the child recently returned from hospital. The following statement on the subject is reprinted from my Annual Report for 1907 : —" A good deal of attention has been given to these so-called "return" cases on the part of the laity, and also by medical authorities, the former generally being inclined to attribute it to premature discharge from the infectious disease hospital. As stated however, in previous reports, facts do not support this view, because in the first place the cases are very few compared with the number discharged, and in the second case it is sometimes those children who are detained months over the usual time and that cannot be considered to have been prematurely discharged who produce the disease. "The micro-organism which produces scarlet fever has yet to be discovered, and the probability is that when this is made it will be found it behaves in a somewhat similar manner to diphtheria, and will be found to exist in the noses and throats of the patients who either have not got the disease at all, or who have recovered from an attack some considerable time previously. Those patients who have suffered from complications leading to pathological discharges from nose, throat and ears are more liable to spread the disease than simple, uncomplicated cases." Measles The number of deaths for 1914 was 79, against 88 in 1913, 101 in 1912 and 51 in 1911. The annexed table gives the number of notifications received from schools, the number of "contacts" excluded. In the first quarter there were 14 deaths, in the second 24, in the third 26, and in the fourth 15. This disease is subject to considerable fluctuations, and as practically every child gels it it depends largely on the number of susceptible children and the number of foci in a district which start the infection. As remarked in my previous report, there is no doubt that the infants' departments of the schools are very largely responsible for the spread of this disease, though the London County Council's regulations, of which the following is a copy, are strictly carried out: (1) Senior Departments — (a) If a child has had measles it need not be excluded from attendance at school. (b) If a child has not had measles it should be excluded from attendance at school until Monday following 14 days from the commencement of the illness of the last case in the house. (2) Infants Departments — All children should be excluded from attendance at school until Monday following 14 days from the commencement of the illness of the last case in the house. Enteric Fever. 8 cases of enteric fever were notified, being 5 for Bermondsey, 3 for Rotherhithe, and none for St. Olave. 2 cases were returned as not suffering, making an actual total of 6. The total number of cases notified in the previous year was 26. Puerperal Fever. 5 cases of puerperal fever were notified. There were 2 deaths. Membranous Croup. No notification of this disease was received during the year under report. Opthalmia Neonatorum. There were 21 cases of this disease notified daring the year. Under this heading is included every kind of "sore eyes" occurring in the newly born. They were all visited by the Health Visitors, who instructed them to immediately seek medical advice. Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. 5 cases of this disease were notified. The following paragraph printed in last year's annual report represents my view as at present. Most of the cases diagnosed under this heading in London are cases of meningitis occurring in children and have been long known as "post-basic meningitis "or" Still's disease." They have always been with us, but as they are caused by a micro-organism which resembles that causing the disease known as cerebro-spinal fever, which occurs in outbreaks, it was thought advisable by the London County Council to include them under the term " cerebro-spinal fever." Dr. T. Houston, of Belfast, who has had an opportunity of investing a large outbreak which occurred there in 1911 and 1912, is of opinion that the micro-organisms of the two diseases, although belonging to the same group, are fundamentally different and give rise to different diseases, and with this view, on present evidence I am inclined to agree. The cases notified in Bermondsey gave rise to no other cases, but disinfection and isolation were carried out. Acute Polio-Myelitis. One case of this disease was notified during the year under report. The disease is commonly known as infantile paralysis and is a very common cause of deformities of the arms or legs seen in adults. It frequently takes the form of an arm or leg ceasing to grow and on enquiry one finds it came on in childhood. The disease is an infection of parts of the interior of the spinal cord and exists in two forms, viz. : sporadic when odd cases occur about a district and do not spread and epidemic form when several cases occur together and seem to be connected with one another. The above case may be described as sporadic. It is not so fatal as cerebro-spinal meningitis, but it is more liable to leave paralytic conditions behind. The case recovered but there was some paralysis of the limbs left. The organism causing the disease is not known. Children excluded from School on account of Infectious Diseases. School.

Ashdown. Unsound, Food and Foreign Meat Regulations. In reviewing the operations, in this district, under the abovementioned regulations for the twelve months ended December 31st, 1914, comparisons with past years will not be of their usual value as indicators of trade or percentage of waste in the foodstuffs arriving. During the first seven months, there appeared to be a general and considerable increase of foods landed in the district, but during the latter five (the period of the war) ships from some ports that previously discharged here regularly stopped, from others the number decreased and the arrivals were irregular, while from others the ships were more numerous and the goods of greater variety; but the largest increase to the wharves —especially at the West end of the district was by river craft from the docks. It is interesting to note that while the service of boats from Russia was much curtailed during the latter months the quantity of bacon landed in the district during the year increased from about 108,000 packages in 1913 to about 144,000 packages during the present year. Bacon and Pork Products. During the period under report five additional certificates were declared admissible, four relative to Russian and one to Swedish products. These have greatly reduced the Inspectorial duties with regard to bacon and the amount seized has been small. With regard to other pork products, especially tongues from Russia, these, although certificated in accordance with the regulations, were found to be still diseased to such an extent that the certificate was ignored. Representations on the matter were made to the authorities concerned but without the desired result and the last consignment of the year after examination was stopped. Beef, Frozen. The quantity examined in the district was above the average, and with regard to Australian the percentage found infested with worm nests has been exceedingly small, but several parcels of forequarters arrived, not cut in accordance with the inter-departmental agreements, consequently these were stopped and dealt with by the firms concerned under our supervision. Beef Tongues. No alteration has been made in the regulations for dealing more effectively with these. Beef Offal. Only small quantities have reached this district un-examined by some other water-side Authority. Butter. Only 7 lots about 40 tons have been dealt with under the regulations, and of this one parcel was re-shipped to the port of origin. Coffee. Only a small quantity has been dealt with under the regulations, but I again direct official attention to the traders' views generally put forward when dealing with unsound parcels of this commodity, viz., no matter how unfit or useless a parcel may be, the trader generally contends it can be treated and made fit for human consumption by mixing it with a better class coffee, indicating that the market value is the only consideration. Canned Goods. The quantities of these goods landed in this district, especially meats, has for a considerable time been on the decrease. Eggs. We have adhered to the methods of the past few years in dealing with these, but consequent upon the war and principally the reduced quantity from Russia during the latter five months of the year, the number of cases (about 312,000) landed, is considerably below the quantities landed in previous years, but the amount found unfit and destroyed is larger, part of the result of increased supervision and part due to lengthened time in transit. In my opinion it is very necessary and would be greatly to the advantage of consumer and trader if more definite restrictions were introduced prohibiting the sale of unsound eggs (this refers principally to those known in the wholesale trade as "spots") and the better class traders generally would welcome and support the introduction of some such measure. Further, eggs like other articles should be sold for what they really are, and it should be illegal to sell pickled eggs, cold stored, etc., etc., without disclosing the fact. Peels in Brine. We have continued the efforts of last year in the attempt to improve the packing, thereby lessening the waste in this commodity, but the improvement is not marked. Soft Fruit and Vegetables. Consequent upon the war and the regular service of boats to and from Boulogne being suspended the quantities landed here has been small. Customs Authorities. The most amicable feeling still exist with these Officers and the ever ready and valuable assistance rendered by them is deserving of the warmest thanks. Destruction of Unsound Foods. Since barging away has been,discontinued, this is a matter becoming more and more difficult and costly, the destructor being in reality more used as a Power Generating Station than destructor, and as a result, only the combustible portions of condemned goods are accepted there and that in many cases only after considerable labour has been expended and costs incurred in the preparation of it. The tip used by the Council is out of the district, and is not under the Council's control. It is further, prohibitive for the reception of food stuffs both from the point of view of distance and cost. Inspections. In Table XII. of Appendix will be found particulars of the general sanitary work by the District Inspectors during 1914, and in Table IX. the number of premises on the Registers to which special attention has been paid. The house-to-house inspections number 5,336. This is 1,066 above the total for the previous year, and is an average of 667 per Inspector, against 534 in 1913. 4,949 intimation notices were served, compared with 4,829 and 1,302 statutories, against 1,273 in the previous year.

There were therefore many consultations between the Local Government Board and the War Office as to how this could best be accomplished, with the result that the Local Government Board issued various circulars instructing the Medical Officer of Health and sanitary staff to cooperate as far as possible with the military authorities in the district and exchange with them information as to infectious disease, etc. They also asked the staff to inspect places where soldiers were billetted in the district, either for the purpose of guarding public works or for any other purpose. All cases of infectious disease which had any connection with the troops were immediately reported to the commanding officer of the regiment concerned. Guards were billetted at various points of the goods depot of the London, Brighton and South Coast and South-Eastern and Chatham Railways and at other important points in the Borough. These were regularly inspected by myself and the sanitary inspectors, weekly reports being sent up to the Deputy Director of Medical Services for the London District at the Horse Guards. Lists of houses where soldiers were billetted were also received from the police and these were kept under observation. Any defects found in any of the billets were first of all reported to the commanding officer of the district and if not remedied in a reasonable time they were reported to the Deputy Director of Medical Services who took steps to see the recommendations for remedying the defects were carried out. Another important piece of supervision was carried out by the Food Inspectors, acting under myself. This consisted in the regular inspection of the manufacture of articles of food for the Army and Navy carried on under contract by firms in the Borough. This was done in close consultation with the medical inspectors of the Local Government Board. The Board received intimation of all contracts from the War Office and immediately sent them on to us and we inspected the process of manufacture during the completion of the contract. On several occasions we found it necessary to interfere with the selection of raw materials and with the methods of manufacture, cleanliness of premises, etc., and I feel quite certain that this important work was of great benefit to the troops and am confident that very little of the food supplied by Bermondsey firms had to be rejected on its arrival at the front. The various activities here described will be continued during the period of the war. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... New occupiers or Premises ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

In Tables XIII. and XIV. of Appendix will be found a list of the samples taken in 1914, and the action taken; 1,186 samples were taken, compared with 1,193 in 1913 and 1,175 in 1912. Of these 11.6 per cent. were found adulterated, compared with 14.7 per cent, in the previous year and 8.1 per cent. in 1912. The most notable feature of the analysis of samples of this and recent years is the number of adulterations of milk which show the addition of small percentages of water, ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 per cent. This is due to the present standard which requires 3 per cent. of fat and 8.5 per cent. of non-fatty solids. Magistrates and others are liable to forget that this so-called "standard" represents the lowest limit below which milk must not go. The vast majority of natural milks show considerably higher figures, and the result is that the samples are watered down so as to be as near as possible this "standard" and the small percentages show that they occasionally overstep the mark. Sixteen per cent. is the amount of water allowed in butter, and it is astonishing how closely manufacturers keep to this amount, but occasionally they also overstep the mark, but even this small percentage beyond the legal limit is very beneficial to the trader if undected, since he can make a very large profit out of 1 per cent. In the accompanying table will be seen the percentages of milk fat in the various samples of milk. 1905 505 9 1.7 216 42.8 168 33.3 112 22.2 1906 507 3 0.6 211 41.6 178 35.1 115 22.7 1907 617 24 3.9 232 37.6 249 40.3 112 18.1 1908 575 2.1 258 44.9 226 39.3 79 12 13.7 1909 10 1.4 332 722 46.0 271 37.5 109 15.1 1910 676 5 0.7 294 43.5 281 41.6 96 14.2 1911 778 22 2.8 395 50.8 282 36.2 79 10.2 1912 787 37 4.7 375 47.6 306 38.8 69 8.8 1913 613 6.7 303 49.4 209 34.0 60 41 9.7 1914 565 35 6.2 258 45.7 228 40.4 44 7.8 635 3.0 287 44.9 37.6 Average, 10 yrs. 19 239 87 14.2 Bacteriological Laboratory.

The following reports were made to the Council, who gave instructions for a copy of the handbill to be left at every house and the posters to be fixed in various places in the Borough. Unfortunately owing to the outbreak of war almost immediately after initiating the campaign, this fell rather flat and people showed more anxiety about national than domestic affairs. Nevertheless it did good and from conversation with the members of the working classes I found much more knowledge about flies than I would have anticipated. "Now that summer is approaching it is advisable that the Committee should consider what, if anything, can be done to lessen the mortality from infective diarrhœa which is especially prevalent during that season. In 1910 the deaths numbered 87; in 1911, 226; in 1912, 84; and in 1913, 78. The victims are practically all infants under two years of age and between 70 and 80 per cent. of these under one year of age. I have drawn attention to the matter in every annual report since 1901 and am doing so specially this spring since some new information bearing on the cause of the disease has come to light within the last 18 months. The onset of the disease is as a rule sudden. A young infant apparently quite well takes to vomiting its milk; this is accompanied by diarrhœa and severe pains in the abodmen. At first the motions are natural but they shortly become watery and very frequent; the infant rapidly becomes exhausted and within a few hours to two or three days death occurs from collapse and heart failure. The symptoms in the severer forms, whether they occur in infants or adults are exactly similar to those of Asiatic cholera. In Asiatic cholera we know the specific micro-organism causing the disease but all attempts to find a special organism causing "summer" or D 49 "infective diarrhoea" have proved abortive. Various kind of bacteria found in the intestines have been in turn accused of causing the disease, but it may eventually turn out that there are several implicated. In the meantime there are certain facts established in connection with the causation and these are (1) The disease is strictly seasonal, i.e., it begins every year about the middle of June and continues till the middle or end of October after which period the mortality is very slight; (2) It is connected with heat: this is proved by its occurrence in summer and also by the fact that if the summer is hot and dry the deaths may be trebled or quadrupled as compared with a cold wet summer: in 1911 when we had 226 deaths in Bermondsey the summer was very hot and dry to be followed by a cold wet summer in 1912 with only 84 deaths: 1913 with its 78 deaths was notoriously cool and wet; (3) Contamination of food, especially of milk, has long been considered as a cause, the main proof of this being the comparative immunity of breast fed infants; and (4) It is infective, i.e., when one person in a house gets an attack it is liable to spread to other members. "All the above-mentioned are well established facts, but while it is clear that the disease is infective and should be classed with the infectious diseases the method of spread from one case to another has remained obscure. Since the discovery in the latter part of the last century that malaria is spread by mosquitoes, insects of various sorts have been looked upon as possible bearers of disease. We know this to be true of yellow fever which is conveyed by a different species of mosquito than that causing malaria and also of sleeping sickness which is spread by the tsetse fly. The last insect which has come to be suspected is the common house fly and allied species such as blue-bottles, manure flies, etc. During the last two years investigations have been carried on by many scientific workers, especially those of the Local Government Board and they have pretty well established the fact that these insects are capable of spreading many diseases. Such diseases include epidemic diarrhoea, typhoid fever, cholera, ophthalmia, tuberculosis, diphtheria and possibly many others. When one considers the habits of flies this will not appear extraordinary; they walk over and feed on all sort of filth, and no doubt transfer injested bacteria to our food and drink by means of their excreta, but also by means of their feet and legs which become covered with infective material. As a matter of fact typhoid tubercle and other bacilli have actually been found on and in flies as a result of the habits above-mentioned. From these investigations it is now believed that flies perform the chief role in the spread of summer diarrhœa. They walk over excreta, some of which may be from previous cases of diarrhoea, and then walk into the baby's milk, or other food, with the natural result that the consumer takes the disease. "If you want to stop or lessen diarrhoea some means should therefore be taken to get rid of flies. There are two distinct methods, viz.: (1) Killing individual flies with fly papers and poisonous fluids, and (2) destroying their eggs and larvae. This last method is by far the best and has been adopted most successfully in the case of mosquitoes. Killing individual flies is very useful but for one which you destroy this way you can kill thousands by the second plan. A consideration of the life history of the fly will show why the first plan is not likely to succeed. "In the spring the female fly lays her eggs on manure heaps, ashpits or any collection of moist refuse and lays about 120 eggs at each sitting of which there may be several. From these eggs in the course of a few hours, especially in the presence of heat and moisture, a maggot or grub issues and feeds on the filth it lives in and in about five days becomes a chrysalis which is a 'minute rolled up bean like body' with a hard covering about ¼ inch in length; in another five days the fly emerges from the chrysalis and begins searching for food. If one could stop these breeding places in and about houses the number of flies would be enormously reduced and means should be taken by posters and handbills to draw the attention of householders to the necessity of scrupulous cleanliness if flies are to be got rid of. The dust should be collected in covered receptacles, frequently removed, no garbage of filth of any sort should be allowed to lie about yards, all of which should be properly paved, no unused or waste food should be allowed to lie about unprotected and all food which is put by for use at another time should be kept in cupboards to which flies have no access. Milk both in milkshops and homes should be very carefully covered and in addition to this fly papers freely used. "I recommend therefore that I be instructed to draw up a small leaflet containing the life history of the house fly, the diseases which are liable to be spread and the best methods of getting rid of them, and that one of these be distributed about the latter end of May or beginning of June." D 2 51 Copy of poster and handbill: — "Summer Diarrhœa and Flies. "Hundreds of babies die every year from summer diarrhoea. This disease comes on suddenly accompanied by vomiting and baby rapidly becomes worse very often in spite of medical attention. It is, therefore, much more important to prevent summer diarrhœa from coming than to endeavour to cure it after the patient is attacked. "Summer diarrhœa is always due to contamination of food, especially milk, by dirt of every description, and it has now been proved that this dirt is almost always conveyed by flies who walk over and feed on filth and carry infection about on their bodies, legs and probosces. Flies spread many diseases in this way, such as summer diarrhoea, cholera, consumption, typhoid fever, etc. It is therefore, most important to get rid of flies. This is more easily done if we attack their breeding places as the following account of the development of the fly shows. "In the spring the female fly lays her eggs on manure heaps, ashpits or any collection of moist refuse and lays about 120 eggs at each sitting of which there may be several. From these eggs in the course of a few hours, especially in the presence of heat and moisture, a maggot or grub issues and feeds on the filth it lives in and in about five days becomes a chrysalis which is a 'minute rolled up bean like body' with a hard covering about ¼ inch in length; in another five days the fly emerges from the chrysalis and begins searching for food. "The best way, therefore, of exterminating flies is to prevent the accumulation of any dirt in or about the house where flies can feed and breed. "1. Keep all food which is not consumed at meal times in a cool cupboard where flies cannot reach it. "2. Waste food which can be burnt should be put in the fire instead of throwing in the dust bin. "3. All garbage and vegetable matter which cannot be burnt should be put in the dustbin and carefully covered. "4. See that all back yards are properly paved and regularly swept so that no dirt will be about. "5. All manure should be sprinkled with carbolic or some other disinfectant and removed daily. "6. Fly papers and traps are very useful but it is much more important not to leave food and other materials about that they can feed and breed on. "7. Sugar, treacle and jams should not be left lying about uncovered. "8. Milk vessels should be carefully covered with a damp cloth when not in use. "9. Scrupulous cleanliness in the house, especially where food is prepared, eaten, or stored, is most important. "10. Scrupulous cleanliness outside in yards and outhouses is also very important." "The campaign which has been instituted by the Council through the distribution of the handbills and posters is being followed up. The inspectors have received practical instruction in the development of flies so that they now know where to look for their breeding places. The clergymen, doctors, and others are being written to with a view to enlisting their sympathy and cooperation and following the advice of Dr. E. Halford Ross, of the Lister Institute, who has written an excellent little book on the subject, and to whom I am indebted for many suggestions, I am having a spot map of "fly lairs" prepared, so that those places which breed a large number of flies will be kept under observation with a view to systematic cleansing."

The total number of births which took place in Bermondsey last year was 3,757 and of these 3,7 2 7 were notified under the Notification of Births Act, 1907. The difficulty referred to in earlier reports of getting the whole of the cases notified has to a large extent been overcome by the sending out to parents and doctors the special letters mentioned in my comments on this table for 1911. lam still of opinion that it would have been better had the time allowed for registration been shortened from six weeks to one, instead of having a special Act. An endeavour is now being made to hunt up delinquents, and a letter is being sent to the medical practitioners pointing out to them that it is their duty to inform the father of his duty under the Act, and that the medical man in attendance is not exempt unless he has reason to believe that someone else has notified. Of the 3,727 births notified, 2,777 received primary visits from the Health Visitors. The number of secondary visits was 322. Of this number 2,742 were breast fed, so that, with very lew exceptions, breast feeding among the working classes in Bermondsey is the rule. This, however, only continues tor a period of a month, or six weeks at furthest, after which period working mothers here find it necessary to supplement the meagre income by work of some description. Their infants are then left in charge of a stranger or some inexperienced member of the family, the result being they are art ificially fed, and the wonder is that the infantile mortality is not much greater. It speaks well for the vitality of the infantile population that they survive the extraordinary methods of feeding to which some of them are subjected. Any enquiries into the subject of breast feeding and the best methods of ensuring its continuance will be incomplete if the economic conditions of the mothers is not taken into account. BABIES' CLASS. At the beginning of the war a branch of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association was established in the Town Hall with a result that the Babies' Class had to find new quarters. After a short stay in the Sanitary Inspector's Office it was finally removed out to the Temporary Shelter in the depôt. This is a much more convenient place as we have a waiting room, an undressing and weighing room and a medical consultation room. The attendance has been unusally good and averaged 17, which is much higher than the year before. The medical part of the consultation was done by myself. The advice seems to be very much appreciated by the mothers and we have had abundant evidence that it has proved very useful. The clientele has been mostly drawn from the Western Health Visitor's district as mothers from the Eastern District which comprises Rotherhithe and the eastern end of the late Vestry of Bermondsey find it rather far to come. At the time of writing a subsidiary class has been started in a room at 163, Abbeyfield Road for the loan of which we have to thank Sister Mirian, of the Lady Gomm Dispensary. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. The following scheme was submitted to the Council, but owing to financial and other conditions produced by the war the Council could not see their way to adopt the suggestions. Maternity and Child Welfare and School for Mothers. "The undermentioned are outlines of two schemes suggested to Sanitary Authorities by the Board of Education and Local Government Board respectively for the purpose of supervising the health of infants and young children prior to school age and if necessary provide for treatment. Provision is made for the repayment to the Sanitary Authorities of a sum of about half the expenditure incurred. This is done so as to encourage local authorities to extend their work on the lines indicated. Board of Education: — 1. The Board of Education will make grants to Schools for Mothers during the financial year ending on March 31st, 1915. in respect of the provision made for promoting the care, training and physical welfare of infants and young children. 2. A School for Mothers is primarily an educational institution, providing training and instruction for the mother in the care and management of infants and little The imparting of such instruction may include:— (a) systematic classes, (b) home visiting, (c) infant consultations. The provision of specific medical and surgical advice and treatment (if any) should be only incidental. 3. Grant will be assessed on the basis of work done by the institution during the year ending March 31st, 1914. 4. Where, in the Board's opinion, the provision made by the institution is adequate and its working is efficient, grant may be paid at the rate of one-half of the approved expenditure. In other cases the Board may either pay at a lower rate or withhold the grant. 5. In fixing the rate of grant the Board will take into consideration the scope, character and efficiency of the work of the institution. In this connection the Board will have regard to the provision made for:- (a) co-ordinating the work of the institution with that of: — (i) similar institutions in the same district; (ii) Baby Clinics and Infant Dispensaries providing medical and surgical advice and treatment for infants and little children; (iii) the School Medical Service on the one hand and the Sanitary Authority on the other. (b) keeping records of attendances at the institution and of visits paid to the homes. 6. (a) The institution must be conducted by a responsible Body of Managers, and a person must be appointed to act as Correspondent on behalf of the Managers. The institution must not be conducted for private profits or farmed out to any member of the staff. 7. Any institution desiring a grant under these regulations should forward to the Board of Education a statement in an approved form of the work done. 8. The Board may disregard any items of expenditure which, in their opinion, should not be taken into account. Local Government Board: — A complete scheme would comprise the following elements, each of which will, in this connection, be organised in its direct bearing on infantile health. 1. Arrangements for the local supervision of midwives. 2. Arrangements for: — (1) An Ante-Natal clinic for expectant mothers. (2) The home visiting of expectant mothers. AnteNatal. (3) A maternity hospital or beds at a hospital, in which complicated cases of pregnancy can receive treatment. 3. Arrangements for: — (1) Such assistance as may be needed to ensure the mother having skilled and prompt attendance during confinement at home. Natal. (2) The confinement of sick women, including women having contracted pelvis or suffering from any other condition involving danger to the mother or infant at a hospital. 4. Arrangements for: — (1) The treatment in a hospital of complications arising after parturition, whether in a mother or in the infant. (2) The provision of systematic advice and treatment for infants at a baby clinic or infant dispensary. (3) The continuance of these clinics and dispensaries, so as to be available for children up to the age when they are entered on a school register, i.e., the register of a public elementary school, nursery school, creche, day nursery, school for mothers or other school. Post- Natal. (4) The systematic home visitation of infants and of children not on a school register as above defined. These schemes differ essentially, that for the Board of Education is concerned with the teaching of mothers and supervision of children from birth to school age, and there is no provision for treatment of any kind. The scheme of the Local Government Board on the other hand is concerned principally with the provision of treatment for mothers in pregnancy and child-birth, and treatment of children from birth to school age. The schemes seem to overlap one another to a certain extent because it is impossible to provide treatment without a certain amount of supervision, or to supervise and teach without making some provision for treatment. To carry out the suggestion of the Board of Education would undoubtedly be the easier as far as London is concerned and would not entail embarking on any new and elaborate schemes. In Bermondsey it would mean an extension of our work more or less on its present lines. A beginning could be made by appointing two more Health Visitors and in this way not only expectant mothers would be kept under more or less supervision, but it would be possible to visit all infants, extend our present class, and where medical treatment was desirable or necessary, to follow up cases, and see that it was carried out. At present it is our custom in the babies' class or where the Health Visitor finds any poor people in the course of their visits whose infants require treatment, to give them a card referring them to the Children's Department of Guy's Hospital. We find the advice is nearly always followed, but we confine ourselves almost exclusively to children under one year of age, and this age period could easily be extended. The scheme by the Local Government Board would be more difficult to carry out in its entirety since it aims at the provision of clinics or dispensaries for the treatment of mothers, babies and young children. It seems to me that in London there is sufficient treatment for all these purposes provided by the general and special hospitals, and dispensaries as well as the L.C.C. Clinics. What is rather required is that pregnant women should know where to apply should they desire advice or treatment. Should it prove that there is not sufficient accommodation provided at present, then the question of the establishment of dispensaries and clinics referred to could be taken into consideration. This scheme as it stands would require the provision of a properly qualified medical man as well as a couple of fully trained nurses, a couple of Health Visitors, also a suitably equipped building. Either scheme would also require the provision of one or more clerks to keep the full records which would be handed on to the school authorities after the child goes on the school register. The 'Ante-Natal' and 'Natal' schemes of the Local Government Board would require very careful consideration because it will be difficult to get anything like a complete list of expectant mothers. Further, if there is too much fussy interference there is a danger that the process of child-birth may become to be looked upon as a species of illness instead of a perfectly normal physiological process, and such a frame of mind would not be at all conducive to the production of healthy children. Provision need only be made for mothers who cannot take advantage of the benefits of the National Insurance Act under which the advice of a qualified medical man is always available. There are at present two institutions in the Borough which are carrying on work among mothers and infants. One is the Bermondsey Settlement, Farncombe Street, and the other the Princess Club, Jamaica Road. The work of the former consists in educating prospective mothers in the hygiene of pregnancy, and also later in the management of their infants. There are four branches in different parts of the Borough, and the average weekly attendance is seventy-two. It was founded in 1908. The Babies' Class at the Princess Club was formed last July, and is more of a baby clinic on the lines of the Local Government Board scheme. There are two qualified lady doctors in attendance twice a week, and the children are given treatment. The average attendance is twenty. At present the quarters originally intended for this are being used as a hospital and the clinic has been removed to St. James' Mission Hall, Alexis Street." Since writing the above report certain considerations brought about by the war have forced themselves more insistently upon me. We are at present as a nation passing through what is probably the greatest crisis in our history and if we are to be successful must continue to pour into the field every man of military age we can spare. This will necessarily entail during and after the war a shortage of available husbands and prospective fathers, with the inevitable result of a serious reduction of the infantile population for many years to come. It is also one of the evil consequences of war that the inefficients who remain behind can propagate their stock while the most vigorous have their ranks depleted. It behoves us therefore as a Sanitary Authority to take a broad view of this national disaster and endeavour to adopt all available means to preserve the lives of the children we have. It has been shown over and over again that much of our infant mortality is preventible and due to ignorance and carelessness on the part of parents, and if therefore we can enlighten the ignorant on child-care and bring pressure to bear on the careless surely it is our business to undertake the work. Parents are primarily responsible for their children's welfare and in all our endeavours we should aim rather at pointing out and impressing on them their duty than relieving them of their responsibilities. To many the present will not seem a suitable time for expenditure of large sums of money on what they consider a somewhat doubtful venture, but while it may be argued that certain of the work suggested is of a more or less experimental character this does not apply to what we are already doing, and I think a suitable beginning of the Local Government Board scheme might very well be made by extending our present work. This is being carried on on sound and well established lines and on these we could proceed gradually to a complete scheme. Acting on this assumption I have seriously considered the matter from the administrative and financial point of view with the object of getting the maximum benefit with the minimum expenditure compatible with efficiency. In our shelter in the Neckinger Depot there are four tenements, two on the ground floor and two on first floor. The smaller ground floor tenement is at present used for children's baths, but the other ground floor tenement, which is at present unused and consists of two bedrooms, kitchen, w.c. and bathroom, could be converted at very little cost into a suitable maternity centre. For this purpose one general waiting room, one consultation and weighing room, one medical consulting room, a dispensary and lavatory would constitute the minimum requirements, and all of these we have ready to hand in the shelter. The kitchen would be the general waiting room and the large bedroom would make a very good weighing and undressing room while the small bedroom would make an ideal medical consulting room. The bathroom could at a trifling cost be fitted up as a small dispensary. My proposal is that there should be two consultations during the week on Tuesdays and Thursdays instead of the one which is held at present. The only additional staff imperatively required is two additional Health Visitors. With such an addition the Borough could be divided into four districts each half the size of the present ones, for only by a reduction of the Health Visitors districts to a more manageable size than what they have charge of now will it become possible for them to cultivate the acquaintance of the mothers and prospective mothers and children under their charge. Under existing arrangements it is only possible to visit about two thirds of the newly born infants and that but once —second visits and the regular following up of cases requiring close supervision are done only to a very limited extent. Two Health Visitors would attend the maternity centre on Tuesdays and the other two on Thursdays, and each Health Visitor would recommend women and children from their districts to attend on the days when they would be at the centre themselves. The task of special medical consultation I propose doing myself, at least, for the period of the war, and the keeping of records would devolve on one of the present clerical staff. The Local Government Board scheme suggests that regular medical and surgical treatment should be given at maternity centres but while this is imperative in many provincial districts it is not so in London on account of the existence of numerous general and special hospitals. I propose that medical treatment should only be given in a small number of mild and special cases where either through poverty or other sufficient reason patients are unable to avail themselves of the advice of a private medical practitioner or of one of the hospitals. There are also a certain number of trivial cases of illness which could be treated without putting them to the inconvenience of attending a hospital and which would at the same time relieve the out-patient department, giving them more time to devote to the more serious cases. As far as pregnant women are concerned our experience is that they often want general advice on the care of their own health, and the various preparations necessary for childbirth, which advice could very suitably be given by properly qualified Health Visitors. Special cases such as are likely to require operative treatment before or at childbirth would be referred to me, and should I find that this is so I could give them a recommendation card for Guy's Hospital where a certain number of beds are reserved for this purpose with the necessary staff. I have been in communication with the hospital authorities on this matter and have received an assurance that they will be prepared to co-operate on these lines as far as their accommodation permits. Should their beds be full the patients could be referred to special hospitals further away such as Waterloo Road or Chelsea. From inquiries I also learn that the children's department at Guy's Hospital and the Evelina Hospital for Children would undertake the treatment of children recommended to them by us. The idea of the Local Government Board is that for infants and young children medical advice, and where necessary, treatment should be continuously available till they are entered on the school register, when they come under the purview of the School Medical Officer. For this purpose proper medical records would have to be kept, which could be passed on later to the school authorities. As there are some voluntary institutions including the Extern Department of Guy's Hospital doing maternity and child welfare work in Bermondsey, I propose supplying them with similar record sheets or cards to our own and when they are filled up collecting them and passing them on to the School Medical Officer. This would produce co-operation between the municipal and voluntary agencies and prevent overlapping of work. Closer co-operation could also be insured by instructing the Health Visitors to send women and children needing advice or treatment to the nearest maternity centre whether municipal or voluntary. The chief difficulty would be to get hold of prospective mothers, and I think this can be got over by sending a circular letter to doctors and midwives informing them that should any of their cases require advice we would be prepared to give it. Health Visitors also, if their districts is not too large often come across or hear of pregnant women from neighbours and others, so I do not anticipate any dearth of subjects in this department of our work. The following is an estimate of the cost of the scheme and in those items where an exact sum cannot be given I have put an outside figure: — £ s. d. Rent, rates and taxes 10 0 0 Lighting and heating 5 0 0 Removing bath, reglazing windows, making and fixing drawers, shelves, etc. 15 10 0 Electric light fittings 3 15 0 Providing and fixing gas brackets, gas fires, etc. 3 11 6 Lino 6 0 0 Chairs, 2½ dozen 3 15 0 Drugs 5 0 0 Stationery 5 0 0 Roll top desk 6 0 0 Arm Chair 1 5 0 Stool for patients 0 10 0 10 0 Couch 3 10 0 Table for Clerk 1 10 0 £70 6 6 This makes a total of £70 6s. 6d. for the first year, half of which will be paid by a grant, leaving a net expenditure on the Borough of £35 3 s. 3d. The salaries of the extra Health Visitors will also have to be taken into account, and these will entail a net annual charge on the Borough of £105. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. There was a very close and cordial co-operation between the staffs of the Dispensary and the Public Health Department during the year 1914, the result being that there was little if any overlapping in their respective spheres. From the Dispensary Annual Report it seems that during the year there were 747 new patients examined, of these 373 were definitely suffering from or suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis in some form. The number of visits paid by patients to the dispensary was 11,237, and the number of visits paid to the homes of patients was 1,307 by the Medical Officer and 2,519 by the nurses. Hairdressers and Barbers. At the end of 1914 eleven barbers were in possession of certificates. IV.— FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. In Table X. of the Appendix will be found particulars of the inspections of factories and workshops, and in the following table particulars regarding the trades and persons employed in connection with workshops. There were workshops on the Register in 1914. Including bakehouses, of which there were 74 in use, the total is 402. OUTWORKERS. There were 454 outworkers on the Register at the end of 1914. 46 lists were sent in by firms in this Borough employing outworkers. Table X. of the Appendix shows the various trades followed by outworkers in this district. E APPENDIX. E 2 APPENDIX. Table I.—Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1914 and Previous Years.
