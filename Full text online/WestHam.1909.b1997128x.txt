LONDON: The Avenue Press, Ltd., Stratford, E., and 6 and 8, Bouverie Street, E.C. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, WEST HAM. To the Council of the County Borough of West Ham. Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, "Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under the Public Health Act is required by order of the Local Government Board to make an annual report with regard to the sanitary district which is under his superintendence ...... The report is to be for the year ending 31st December. It should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district, and with the means for improving those conditions. It should contain an account of the sanitary circumstances of the district, and of any improvement or deterioration which may have occurred during the year in those circumstances." In accordance with the above requirement, I beg to submit my annual report for the year 1909, and in doing so, desire to point out that such report must necessarily consist very largely of a summary of my periodical reports and other matters which have been under discussion by the Council during the year, and which, therefore, are more or less within the immediate recollection of the members. The collated returns, however, and the statement of local circumstances which may appear superfluous to members fully conversant with them, serve not only as valuable statistical records for future reference, but are needed by the Local Government Board and other authorities, to whom the Medical Officer of Health is required to forward copies. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health. A 2 4 Physical Features and General Character of the District West Ham is situate in latitude 51° 30' to 51° 33' N., and longitude 0° 1' W., to 0° 3' E., on the extreme west of the County of Essex, and on the eastern side of the administrative County of London, from which it is sepa i by the windings of the River Lee and Bow Creek for 3½ miles. In shape it is an irregular rhomboid. some 2 miles from west to east and 4 miles from north to south, comprising within its boundaries 4,706 acres. The northern and eastern sides of the Borough are contiguous to the populated districts of Leyton and East Ham. The southern boundary is formed by the River Thames for 2½ miles. In. elevation it is almost flat, varying from less than 5ft. to 45ft. above ordnance, about half of the area being not more than 10ft. above that level Chalk may be reached at depths varying from 100ft. to 150ft, orerlaid by green Thanet sands and Woolwich beds, on which rests 5ft. to 50ft. of London clay. In the north-eastern half of 15ft. to 20ft. of river drift gravel overlays the London clay, sloping down towards the River Lee and River Thames into marshy clay and alluvium, a large part of the immediate surface being made ground. 5 METEOROLOGY. The observations given below are extracted from the weekly reports of observations taken at Greenwich Observatory, a course justified by the geographical position of the Borough immediately to the North of Greenwich. They show that the registered sunshine of the year was 1,640.7 hours, being 6.9 hours more than in 1908. The hottest day was 12th August when the temperature reached 86.2 degrees, and the coldest day was 5th March, when it sank to 13.6 degrees. The number of rainy days was 186, the total rainfall of the year being 25.77 inches. The greatest daily fall occurred on 24th June, when 1.08 inches fell. Meteorology during 1909.

Large factories abound on the river frontages west and south, railway works employing thousands of regular hands are located in the north, and large docks the staple support of casual labour intersect the south. The rest of the area may be said to form the dormitory of artizans, clerks, and others, whose daily work is carried on in London, together with the local shops and retail businesses necessary for the welfare of their families. There is no particular industry calculated to specially affect the public health. Housing Accommodation.—The dedicated roads of the Borough extend to 123¾ miles, some four-fifths of which are at least 40ft. wide, and are bordered by houses of two storeys. Originally constructed as self-contained houses, they have, in large measure, been adapted by alterations and additions for the accommodation of two families, while in recent years the flat system has been generally adopted in developing the newer estates. Very few blocks of dwellings of three or more storeys exist, and the unsatisfactory character of these give rise to the need for constant supervision and action by the Sanitary Staff. The erection of all new buildings are supervised by Building Inspectors of the Borough Engineer's Department. At the census in 1901 there were 41,368 inhabited houses in the Borough, and a house to-house visitation of these is regularly carried out. During the year 1909 the number of dwelling-houses inspected was 14,101 while, in addition, 3,333 were visited on account of infectious disease. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, six houses (Nos. 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, High Street, Stratford) were reported by the Medical Officer of Health as being in a state so dangerous to health as to be unfit for human habitation; only two of the houses were occupied. On 15th December Closing Orders were made by the 8 Magistrate (the owner consenting) in respect of the six houses, and thus were forthwith closed and boarded up. Water Supply.—Several large firms possess private wells drawing water from the chalk, but practically the whole of the Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, successors to the East London Water Company, the main source of the water being derived from the River Lee and the wells sunk by the latter company. Milk Supply.—Under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders, 371 premises were placed on the Register for the sale of milk at the commencement of the year, the majority of these are small general shops retailing very small quantities of milk, the storage of which is frequently of a doubtful character. On inspection, 300 were found to require cleansing or to exhibit defects remediable under the Public Health Acts. 24 milkshops were struck off the Register and 52 placed thereon during the year. In addition to the above, the Register contained the names of 19 persons registered as cowkeepers. 57 visits were paid to the cowsheds of these persons, and in several cases notices to cleanse or remedy structural defects were served upon the cowkeepers. One new cowshed was occupied, and most of the old ones were kept in a fairly clean state, but there is still much room for improvement in some, both in the character of the buildings and in the care exercised in the collection and distribution of the milk. With a view to the detection of Tuberculosis of the Udder, prior to the year 1908, an annual inspection of all cows in the Borough was made by the Council's Veterinary Surgeon, but in that year the Council, on the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, decided that a quarterly inspection should be made. 9 I append below Mr. Glover's reports for the year 1909:— Examination of Cows for Tuberculosis of the Udder. Veterinary Surgeon's Report. Cows were examined at the undermentioned places, comprising the whole of the registered cowsheds in the Borough containing cows:— Situation of Cowshed.

With two exceptions these were 10 quite healthy young animals. One of the two was affected with a suspicious knee, which, after a long period of sluggish enlargement, proved to be an ordinary abscess. The other had a nodular condition of the mammary gland, which has not yet resolved itself in the ordinary manner of simple mastitis. A sample of the milk is under examination, and security has been taken against its use for domestic purposes. The abnormalities of the older occupants of the sheds already reported present no development to cause concern. June Report.—Nearly one-sixth of this number are new animals, all free from objection. Two cows at Vicarage Lane had udders sosuggestive of tuberculosis that by agreement they were dried off, and one other from the same shed had its milk tested and found innocuous ; one or two cows elsewhere are under observation. September Report.—No cow exhibited any symptom of udder tuberculosis. There was only one case of acute mastitis (Edwin Street). Over 40 new cows have been introduced during the quarter, all of which are free from suspicion. The cows from the sheds at Blind Lane, Thomas Street, and Camel Road were out at pasture. December Report.—There was no case evidencing tuberculous udder. Four cases of sub-acute mastitis, confined in each instance to one quarter, and the milk not used. A smaller proportion of new cases and a larger number of fat (dry) than usual was attributed to market conditions. Many of the animals in the cooler sheds were rough in their coats, and there was a more than usual amount of coughing. These were no doubt the effects of a particularly ungenial season. The sanitary state of the sheds was generally good. RICHARD GLOVER, F.R.C.V.S. Food Inspection.—Each of the twelve Inspectors is required to inspect the food shops and slaughter-houses in his district. In 11 addition to these, the Food Inspector, who devotes the greater part of his time to the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, is charged equally with the other Inspectors with the duty of safeguarding the sale of food in market streets and other premises where dietary articles are exposed for sale. Inspection of Bakehouses and Fishshops is also carried out by the Inspectors, particular attention being directed to the regular removal of offal and trade refuse, which in all cases (except that of greengrocers) is carried out by private contractors. In the appendix to this report will be found a list of unsound food stuffs seized as unfit and unwholesome at its time of exposure for sale or condemned without formal seizure under Section 117, Public Health Act, 1875. During the year 1909 legal proceedings were instituted in two cases under the above section. In the first case the defendant was charged with exposing for sale in his shop some unsound oranges, and was fined £2. In the second case the defendant, a butcher was convicted of depositing for the purpose of preparation for sale two pieces of bacon and one brawn at his shop in Victoria Dock Road, and was fined .£10. Slaughter-houses.—There are now upon the Register 16 old registered slaughter-houses and one registered knacker's yard, together with 15 annually licensed slaughter-houses and one annually licensed knacker's yard. Owing to the proximity to the London market the amount of slaughtering carried out locally forms a small percentage of the meat sold, but the infrequency of use and scattered location of the private slaughter-houses render efficient inspection extremely difficult and very unsatisfactory. During the year 1909 (1) an application for the erection of a new slaughter-house was received from Mr. W. G. Streeton, of 12 Barber's Road, and after the building had been passed by the Borough Engineer and Medical Officer of Health, an annual license was granted by the Council; (2) a similar application was received from Mr. Henry Short, of 43, Warmington Street, and ultimately a license was granted upon conditions (a) that only swine should be slaughtered and (b) that the hours of slaughtering be limited to those between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.; (3) the slaughter-house, 176, Balaam Street, was transferred to Mr. Paul Kelle Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.—Although each Inspector of Nuisances is required by the terms of his appointment to take samples if necessary under the above Acts, a special Inspector is appointed ad hoc to devote the greater part of his time to carrying out the duties imposed by their provisions on the Council. In accordance with the order of the Local Government Board, dated 28th December, 1907, an application was received in March from Messrs. Pearks, Ltd., for the registration of the premises No. 21, Rathbone Street, Canning Town, for the purpose of the business of a wholesale dealer in margarine and milk-blended butter; and in September an application was made by Messrs. W. Younger for the registration of premises No. 18, Martin Street, for the business of a wholesale dealer in margarine; and in May an application was made for the registration of premises No. 14, Martin Street, as a butter factory. All these applications were granted. In September the Council resolved that the Medical Officer of Health be authorized to enter, inspect, and take samples in registered butter factories under Section 2 of the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907. Under these Acts 1,256 samples were purchased for analysis, and 97 were returned by the Public Analyst as adulterated, the number of samples taken being at the rate of 4.6 per 1,000 of the census 13 population. In London the samples taken during the year 1908 were at the rate of 5.3 per 1,000, and in the rest of England at the rate of 2.6 per 1,000. I applied for summonses in 52 cases, at the hearing of which fines and costs amounting to £105 4s. 0d. were imposed. The particulars of these will be found in the appendix. Article. Adulterated.

With few exceptions, all houses are provided with properlyflushed modern water-closets, discharging into appropriate pipe or brick sewers, which also convey the surface water and most of the rainfall. The southern portion of the Borough, being isolated by the Victoria and Albert Docks, is drained into a main sewer running from west to east through a narrow strip of the southern portion of the Borough of East Ham, whence it discharges into the London County Council sewer in North Woolwich. The north-western corner of the Borough—an area of roughly 120 acres, containing two terraces of houses and some isolated houses and factories—remains unsewered, the excrement disposal consisting of cesspools, while scattered cesspools are to be found here and there in a few places remote from the general system of sewerage. The sewers draining the main portion of the district (five-sixths of the whole area) converge by means of specially-constructed intercepting sewers to the Corporation's pumping station, situate near the middle of the western border of the Borough. Here the sewage is Number Percent. of Cases Lard— 12.0 cotton seed oil 1 Coffee— 90.0 chicory 1 38.0 1 17 pumped into the Northern Metropolitan Outfall Sewer, which crosses the Borough obliquely, whence it gravitates to the London outfall at Barking. Pollution of Streams.—The backwaters of the River Lee, which consist of some 6½ miles of tidal waterways and intersect about a quarter of the northern half of the Borough, are subject to pollution chiefly from the urban districts of Leyton and Walthamstow, which discharge their effluents into the Waterworks River north of West Ham. The scanty flow of pure water from above and the long periods during which the beds of the streams are exposed on the receding of the tide have frequently during the hot summer months led to serious complaints of nuisance, and the Corporation have had occasion not only to draw the attention of the Lee Conservancy Board to the nuisance arising in the Borough from the condition of the backwaters, but have also on their own initiative taken steps to palliate as far as possible the offensive state of the river beds. No radical improvement in these waterways can be hoped for until the effluents from the other districts shall cease to flow into these streams. Pollution also from time to time occurs by reason of the unauthorised overflow from piggeries into ditches communicating with the backwaters. One such nuisance was discovered in 1909, and dealt with by sanitary notice. These offences occur in that portion of the Borough which is unsewered as mentioned above, and will be a constant source of trouble until that district is properly sewered. At the end of 1909 the Lee Conservancy Board took proceedings against the Council in respect of a fouling of the Waterworks River at Stratford. The proceedings were stayed on the Council making arrangements to construct a special sewer for the reception of the drainage of the houses affected. Collection of House Refuse.—By the West Ham Corporation Act, 1888, the Corporation is empowered to require owners B 18 of houses to provide movable receptacles for house refuse instead of ashpits, and by special bye-law the occupiers of houses are required to place them outside their houses on such days as the Corporation fix. Under these provisions the house refuse is collected twice each week by the Council's own vehicles. Thirty-six carts and vans are used, and the staff employed numbers 56 men, beside the Dust Inspector and two foremen. The total amount collected during the 307 working days in the year was 28,391 loads, an increase of 388 loads on the previous year. The shoots on which the above house refuse was deposited, together with the number of loads in each case, are set out below:— Out of the Borough. Loads.

A letter was received by the Council from the Local Government Board, enclosing a complaint from the West Ham Board of Guardians that a pest of flies experienced at Savage Gardens, a group of houses situate half.a. mile from the shoot in a south.easterly direction, was due to the refuse on the Council's shoot. Also on March 7th, Professor R. T. Hewlett, Professor W. I. Simpson, and Colonel Alcock attended the Public Health Committee as a deputation from the Branch Seamen's Hospital, situate half.a.mile from the shoot in a southwesterly direction, to urge the Council to discontinue shooting at Beckton Road. The Council were unable to admit that the flies complained of either at Savage Gardens or the Branch Seamen's Hospital emanated from the shoot, but they instructed the Public Health Committee to consider and report upon other methods of dealing with house refuse. In the meantime fires have been kept constantly burning on the shoot with the result that most of the animal and vegetable matter and other soft refuse has been destroyed or rendered innocuous. BYE.LAWS RELATING TO OFFENSIVE TRADES COMMON LODGING.HOUSES, &c. Offensive Trades.—Upwards of thirty premises where statutory offensive businesses are carried on are located in the Borough, and include soap manufacturers, 9 ; fat melters and bone boilers, 12 ; gut scrapers, 2 ; fish and offal collectors, 2 ; organic manure manufacturers, 2; other trades, 3. These are subject to constant inspection, and may be said to be carried on with comparatively little nuisance to the general public. Several fresh applications were dealt with during the year 1909, of which the following are the particulars :— An application from Mr. W. Menzies, of St. Albans, for permission to establish the trade of sausage skin cleaning and gut band making 21 at premises in Sugar House Lane, was granted, subject to the premises being put into substantial repair and the drainage and water supply teing re.arranged to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. An application from Messrs. Williams, to establish soapmaking at premises in Windmill Lane, was granted, subject to no fat melting being carried on. The proceedings in this case subsequently resulted in a fresh application in respect of premises known as Magnet Works, Pudding Mill Lane, which application was granted, subject to the premises being put into repair to the satisfaction of the Committee. An application from Messrs. Harold Heydon & Co., of Old Paradise Street, Lambeth, to manufacture soap at Sugar House Lane, was granted. An application by Mr. F. Falco to melt fat at Temple Mill Lane was granted, subject to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health as to the arrangements therefor. Permission was also granted to Messrs. Frank How & Co. to carry on business of oil, varnish, and grease manufacturers at Nos. 77 and 79, High Street, Stratford. Common Lodging Houses.—There are 12 Common Lodging Houses in the Borough, six in the Stratford district and si* in the Tidal Basin district, all of which, with one exception, were orginally constructed and used for other purposes, such as private dwellings or warehouses, and have been adapted more or less successfully to meet the requirements of the Common Lodging House Bye.Laws. The accommodation in these amount to 659 beds. 22 During the year 1909 Mr. Thomas George Andrews was registered as the Keeper of the Common Lodging House, Nos. 11, 13, and 15, Fulton Street. On 17th March, 1909, a new license was granted in respect of No. 1, High Street, Stratford, of which Mr. Alfred Partner was registered as the Keeper. This house affords accommodation for 15 lodgers. Schools.—The Public Elementary Schools consist of 46 Council Schools, and 14 Non.Provided Schools, together with 4 Council Special Schools and 2 Higher Elementary Schools, affording in the aggregate accommodation for 68,826 scholars. The Schools are for the most part modern, substantially built buildings, adequately supplied with water, and provided with sufficient surrounding air space, while their general cleanliness appears to be well looked after. With a view to checking the spread of epidemic disease, it has been the practice for many years past for the Medical Officer of Health, on receiving information of the occurrence of infectious disease in the family of a scholar, to send a red.coloured notice to the Head Teacher of the School (Day School and Secondary School) recommending the exclusion of children coming from the infected home, subsequently followed by a white notice freeing the family from quarantine on the completion of the necessary isolation and the official disinfection of the premises. Each School is provided with a supply of disinfectants for general or special use. The particular action taken with regard to Schools during the year will be found under the heading " Chief Zymotic Diseases." Methods of Dealing with Infectious Disease.—Prior to the Infectious Disease Notification Act, 1899, the notification of 23 these diseases in West Ham had been compulsory for 11 years, under special powers obtained by the West Ham Corporation Act, 1888, which provided for the notification of all the diseases specified in the general Act, with the exception of Erysipelas and Membranous Croup. The Hospital accommodation of the Borough for the isolation of infectious disease consists of— (1) The Plaistow Fever Hospital (opened as to two wards in 1896, and as to the completed Hospital in 1901) now contains 210 beds, allocated to the following purposes: 110 beds for Scarlet Fever, 63 for Diphtheria, 22 for Enteric Fever, and 15 isolation beds for Mixed or Staff cases. (2) Dagenham Small.pox Hospital, situate about 9 miles from the Borough, occupying a site of 6| acres, enclosed within a farm of 119 acres, owned and cultivated by the Council, was opened in 1899. It consists of permanent buildings capable of accommodating 50 patients with the administrative staff required for their care, together with temporary iron buildings sufficient to treat 300 cases. Under agreement, seven other Sanitary Authorities contribute to the establishment and maintenance of this Hospital, in consideration of West Ham undertaking to receive and treat all the Small.pox cases sent to the Hospital by those Authorities. (3) The Grange Convalescent Home is situate about 9£ miles from the Borough, at Harold Wood, Essex, in which the accommodation is ample for 40 children. This Home consists of a residential mansion with outbuildings and 7 acres of grounds, together with 61½ acres of pasture land, and has required considerable alterations and additions to render it fit for its present use. The , Home was opened for the reception of patients on 22nd 24 February, 1909. I have appended to this report four photographs of the Home, kindly taken for me by my chief clerk, Mr. J. A. Cheatle. At the time of writing, your Public Health Committee are considering the question of adding an additional ward to accommodate 20 more patients. In connection with the Dagenham Hospital is a building containing an Equifex steam disinfector for Hospital use, while attached to the Plaistow Fever Hospital is a large Washington.Lyons disinfector, so arranged as to serve the purposes of a public disinfecting station for the treatment of bedding, &c., of infectious cases occurring in the Borough on removal to hospital or on recovery at home. Methods of Control of Tuberculosis.—Down to the end of 1908 no system, voluntary or compulsory, of notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis pertained in West Ham, and consequently very few cases of living consumptives were brought to the knowledge of the Public Health Department. On 1st January, 1909, The Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, issued by the Local Government Board, came into operation, by which the notification of Phthisis occurring in Poor Law Institutions or under the care of District Medical Officers became compulsory. In all cases notified a member of the Sanitary Staff visits the home, with a view to remedying of any existing defects in the structural surroundings of the patient, of advising him as to the necessity of properly using the means at his disposal, of aiding him by verbal converse and printed literature to appreciate the value to himself and his family of the proper treatment and disposal of his expectoration, and of teaching him the right use of disinfectants. In every case of a recorded death from Phthisis a similar visit is paid, disinfection of the premises advised and, in most cases, carried out. The Grange Convalescent Home, Harold Wood. The Grange Convalescent Home, Hakold Wood. The Grange Convalescent Home, Harold Wood. The Grange Convalescent Home, Harold Wood. 25 During the year 1909, 365 notifications of Phthisis in Poor Law cases were received. The total number of deaths from Phthisis in the whole Borough was 367, equal to a death.rate of 1.17 per 1,000, while the deaths from other tubercular diseases numbered 138, equal to a death.rate of 0.44 per 1,000. During the previous 10 years the average death.rate from Phthisis was 1 *25 per 1,000 and that of other tubercular diseases was 0'60 per 1,000. VITAL STATISTICS. The population of the Borough at the Census in 1901 was 267,358. The number of inhabited houses was 41,433, giving 6.4 persons to each house. The Registrar.General's estimate of the population at the middle of 1909 was 328,585. The area of the Borough is 4,706 acres, so that at the Census in 1901 there were 56.8 persons to the acre. Below is given the areas of the wards of the Borough (excluding water) and the population per acre in each ward at Census year :— Ward. Area in Acres. Persons per Acre. New Town 404.6 45.3 Forest Gate 256.6 77.7 High Street 550.4 34.5 Broadway 171.6 91.6 Park 262.0 58.3 Upton 270.8 65.1 West Ham 301.0 105.1 Plaistow 355.8 75.1 Hudsons 448.8 52.8 Canning Town 474.4 50.9 Tidal Basin 274.2 106.2 Custom House 684.2 38.5 26 Births.—The number of births registered during the year was 8,730 (4,515 males and 4,215 females), being 484 less than the previous year and 428 less than the average number during the last 10 years. The birth.rate for the year was 28.0 per 1,000, while the average birth.rate during the 10 years 1899.1908 was 32.2 per 1,000. Distributed to the various wards of the Borough the births were as follows :— Ward. Males. Females. Total births. Rate per 1,000 population. New Town 250 212 462 23.0 Forest Gate 216 198 414 19.0 High Street 316 317 633 29.6 Broadway 206 195 401 23.0 Park 156 166 322 19.0 Upton 166 158 324 17.0 West Ham 517 493 1,010 27.4 Plaistow 564 527 1,091 32.0 Hudsons 565 463 1,028 34.4 Canning Town 434 428 862 29.9 Tidal Basin 627 592 1,219 34.7 Custom House 498 466 964 31.4 Illegitimate Births.—131, or 1.5 per cent. of the above, were illegitimate births. 27 Deaths.—The number of deaths registered in the Borough during the year was 3,469, including the following deaths in public institutions within the district Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Plaistow Fever Hospital 4 69 West Ham Hospital 7 45 St. Mary's Hospital 16 39 Seamen's Branch Hospital — 35 Plaistow Maternity Charity 5 5 Medical Mission Hospital 4 15 Poplar Branch Workhouse — 24 Other Institutions — 19 Non.residents registered in the district 6 88 The 3,469 deaths do not include the under.mentioned deaths in public institutions outside the district:— Under 1 year. One year and upwards. Workhouse and Infirmary 40 638 Borough Asylum — 63 Dagenham Small.pox Hospital — — Residents dying in London Institutions. 50 269 28 After the suitable adjustments rendered necessary by the foregoing tables have been made, the net deaths of the Borough numbered 4,435 (2,285 males and 2,150 females), being 71 more than the previous year and 297 below the average for the last ten years. This makes an annual death.rate for the year of 14.2 per 1,000, or 2.4 below the average death.rate during the ten years 1899.1908, which was 16.6 per 1,000. Corrected for age and sex distribution, the annual death.rate becomes 15.1 per 1,000, the factor for correction being 1.0693. Both the foregoing birth.rate and death.rate, as well as the subsequent rates, have been calculated from a population estimated at the middle of the year to be 311,629, in obtaining which estimate regard has been had, firstly, to the natural increase of population (births over deaths), which in the aggregate amounted to 4,295 ; and, secondly, to the number of houses finally passed by the Borough Engineer for occupation during the previous twelve months. The number of houses completed and passed by the Borough Engineer's Staff during 1909 were as follows :— New Town — West Ham 13 Forest Gate 1 Plaistow 2 High Street — Hudsons 26 Broadway — Canning Town 12 Park 18 Tidal Basin 5 Upton 5 Custom House 37 WARD MORTALITY STATISTICS. The same method has been adopted in estimating the populations of the various Wards of the Borough, and in considering the following table in which the deaths are distributed to the several wards, it must be distinctly borne in mind that such estimates can be, at best, 29 only approximate, and the rates founded thereon liable to wide correction hereafter.

In the following tables I append particulars as far as possible relating to each disease separately—both notifiable and non.notifiable epidemic diseases. In 30 the case of the latter, however, the reported cases are necessarily. inexact, as the numbers are chiefly obtained from the School Attendance Officers, who are unable in many cases to verify by medical certificate the nature of the illness alleged to be the cause of absence from School.

A copy of the said Agreement is appended as follows:— Memorandum of Agreement made the day of 1909 BETWEEN THE MAYOR ALDERMEN AND BURGESSES OF THE COUNTY BOROUGH OF WEST HAM acting as the Urban Sanitary Authority of the said County Borough (hereinafter referred to as the Corporation) of the one part and (hereinafter referred to as "The Council") of the other part. WHEREAS the Corporation have erected at Dagenham in the Rural District of Romford in the County of Essex a Hospital for the reception and treatment of Small-pox Patients. AND WHEREAS the Council and several other Sanitary Authorities of Districts adjoining or in the neighbourhood of the said County Borough have requested the Corporation to receive the Small-pox cases arising in the District of the Council and in the said adjoining Districts and thereby to avoid the necessity and expense of providing and maintaining separate Hospitals and the Corporation are willing to receive cases of Small-pox arising in the District of the Council for the consideration and upon the terms and conditions hereinafter appearing. NOW therefore it is agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows that is to say:— 1. The Corporation will during the pendency of this Agreement admit into Dagenham Hospital all cases of Small-pox 32 arising in the District of the Council notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the Corporation (on forms supplied by the Corporation) and sent to the Hospital by order of the Council or of the Medical Officer of the Council or of a Justice under the provisions of Section 124 of the Public Health Act 1875 with the consent required by that Section and the Corporation will provide for the treatment and maintenance of Patients coming from the District of the Council in all respects on an equality with those admitted into the Hospital from the County Borough or the other Districts above referred to. 2. The Council will in consideration of the reception treatment and maintenance of the Patients coming from their District as above mentioned make to the Corporation the following payments: Firstly in respect of the upkeep of the Hospital the annual sum of £1 10s. for every thousand of the estimated population of the District of the Council which said annual sum shall be fixed according to the current estimate of the Registrar-General for the middle of each year. If no estimate is made by the RegistrarGeneral then the said annual sum shall be fixed according to the population as estimated and agreed between the Medical Officer of Health of the said Council and the Medical Officer of Health for West Ham. The term upkeep shall include the actual and necessary cost to the Corporation of keeping and maintaining the said Hospital ready at all times for the reception and treatment of Patients. The first payment under this Clause in respect of upkeep shall be made on the estimate for the middle of the year 1910. A.nd Secondly the Council will further pay to the Corporation the actual cost of the maintenance of the Patients sent by the Council and the term maintenance shall be understood to mean the additional expenditure 33 to which the Corporation are put over and above the ordinary upkeep of the Hospital by reason of the presence of Patients within the Hospital and for such time after an epidemic outbreak as is necessary to reduce the staff to its normal limit. The actual cost of the maintenance of all the Patients sent by the Council the other subscribing Authorities and the Corporation shall be ascertained on the 31st day of March and the 30th day of September in every year and such cost of maintenance shall be arrived at in the following way: The number of days during which each of the said Patients remained in the Hospital during the previous six months shall be added together the actual cost of maintenance shall be divided by the aggregate number of such days and the amount thus obtained shall be deemed to be the cost of keeping a Patient for one day during the half-year to which the account relates. The sum which the Council shall pay to the Corporation in respect of maintenance shall be arrived at by multiplying the said cost of keeping a Patient for one day by the total number of days that all Patients sent by the Council shall in the aggregate have remained in the Hospital during the said six months. Thirdly the Council shall pay the reasonable charges of the Corporation in respect of the conveyance of Patients to or from the Hospital (should the Corporation at any time undertake such conveyance) the provision of suitable clothing for them or their funerals or burials or the obtaining of any Magistrate's Order which may be necessary in connection with such burial. 3. The Corporation shall within 21 days after the 31st day of March and the 30th day of September in each year transmit to the Clerk of the Council an account showing the amount due for upkeep and an account showing in 34 respect of the Patients received into the Hospital from the District of the Council: (a) The names of the Patients. (b) The number of days during such half-year each Patient has remained in the Hospital. (c) The amount due in respect of maintenance. (d) The expenses (if any) incurred by the Corporation under the concluding paragraph of Clause 2 hereof and (e) The total amount accordingly due from the Council and the Council will within one month after the receipt of this account duly satisfy and discharge the same by payment to the Corporation. • 4. This Agreement shall not be construed as conferring upon the Council or their Medical Officer of Health or any Nominee or Agent of the Council any authority or voice in the management or administration of the Hospital or in the appropriation or expenditure of any monies paid by the Council or in the method of treatment or maintenance of any Patient admitted from the Council's District but in all respects the Hospital and the distribution of the funds provided therefor shall be under the sole control and government of the Corporation and their Medical Officer of Health Agents and servants without any interference on the part of the Council but a duly authorised officer of the Council may during a period of 14 days after the delivery of the Account referred to in Clause 3 hereof inspect the Books and Accounts of the Corporation 35 relating thereto by making an appointment for this purpose with the Treasurer of the Corporation. 5. This Agreement shall commence as from the 30th day of September 1909 and shall remain in force until the 29th day of September 1914 subject to the right of either party to terminate it on the 29th day of September in any year by giving to the other six months previous notice in writing. IN WITNESS whereof the said Corporation and the said Council have caused their respective Common Seals to be hereunto affixed the day and year first above written. The Common Seal of the said Corporation was hereunto affixed in the presence of Mayor. Town Clerk. The Common Seal of the said Council was hereunto affixed in the presence of Chairman. Clerk. c 2 36 Scarlet Fever.—This disease was again very prevalent during the year. 1,618 cases were notified, being 294 more than occurred in 1908, equivalent to an attack-rate of 5.19 per 1,000. 54 deaths occurred, making an annual death-rate of 0.17 per 1,000 the average death-rate for the past 10 years having been 0.11 per 1,000. Of the notified cases 1,004, or 62 per cent., were removed to the Plaistow Fever Hospital, an increase of 10 per cent. on the previous year. Of these 58 cases were subsequently transferred to the Convalescent Shelter in Manor Road, where the average duration of residence amounted to 27 days, and on the closing of the Shelter on 12th March, 453 cases were transferred to the New Convalescent Home at Harold Wood, where the average duration of stay amounted to 30 days. The mixed and other cases received into the Plaistow Hospital during the year were the following:—Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria 12, Diphtheria and Measles 8, Diphtheria and Nephritis 1, re-admitted Diphtheria cases 4, Scarlet Fever and Ringworm 1, Laryngeal Croup 1, Measles 7, Suspected Typhus 1, Erysipelas 1, Glanders 1, Cutaneous Anthrax 1, Puerperal Fever 1, Mumps 1, Chicken-pox 1, making a total of 41. As a means of noting the epidemic character of Scarlet Fever I have prepared a chart showing the variation above or below the monthly average of notifications for each month since the notification of Infectious Diseases Clauses came into operation. The average number of notifications for each month during the whole period were as follows:—January 98, February 78, March 80, April 87, May 90, June 95, July 102, August 101, September 135, October 168, November 130, December 107. Diphtheria.—The numberof cases of this disease notified during 1909 was 472, being the smallest number notified in any one year 37 since 1894. The attack-rate was 1.51 per 1,000, the average attackrate during the past 10 years being 2.96 per 1,000. Forty-five deaths occurred from Diphtheria, equal to an annual death-rate of 0.14 per 1,000, the average death-rate during the past 10 years being 0.37 per 1,000. The fatality or ratio of deaths to attacks was 9 per cent., while in the year 1891 it was 30 per cent. Of the 472 cases notified, 339, or 71 per cent., were removed to the Plaistow Fever Hospital. Enteric Fever has fortunately been diminishing in number during recent years in West Ham, as in the rest of the country, and last year the Borough was exceptionally free from the disease. No serious outbreak occurred. Altogether 68 cases were notified, equivalent to an annual attack-rate of 0.21 per 1,000, the average attack-rate during the past 10 years being 1.12 per 1,000. 8 deaths occurred, making an annual death-rate of 0.02 per 1,000, the average death-rate during the past 10 years being 0.18 per 1,000. Of the 68 notified cases, 51, or 75 per cent., were removed to Plaistow Hospital. Measles.—This disease was dealt with very freely in the annual report for 1908, and it is only necessary here to say that the epidemic prevalence of that year was continued in 1909 up to the middle of the year. 1,082 cases, nearly half of which occurred during the first two months of the year, were reported by the School Attendance Officers. 217 cases proved fatal, making an annual deathrate of 0.69 per 1,000, the average death-rate during the 10 previous years being 0.55 per 1,000. The southern part of the Borough was most severely attacked, and as a means of checking the spread of the disease, Canning Town Infants' School was closed from February 22nd to March 8th. 38 Whooping Cough.—This disease, which frequently becomes epidemic when Measles is prevalent, and also often occurs as a sequela of that affection, was prevalent during 1909. 310 cases were brought to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, and 184 died, making an annual death-rate of 0.59 per 1,000, the average death-rate for the past 10 years being 0.43 per 1,000. Diarrhoea.—Epidemic Diarrhoea, which is always responsible for the greater part of the zymotic death-rate, and generally accounts for a considerable share in the death-roll in young children, showed an exceptionally slight incidence of attack both in West Ham and the whole country, as may be judged from the small number of deaths. In West Ham 172 deaths occurred, equal to an annual death-rate of 0.55 per 1,000, the average death-rate for the past 10 years being l.56 per 1,000. Bronchitis (Acute and Chronic) caused 456 deaths, or a deathrate of 1.46 per 1,000, the average rate for the past ten years being 1.62 per 1,000, while the deaths from Pneumonia numbered 420, equal to a death-rate of 1.34 per 1,000, as compared with an average rate of 1.32 per 1,000 during the past decade. Heart Diseases were responsible for 277 deaths, giving a death-rate of 0.88 per 1,000, the ten years' average rate being 0.99 per 1,000. Cancer, in which term is included all forms of malignant growths, showed an increase in fatality, 225 deaths being recorded, equal to a death-rate of 0.72 per 1,000, as compared with a ten years' average rate of 0.70 per 1,000. Tubercular Diseases.—The deaths from Phthisis, or tubercular disease of the lung, have already been reported as numbering 367. In addition to these, 138 deaths occurred from tubercular diseases other than Phthisis, equal to a death-rate of 0.44 per 1,000, the ten years' average being 0.60 per 1,000. 39 Puerperal Fever.—Ten cases of this disease were notified during the year, and three proved fatal, giving a case mortality of 30 per cent. The attack rate (0.03 per 1,000) was below the average rate for the previous ten years (0.05 per 1,000), while the death-rate (0.009 per 1,000) was much below the average for ten years (0.03 per 1,000). Midwives Act, 1902.—The Midwives' Roll for 1909 contained the names of 358 Certified Midwives residing in West Ham, an increase of 165 on the names on the Roll for the previous year, which numbered 193. Only 52 midwives sent in notice of their intention to practice during the year in accordance with Section 10 of the Act. 269 records of sending for medical aid were received from 46 midwives, and the causes which induced them to require assistance are detailed as under:— Prolonged second stage 41 Premature Birth 30 Feeble Baby 25 Rupture or laceration of perinæum 22 Unsatisfactory condition during labour 10 „ „ after labour 11 Retained placenta 13 Adherent membranes 1 Ante-partum hæmorrhage 12 Post-partum hæmorrhage 14 Baby born before arrival 3 Still-birth 14 Death of Infant 3 Rise of temperature 17 Acute pain 2 Cessation of pain 1 Obstructed labour 2 Deformity 1 40 Rigor 1 Fit 2 Chorea 1 Quick Pulse 3 (Edema of Legs and Vulva 1 Insomnia 1 Miscarriage 1 Chest Trouble 1 Transverse Presentation 6 Face „ 4 Hand „ 1 Breech „ 7 Mal „ 2 Prolapse of Funis 2 Vomiting 1 Asphyxia of Infant 9 Illness of Infant 2 Icterus Neonatorum 1 Hare Lip and Cleft Palate 1 Of the total 8,370 births registered in the Borough, 4,118 were attended by certified midwives attached to the Institutions of the Plaistow Maternity Charity— 2,618 were attended from Howard's Road 1,500 „ „ „ Lansdowne Road 932 births were attended by Certified Midwives in private practice, of whom 11 qualified for certification on the Midwives' Roll by examination and 12 were enrolled by reason of their having been in active practice prior to the passing of the Act. Infant Mortality.—Much has been done of recent years to inspire interest in the question of providing the best means of combating with the great waste of infant life, and although the recent summers have been very favourable to the newly born, there is little doubt some of the improvement which has taken place in the infant mortality rate has been the result of painstaking visitation and the steady infusion of knowledge. 41 Infant mortality is usually recorded in comparison with the number of births. The total number of infants who died before they reached the age of one year during 1909 was 1,078, equal to an infant death-rate of 123 per 1,000 births. The rate during the past 10 years was 159 per 1,000 births. Nearly one-fifth of these infants died within a week of birth, and one-third died within a month. Notification of Births Act, 1907.—The adoption of this Act by the Council on 14th January, 1908, received the sanction of the Local Government Board and came into operation in the Borough on 9th March, 1908. The Act provides for the notification in writing of every birth, whether still-born or otherwise, to the Medical Officer of Health within 36 hours of its occurrence by the father if he is actually residing in the house or by any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within 6 hours after the birth. The Act also provides for the inspection by the Registrars of Births and Deaths of the register kept or notifications received, and has been of much assistance to the Registrars in enabling them to check false information and false addresses. Every medical practitioner and midwife is supplied with prepaid post-cards as required by the Act, and the following are the figures for the year:— Actual number of births received 7,590 Duplicate notifications 24 Still births 213 Notifications of births which belonged to other districts 99 336 Net West Ham births notified 7,254 42 Of the total 8,730 births registered in the year 131 were illegitimate, and of the total infant deaths 75 were illegitimate, so that the infantile mortality among the illegitimate children was 572 per 1,000 births, while that among the legitimate children was only 117 per 1,000 births. Factory and Workshops Act, 1901.—Section 132 provides that the Medical Officer of Health of every district council shall, in his annual report to them, report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State.

D 2 52 Changes in Staff.—On 1st April, 1909, the Council granted a retiring allowance to Mr. William Evans, Senior Inspector of Nuisances, after 30 years' faithful service, and the Avhole staff deeply regretted his death which occurred on 24th July. To fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Evans' retirement the Council appointed Mr. Geo. H. Wilson, an Inspector of Nuisances. Mr. Wilson had previously acted for nine years as Inspector under the Shop Hours Act, and to fill the vacancy thus caused Mr. Ed. G. Simmons was appointed. In September, Miss M. G. Bhose, Lady Inspector of Nuisances, resigned her office, and Miss Mary Monkhouse was appointed in her place. 53 APPENDIX. Pages. 1. Weekly Notifications of Infectious Disease 54, 55 2.
