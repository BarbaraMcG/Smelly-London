Statistics The birth rate was very slightly lower, and the general death rate marginally higher than in 1967. The infant mortality rate was below that for the country as a whole, but greater than usual for Croydon, because the death rate for illegitimate babies was relatively high. One mother died in childbirth, but there was no death associated with abortion. Fewer persons died from cancer of the lung or from pulmonary tuberculosis than in 1967. Health Centres The Department of Health and Social Security approved schemes to adapt the Parkway Clinic at New Addington, and a new building in South Norwood. The latter proposal was the subject of a public meeting arranged by the local ratepayers association, at which the whole concept of health centres and the special needs of the area were explained by the family doctors and the local health authority. These talks and the discussion which followed cleared many misunderstandings and misgivings of potential patients. It was an excellent example of the importance of proper communication and public participation. 6 Domiciliary Midwifery Home confinements fell to 25% of all Croydon births. The introduction of schemes for early discharge of mothers from maternity units in recent years has steadily diminished the numbers of mothers having their babies born at home. Insofar as this allows the admission of all high risk cases to hospital it is obviously to be supported, but the gradual replacement of domiciliary midwifery by maternity nursing raises staffing problems. Health Visiting Recruitment continued to improve with the policy of secondment for (raining. The experiment of using clinic nurses and assistants for tasks not requiring trained Health Visitors was so successful that authority for an appropriate permanent establishment was given. The publication of the report on Social Workers, caused some concern to Health Visitors about the future scope of their work The developing pattern of attachment to general practice, and the increasing need for health education at group and personal level for all sections of the community, imply a greater demand for Health Visitors than at any time since the conquest of infant mortality. Care of Children Under 5 Years of Age New legislation covering the registration of child minders imposed fresh responsibilities. The popularity of private nursery groups continued to increase. There is a growing demand for facilities for pre-school children particularly from mothers living in tall blocks of flats. Nursery schools or nursery classes would meet the needs of the majority, leaving day nursery places for mothers compelled to work as the sole wage earner of the family, and for handicapped children. Despite the Corporation's scheme of assisted daily minders, it was not possible to cope with all demands from mothers entitled to day nursery places, and an application was made to the Department of Health for authority and grant to build a day nursery in Thornton Heath, for 50 children. Mental Health The major event was the completion of the new Coldharbour School. This provides 60 places for children of school age, deemed unable to benefit from attendance at an ordinary school, 24 places for similar children of pre-school age, and 24 places for very severely handicapped children. It replaced the adapted house on the same site, previously used as the Junior Training Centre, and anticipates in design and name the transfer of these facilities to the Education authority. Only one extra home was added during the year to the Group Units. Several properties were considered, but planning difficulties and high conversion costs could not be overcome. An approach was made to the Housing Committee about the inclusion of premises in a housing project, as the use 7 of standard housing accommodation with very minor alterations seems feasible. This is being pursued but comes unfortunately at a time when few large scale housing developments are being planned. The need for more residential places was a constant problem. Clean Air The programme of an additional smoke control area every year was maintained. As an outer London borough with initially less smoke pollution than the central districts, our anticipated completion date for the whole of Croydon is later than that of the majority. Nevertheless substantial progress has been made in our northern more densely populated wards, with unquestionable benefit. A proposal of the Greater London Council to build a refuse incinerator in Sutton, immediately on the western boundary of the borough was therefore viewed with some concern. The problems of refuse disposal are understood, but the burning of 1,200 tons or more a day in a single incinerator raised possibilities of serious air pollution. No comparable plant was operating in this country, and reports were obtained from Holland and France. A plant in Paris was inspected and reassuring reports were received. 'As a choice between two evils, it was decided that with adequate safeguards this method of refuse disposal could be accepted. Fluoridation of Water Supplies Owing to the number of different sources of supply and the mixing of water from these separate sources to meet varying demands, there would be added technical difficulties and expense if Croydon attempted fluoridation in advance of adjoining areas. Although accepting the general principle the Corporation proposed no action pending agreement of other authorities. Future Developments It is clear that far reaching changes in the administration of the health services are now probable. Close co-operation has been achieved in Croydon during the last 20 years especially in the former county borough area. This has been shown to be possible, with the support of the Regional Hospital Board, when the Hospital Management Committee has a catchment area roughly co-terminous with the Local Health Authority dealing with personal health services. Consequently the proposals of the "Green paper" which disregarded this fact were viewed with much concern. The alternative now emerging of a two tier structure retaining a second level authority representing a joint hospital and local authority unit, would use advantages gained in areas where success has been achieved under existing legislation. Staff Problems of recruitment were eased by the Council's policy of secondment for training, and the establishment of local training courses, but difficulties persisted, especially in the Public Health Inspectors section. Miss Oakley the first Principal Nursing Officer appointed to this post retired 8 after a period of extended service, and was succeeded by Miss Hayward. Changes in the duties and deployment of members of the Health Visiting, Nursing and Midwifery staff have in recent years been far reaching, and clearly there are still more to come. The need for the supervising and coordinating post of Principal Nursing Officer has been established beyond doubt In thanking the staff of the department for their continued loyal support I am pleased to mention several examples of individual efforts to increase efficiency in aspects of work generally regarded as humdrum routine jobs. These stemmed from attendances at refresher courses, and the resulting awareness of challenge and opportunity must more than repay training costs whether calculated in terms of money or job satisfaction. The difficulties of the Committee in a period of financial stringency are understood, and your trust in the advice given by members of the department was a great incentive to the optimum use of all available resources, and much appreciated. 1 am Yours faithfully, S.L. WRIGHT, Medical Officer of Health and Principal School Medical Officer.

The condition was subsequently shown to be due to injury, and another year free from any case of this infection was thus recorded. Although an inter-epidemic year for measles, over 400 cases were notified, due to a minor outbreak during the summer months. Notifications of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were fewer than in 1967 and the number of deaths markedly reduced. For detailed tables of communicable diseases see Appendix page 126. 16 THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF TUBERCULOSIS Dr. R.H.J. Fanthorpe, M.D., M.R.C.P. Chest Physician Measures for the prevention and treatuent of Tuberculosis are directed from the Chest Clinic and the results during 1968 may be regarded as satisfactory. Incidence 76 cases of Respiratory Tuberculosis and 17 cases of Non-Respiratory Tuberculosis were notified on Form A during 1968 (Table 1 - Formal Notifications). Of these 61 males and 15 females were Respiratory cases and 8 males and 9 females were Non-Respiratory. In addition 37 Respiratory cases and 5 Non-Respiratory cases came to our notice as new cases otherwise thai by notification. The total number of new cases of Tuberculosis coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health during the year 1968 by notification or otherwise was 135. 113 of these were cases of Respiratory Tuberculosis; 83 in males and 30 in females. There were no cases of Non-Respiratory Tuberculosis among children under 15 years. The number of cases in adults was 17. The incidence rate of Tuberculosis, all forms, was 0.40 per 1,000 of the population, for Respiratory Tuberculosis 0.34 and for Non-Respiratory Tubex losis 0.06 per 1,000 population. The notification rate was 0.28 per 1,000. Notification Register Number of cases of Tuberculosis remaining on the Notification Register on 31st December, 1968: RESPIRATORY NON-RESPIRATORY Males Females Total Males Females Total Total Caseil 936 636 1,572 62 90 152 1,724 In 1968 the death-rate from all forms of Tuberculosis was 0.04 per 1,000 population. The rate from Respiratory Tuberculosis was 0.04 and the rate for NonRespiratory 0.00. In 1968 the total number of deaths was 15. All but 1 of the deaths occurrs in the age groups 45 years and over. There was no death in children of school age. Notifications: See Appendix page 132. 17 Deaths from Non-Respiratory Tuberculosis During 1968 3 deaths were certified to be due to Non-Respiratory Tuberculosis. Co-ordination with the Health Department During the year 11 children were referred by the School Health Service of the Public Health Department. Extra Nourishment Provision of special nourishment in the form of milk was granted to 42 selected cases for varying periods during the year and 32 cases were in receipt of extra nourishment at the end of the year. The Chest Clinic and Home Visiting 1,632 new cases were examined during the year. 74 were found to be definitely tuberculosis. The total number of attendances for examination at the Chest Clinic was 16,397. The Clinic doctors paid 226 home visits and the Tuberculosis Visitors 3,284 visits for Clinic purposes. In addition the Tuberculosis Visitors made 134 primary visits for the purposes of the Notification Register. There were also 1,115 unsuccessful visits. The General Practitioner Miniature X-Ray Service continues to function in a satisfactory way and is well used by local practitioners. The results of this service are summarised below:â€” Number of miniature films taken 4,237 Number of patients recalled for examination and large film 421 Number of active cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis found 17 Number of cases of lung cancer found 23 Contact Examination During 1968, 455 persons were examinaed for the first time as contacts of notified cases of Tuberculosis. Of these contacts, 5 were found to be tuberculous. This is equal to a Tuberculosis rate per ,1,000 contacts of 11 compared with 0.40 per 1,000 of the general population. In addition there was 1 found to be tuberculous who had been under observation from previous years. 18 B.C.G. Vaccination The use of B.C.G. vaccination for contacts has been continued during 1968 and resrular sessions were held at the Clinic for this purpose. 328 contacts were successfully vaccinated during the year. In addition 6 nurses and domestics were successfully vaccinated, and 46 babies of tuberculous parents were vaccinated in hospital during the neonatal period. B.C.G. Vaccination for School Leavers Total number of children skin tested 4,095 Number found to be negative 3,083 Number vaccinated with B.C.G 3,067 MASS RADIOGRAPHY 1968 The following figures kindly supplied by the Medical Director of the Surrey Area of the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board Mass Radiography Service include all attendances at public and private sessions:â€” No. of Persons Examined Significant Pulmonary Tuberculosis Primary Carcinoma of Lung Male 17,484 10 15 Female 13,866 5 1 TOTAL 31,350 15 16 Croydon and New Addington General Practitioner Chest X-Ray Service No. of Persons Examined Significant Pulmonary Tuberculosis P rimary Carcinoma of Lung Male 460 1 6 Female 376 - 1 TOTAL 836 1 7 19 AFTER-CARE OF TOE TUBERCULOUS PATIENT As in previous years, the tuberculous patient has been followed up not only at the Chest Clinics but with home visits. Help and advice have again been given on finances and employment as well as on home and personal problems. The Croydon Care Committee has given invaluable help for some years past, but in 1968 grants have had to be curtailed owing to lack of funds. However, although unable to pay for holidays for needy patients and their families, the Committee has continued to give help with extra fuel and special needs, and in a year of rising costs this has been most helpful to patients living on a low income. At Christmas the Care Committee issued grocery vouchers to the value of Â£180 for distribution amongst Croydon and Purley Chest Clinic Patients. Statutory benefits have been similar to those existing last year except for an increase in the Supplementary grants. The allowance from the Public Health Department for milk remains at Â£525, and this money has been used to provide about 32 frail tuberculous patients with 1 pint of free milk daily. Despite the efforts of the Disablement Resettlement Officer, it is still difficult for the tuberculous patient, who is only fit for light work, to obtain suitable employment. In certain cases arrangements have been made through the Welfare Officer for the Handicapped for these patients to attend Waylands Occupation Centre, and they may move on later to the Industrial Unit. There have been a variety of personal and home problems over the past year, and often help was needed so that difficulties did not retard the patient's progress. The Home Help Service, Housing Department, District Nurses and Children's Department have given excellent co-operation when required, and there is no doubt that the liaison of all concerned, either directly or indirectly, in the after-care of the tuberculous patient has again proved to be very helpful. 20 OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY The Chest Clinic Occupational Therapy Department has been kept busy throughout 1968. A steady number of new patients were visited,most of whom are now doing Occupational Therapy in their homes, and others who were well enough to cope were passed on to Waylands. This year has been rather less productive than of late as a greater number of the patients were more frail and poorly, and in these cases we concentrated on lighter and less tiring occupations. However, we have had a very good year in some departments and have made and sold large numbers of mosaic plant pots and other mosaic articles as well as the usual caneworl and toys. All the patients are enthusiastic about their work and find the demand for their products very satisfying. Our sales were very encouraging again and there was a continuous demand for the goods in the showcase throughout the year. We did not hold our Annual Saie in December but some craftwork was taken to Purley Hospital before Christmas and everything sold quite quickly. VENEREAL DISEASES It has always been difficult to assess local trends. Returns are needed from all clinics in the London and Surrey areas, classified according to places of residence of patients, and some have not been forthcoming for 1968. From the figures received from the Croydon General Hospital, new cases of Syphilis were fewer than in 1967, but there were more cases of Gonorrhoea and of non-specific urethritis. Although the total returns to date show a reduction against the general background of continuing national increases, one hesitates to assume success in efforts to limit the spread of venereal diseases in Croydon. Quarterly returns for the current year support the view that increased prevalence is the overall tendency. For detailed figures see Appendix page 137. PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICE Very considerable use has been made of the facilities for bacteriological and other laboratory examinations of public health nature. I take this opportunity to thank Dr. W.R.G. Thomas, Consultant Bacteriologist at Mayday Hospital for his ready assistance and most helpful advice which have been available at all times. For detailed figures, see Appendix page 129. PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES UNDER THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT 23 CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN Ante-Natal and Post-Natal Clinics Existing arrangements of a unified hospital and local authority obstetric service for the former County Borough area continued. There was no progress in the approach to Redhill Hospital for more co-ordination of hospital and domiciliary maternity services, nor was it possible to make arrangements for their pupil midwives to receive Part II training in that part of the London Borough area covered by Redhill Hospital. Routine meetings of the Maternity Liaison Committee continued. At the ante-natal clinics a total of 5,891 mothers attended during the year. 954 mothers attended the post-natal clinic. At relaxation and mothercraft classes 901 mothers made 3,948 attendances. 3,881 patients had an initial blood test. 42 were found to have 4h. antibodies. 41 were referred to the special clinic for venereal diseases. Care of Premature Babies Arrangements for the supervision of premature babies after discharge from hospital were extended to the whole borough within the catchment area of Mayday Hospital. These include routine estimations of haemoglobin with reference back to the hospital of any infant found to have less than 60%. For detailed figures see Appendix page 104. Phenylketonuria During 1968 all babies born in the borough or normally resident there have been screened for phenylketonuria by having either a Guthrie test or a urine test. It is hoped that early in the new year all babies born in the borough, whether at home or in hospital, will have a Guthrie test. It was as a result of a Guthrie test that one case of phenylketonuria v/as discovered, a true diagnosis was made and treatment started early in the disease. The baby is currently under treatment and is progressing well. 24 Care of the Unmarried Mother Three voluntary organisations act as agents of the Corporation. Grants are made to them to cover the work of their social welfare officers and the costs of sending mothers to mother and baby homes. These arrangements continue schemes in operation in the former constituent authority areas. The Southwark Catholic Children's Society covering the whole London Borough; the Croydon Association for Moral Welfare the former County Borough: and the Southwark Diocesan Association the former Coulsdon and Purley areas. Merging the work of the two latter organisations was possible but would have resulted in a substantial loss of voluntary contributions. No administrative difficulties arose during the year under review. The following figures apply only in regard to cases dealt with by Croydon Association for Moral Welfare. During the year under'review:â€” 294 cases were dealt with by the social workers. 42 girls were admitted to mother and baby homes. 50 girls were financially assisted by the Local Authority. Ages of the younger mothers when they applied for help. 12 years old - 13 " " 1 14 " " 8 15 " "8 16 " " 17 17 " " 37 18 " " 28 Age when baby was born 12 years old - 13 " " - 14 " " 4 15 " " 9 16 " " 18 17 " " 33 18 " " 23 19 " " 9 Midwives Acts 1902-51 The number of midwives who notified their intention to practice as midwives within the Borough (including those in hospitals) and who were practising at the end of the year was 105. All held the certificate of the Central Midwives' Board. The Medical Supervisor of Midwives visits midwives in private practice and nursing homes, and the superintendent Municipal Midwife carries out these duties for the domiciliary midwives. Congenital Malformation The scheme introduced in 1963 continued unchanged, regular returns being made to the Registrar General. A total of 96 babies with congenital conditions was notified in 1968. For details see Appendix, page 105. 25 Child Health Centres The demand for these facilities which comprise education of parents, assessment supervision and immunisation of children, was unchanged. There were fewer attendances of children born in 1968 but the requests for more toddler sessions could not be met in full, owing to financial restrictions. For detailed figures see Appendix page 110. Welfare Foods and Medicaments The policy of restricting sales at Child Health Centres to National dried milk and Ministry of Food vitamin preparations was relaxed to include a vitamin A and D concentrate. Many mothers said their infants would accept only this form of A & D supplement, and could not be persuaded to take cod liver oil. Most of the former objectionable taste has been removed from the cod liver oil now available, and prejudice relates probably more to parents than to children. The dangers from lack of vitamins A & D are too real to permit any excuse for their being withheld, and with the agreement of the local Pharmaceutical Committee a clinic pack of A & D concentrate is now sold. Issue of Welfare Foods in 1968:- National Dried Milk 36,019 Cod Liver Oil 6,019 Vitamin A and D Tablets 6,857 Orange Juice 106,459 For detailed figures see Appendix page 105. 26 THE WORK OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING SERVICES Miss A. Hayward, S.R.N., S.C.M., H.V. Cert. Principal Nursing Officer. Miss L.E. Oakley, Principal Nursing Officer of Croydon retired in October, 1968 after working more than thirty years in the Public Health Service - all of it in Croydon. She had seen two Local Government reorganisations, and although the first, in 1948, had not had the same impact in Croydon as in other London Boroughs, the London Government Act,; 1964 did increase the size of the Borough, bringing new staff and services to be assimilated. Miss Oakley, who had been Superintendent Health Visitor in Croydon since 1954, was appointed as Principal Nursing Officer to the new London Borough, and using her many years of administrative experience was able to set the pattern for a unified Borough Nursing Service. Domiciliary Midwifery Service The work of the midwives in 1968 reflected the national tendency towards more hospital confinements r suiting in a general reduction in domiciliary bookings, with fewer primigravida being delivered at home. The staff continued to care for an increased number of early discharges, most of them unplanned. Domiciliary Midwives have taken blood specimens for the Guthrie Test from all babies in their care and dispatched these, together with those collected by hospital staff to St. Ebba's Hospital Laboratory. They have also been responsible for taking any repeat tests found to be necessary. The Anti-D immunoglobulin treatment for Rhesus negative patients has been started in the Borough this year. For detailed figures see page 101. Health Visiting Service The staffing situation in this branch of the service improved during the year, no doubt due in part to the Health Visitor Training Course at Croydon Technical College. Five sponsered students successfully completed their training and joined the staff in October 1968. Six more are currently training at Croydon Technical College. The amended legislation relating to child minding which became operative in November placed an increasing burden on this section of the service. The Specialist Health Visitor, who prior to November 1968 had visited Play groups and Daily Minders, became responsible for the initial assessment of all applicants. This ensured that a common standard was obtained. Health Visitors paid follow-up visits to registered daily minders and the Specialist Health Visitor, or the Deputy Superintendent Health Visitor continued to supervise the larger Playgroups. For detailed figures see page 108. 27 Home Nursing Service During the year arrangements were completed with Croydon General Hospital for an Integrated S.E.N./District Nurse Training. The first intake of pupils was in November 1968 and they will spend two weeks with the District Nurses during their first year and six weeks during their second year of training. As the hospital plans four schools a year this will become an increasing responsibility for the District Nursing Service. However, it is hoped that in due course this training will provide a pool for recruitment of Enrolled Nurses for district work. The new S.E.N./District Nurse Training has extended the close links already forged between the hospital and community nursing services. All branches of the Borough Nursing Services have appreciated the invitations extended to them by their hospital colleagues to participate in Staff Study days. For detailed figures see page 112. IMMUNISATION Regarding 75% as the minimum protection rate for the population at risk, reasonably satisfactory levels were achieved for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. It was still not possible to use computer records for this service. Instructions to involve the family doctor before vaccinating against smallpox were observed, but towards the end of the year it became clear that the number of children receiving this protection had fallen very drastically as a result of this policy. It is to be re-assessed. Vaccine giving protection against measles was issued by the Department of Health, and offered to those eligible. The case for giving measles vaccine in this country where the disease is generally mild, is by no means as clear cut as for more dangerous illnesses. The vaccine itself can produce reactions including a mild attack of a measles type illness, and these ware noted, without any worrying adverse results being reported. For tables see Appendix page 130. 28 CONVALESCENCE The Corporation accepts financial responsibility for convalescence recommended by general practitioners. Each patient recommended must have had a definite illness or accident and must go to a recognised Convalescent Home. The Corporation recovers part or all the cost according to the income of the patient and in accordance with a definite assessment scale. Certain patients may receive convalescent treatment free, including Retirement Pensioners. Every effort is made to suit the patient to the particular Home, as different Homes cater for different age groups and different kinds of medical or surgical conditions. During the year 37 cases were so dealt with, 28 women and 9 men. There were in addition, 22 cases where the patients cancelled their applications after the arrangements had been made. HOME HELP SERVICE Miss J.E. Heath, Principal Home Help Organiser. â€¢ "It befits those happy at home to remain there" Latin proverb. A home is one of the essential aspects of human life particularly for the very young and the very old. To all ages it means a secure and familiar environment, but the maintenance of a home requires skill and physical energy. When energy fails through illness or old age, a substitute must be found. One present day source of substitute energy is the Home Help Service. Unfortunately apart from the move to Taberner House, 1968 was not an inspired year for the Croydon Home Help Service. The training scheme for Home Helps which aroused considerable interest in several parts of the country had a temporary set-back. Shortage of District Home Help Organisers necessitated the employment of the Tutor Organiser for relief duties. Happily by December three appointments were made and the training scheme became fully operational by January 1969. "Waiting for Seebohm" became a speculative pastime throughout the country, particularly amongst Home Help Organisers. Home Helps have always formed part of the domiciliary health team, and in the formative years of the Service much of the statutory social work was performed by Public Health Staff Today the vast pattern of social work is much more intricate and complicated and the recommendation that the Home Help Service should form part of the Social Services was not unexpected. There are however many points still to be debated, not the least being the recruitment of suitable women for Home Help work. As the number of recruits diminishes, more stringent reviews of priorities are required, and the question must be answered, which must take precedence, medical or social need? 29 The work of a Home Help changes with the introduction of more mechanical aids. In this field there may well be an unexplored avenue for helping the aged and handicapped to perform more tasks for themselves. Relating the cost and availability of staff to the cost of provision of modern equipment could prove an interesting equation. The conception that a Home Help's duties should consist mainly of all the unpleasant tedious tasks in the home should be dispelled as soon as possible. No emergency request for the Service should be cut to a bare minimum number of hours because of a public misinterpretation that the Service is provided to polish floors and furniture every week. Some recruits to the Service are lost, not because of the difficulties and responsibilities of the work (in fact most Home Helps respond to a challenge) but because they do not get "job satisfaction". They rightly object to being considered itinerant floor cleaners. Many women enter the Home Help Service not simply for the sake of earning some pin money but from a real public spirited desire to bring comfort and inspire hope and confidence amongst sick and aged people. The Home Helps' training programme nurtures and encourages this spirit and demonstrates through the practical work the simplest way to tackle the many and varied tasks concerned with homemaking. For detailed figures see Appendix page 117. 30 HEALTH EDUCATION AND HOME SAFETY Miss D.S. Elliott, S.R.N., H.V. Cert., Dip. H.E. Principal Health Education Officer 1968 was a turbulent year of movement and adjustment to Taberner House, the acquisition of basic furniture and equipment and staff changes. By December the Health Education Section had settled down well with the exception of persistent and time-wasting difficulties with car parking and the loading and unloading of equipment. The Library now extensively used by all sections of the Health Department is growing slowly and efforts will be made to increase its resources during the coming financial year. Considerable time is spent in helping Public Health, Nursing and Teaching Staffs and Students of different disciplines with references, materials and the arrangement of their educational work. The quality and quantity of work among mothers in the Toddlers Clinics improved again during the year and the wide variety and range of subjects in the programmes illustrated the interest of the public and the imagination of the Staff, many of whom were newly appointed and undertook this work for the first time. The co-operation and work done by the Public Health Inspectors with Staff and Students within the organisations in the Borough and in Clinic Groups was much appreciated. The general public has remarkably little knowledge of the breadth and depth of Public Health Services. Mental Health The Health Education and Mental Health Sections worked with the Croydon Association for Mental Health and helped in the organisation of activities during Mental Health Week. Displays, some illustrating the activities and workload of the Community Mental Health Services and others illustrating topics and talking points on the promotion of good Mental Health used in various educational settings,were set up in Rees House and in a shop in St. George's Walk. They were always manned by a member of Staff from the Mental Health Section and a volunteer from the Croydon Association for Mental Health. Interest was stimulated by paintings executed by patients and loaned by Warlingham Park Hospital, and some of these were hung in the foyer of Croydon Technical College. A coffee Morning was held on the first Saturday in St. Matthew's Church Hall and two Mental Health films suitable for the general public were shown during the morning. The attendance was lower than anticipated but the discussion and questions following the films were lively and worth while. Among other activities arranged to involve many sections of the public were Church Services and Open Days at Waylands Training Centre, Warlingham Park Hospital, The Crescent Day Centre and St. Lawrence's Hospital. Films followed by 31 discussion and led by expert speakers were shown at Rees House every evening during the week. The content each evening was designed for a specific audience interested in a specific aspect of Mental Health and the week concluded with a panel on local Mental Health Services chaired by the Medical Officer of Health. Mental Health Education Panel Croydon Association of Mental Health organised a panel of professional people and lay members of the Association to ensure that Speakers on the different aspects of the care of the mentally ill and the mentally subnormal were always prepared and could be called upon when invitations to address the public were received. A record is kept of the particular aspect about which each member of the panel can speak with ease and the time of day when they can be available. In addition to their own educational programme, Health Education Staff give help and advice on teaching methods and order, make or provide visual aids for speakers. Health Education in Industry and Commerce A series of three talks was given to Trainee Manageresses at Marks & Spencers by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health and Principal Health Education Officer and a session on Mouth to Mouth Resuscitation was undertaken by a Health Education Officer for the Post Office Staff at Impact House. With the stabilisation of the Health Education Section it is hoped to extend and improve this aspect of the work. Family Planning Education for Family Planning continued during the classes for expectant parents and in many of the Toddler Clinic Discussion Groups. A Health Education Officer gave In-service Training Sessions to small groups of Health Visitors and Midwives, many of whom now take their own groups. Other In-Service Training Sessions held in the Health Education Section Assistant Medical Officers of Health (a) A lecture was given by Mr. Dermot Pierce, Ophthalmic Surgeon on "The Detection and Diagnosis of Squint in the Pre-school Child". (b) Doctor Crosse, Child Psychiatrist, continued fortnightly discussion groups on the "Early Diagnosis and Treatment of Behaviour Problems in Young Children". Dentists (a) Practical demonstrations of mouth to mouth and cardiac resuscitation. (b) A lecture and film on dental anaesthesia given by Mr. Brooks, Consultant Anaesthetist. 32 Health Visitors Monthly Staff Meetings were held and speakers on topics relating to Health Visiting were a regular feature. For example:â€” (a) Miss J. Hayes, Superintendent Health Visitor from the County Borough of Oxford a member of the Central Health Services Council, spoke about the Council's report on the future role of the Child Health Centres. (b) Mrs. Toomer from the Royal National Institute for the Blind spoke about the problems and training of blind children. Visitors to the Department Now that Health Education work is firmly established in Croydon it is interesting to note how many Colleges and Organisations ask for sessions in Croydon for their students on the subject of Health Education organisation, principals, methods and techniques. Although not fully operational because of disruption caused by the move to Taberner House, the following groups were fitted in during the year:â€” Health Visitors' Association One group of Health Visitor Fieldwork Instructors Two groups of Health Visitor Students One group of School Nurses. Croydon Hospital Three groups of Student Nurses (in addition to lectures on the social aspects of disease given at the hospital by members of the Staff) Royal College of Nursing Four groups of Health Visitor Tutors Two groups of Public Health Administrators One group of Health Visitor Students. University of Surrey and Brighton College of Technology One group of Health Visitor Students from each College. London Boroughs Training Committee Two groups of Health Visitors undertaking re-entry courses in health visiting. ; One group of Home Help Organisers. Croydon Technical College One group of Health Visitor Students (series of lectures was given in the Health Education Section on Public Health Services by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health). 33 Coloma Teachers' Training College One group of Second-year Students One group of mature Students Lambeth Health Department One group of Health Visitors and in addition Health Visitors and Health Education Officers visited from other London Boroughs and as far away as Coventry. Programmes were also arranged for two W.H.O. Fellows visiting the Health Department. When not in use the Lecture Room was loaned to other departments for showing films during in-service training sessions. Home Safety Once again two thirty-foot marquees were taken at the Ashburton Flower Show. One of these was devoted entirely to Home Safety and Health Education and the other to Dental Health Education. The Home Safety activities involved the participation of the public as much as possible and a large number of people visited the tent during the course of the afternoon. A new venture this year was to set up a Home Safety Exhibition in the Health Education Lecture Room and Work Room. A group of Student District Nurses visited the section and had talks and discussions on the topics shown in the room. As an experiment groups of children from the Parish Church Primary School were also brought into the Department. Individual groups took an interest in individual exhibits and a talk and film were shown to conclude the session. This unusual form of work was interesting to the children and stimulating to the Staff. A group of girls from Lanfranc Secondary Girls School also visited the Exhibition as part of a series of talks given in the Community Health Course. Having undertaken these one or two experiments, we hope very much to use the Health Education Lecture Room more often as an experimental classroom. The Health Education Staff worked very hard during this rather difficult year and are particularly grateful for all the help they received from members of the administrative staff and other sections of the Health Department. Without their kindness and goodwill in helping to sort out the vast amount of equipment and the early difficulties encountered on first reaching Taberner House, it would have been difficult to have undertaken so much work during the year. For details see Appendix page 115. 34 DENTAL SERVICE (MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE) W.G. Everett, L.D.S., R.C.S., (Eng.) Chief Dental Officer During the year 918 children under five years of age were dentally examined. Of these over half (52 per cent) were found to need treatment. Basing an estimate on the total number of live births in the Borough in 1965 and 1966, it is reasonable to say that there are approximately 11,400 three and four year olds in Croydon, of whom 5,900 are likely to have decayed teeth. Even allowing for the work done for these patients by the General Dental Service practitioners it is certain that efforts must continue to encourage parents to bring their children for treatment in good time. If their first acquaintance with the dentist is for the extraction of a tooth or teeth under a general anaesthetic, the memory will be very hard to remove, especially if this treatment was preceded by a period of acute pain. The three year old birthday card scheme was continued at Sanderstead clinic. During the year 222 cards were sent out and in response to these 77 children (35 per cent) attended for a routine examination. This is a welcome improvement on the number who accepted in 1966 (22 per cent) the first year of scheme. Talks were given on Dental Health Education matters to mothers in toddlers clubs and it is hoped that this sphere of activity may be increased. From the interest that is shown and the questions that are asked it is obvious that parents are keen to learn more about care of their children's teeth. A surprising number are still not aware that the Local Authority Dental Service provides free treatment for pre-school children. For detailed figures see Appendix page 118. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES Administration The Medical Officer of Health is in administrative control, and the Deputy and two Assistant Medical Officers of Health are approved for the purpose of the Mental Health Act. Dr. J.D.W. Fisher, Consultant Psychiatrist at Warlingham Park Hospital is Psychiatric Adviser to the Local Health Authority and the Medical Director of their community mental health services. Dr. B.W. Richards, Consultant Psychiatrist at St. Lawrence's Hospital continues as adviser in mental subnormality. My thanks are again due to medical colleagues both in hospitals and general practice for their help and co-operation without which the continuing successful operation and development of the mental Health services would not be possible. 35 Voluntary Associations Thanks are due to the increasing number of volunteers and voluntary organisations who have given generously of time, effort and money during the year to help the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill. The interest and concern expressed in this very practical way is tremendously encouraging and enables the scope and quality of the Mental Health Service to be greatly extended. The Croydon and District Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, The Mental After Care Association and The Guardianship Society, must be specially mentioned. Each of them has helped us for many years and continues to do so invaluably. The recently formed Croydon Association for Mental Health has been active during the year in the field of education and information on mental health matters, and was largely responsible for the successful and varied programme for "Mental Health Week" The Croydon Volunteer Aid Project under the direction of Mr. H.P. Muller goes from strength to strength, and the variety of tasks and the number of organisations and individuals concerned in the work has increased greatly over the past year. Through its residential homes the Mental After Care Association continues to help many Croydon patients, 29 of whom were resident in the Association's Homes at the end of the year. Reference is again due to the help and interest of the Croydon Guild of Social Service and to many other voluntary organisations and individuals who during the year have given willingly of time and resources to help Croydon patients. Admissions under the Mental Health Act 1959 Males Females Total Admitted informally 41 54 95 Under Section 25 (For observation) 50 46 96 Under Section 26 (For treatment) 20 33 53 Under Section 29 (For observation in emergency) 75 116 191 Under Section 60 (Hospital Order through Court) 5 1 6 Under Section 136 (Police Action) 2 5 7 Investigated but not admitted 23 50 73 216 305 521 36 In Netherne and Cane Hill Hospitals, Mental Welfare Officers were concerned with 45 Section 25 procedures, 33 Section 26 procedures, and 15 Section 29 procedures. 1967 1968 Informal Admissions 72 95 i.e. rise of 32% Emergency admissions S.29 184 191 i.e. rise of 4% Investigated but not admitted 53 73 i.e. rise of 38% Total admissions under Sectionis 329 353 i.e. rise of 7.3% Total cases dealt with 454 521 i.e. rise of 14.8% Guardianship During 1968 the Guardianship of one patient under the Local Health Authority lapsed, and the total number under Guardianship was thus reduced to 18. Training Centres (i) Junior Training Centre Coldharbour House continued in use during the best part of the year, but on the 18th November the new building came into use under the name of Coldharbour School. In the ensuing year admissions will bring the numbers attending to 108. Residential Care (i) Temporary Care In 51 instances short term care for patients was made through the hospital service, and convalescent holidays were arranged for 21 patients during the year. Temporary residential care for patients recovering from mental illness continues to be provided through the Mental After Care Association's hostel in Croydon. (ii) Long Term Care (a) Boarding Out Scheme During 1968 32 patients were found lodgings through the Scheme, 11 less than in the previous year. Of these 21 were still in lodgings at the end of tie year, 8 had moved on to other accommodation and 3 had been readmitted to hospital. Again tribute must be paid to the landladies who participate in the scheme and make it such a successful aid to the rehabilitation of patients. (b) Group Homes The 4 small group homes already established continue to run smoothly and provide accommodation for 25 residents. 37 Social Work During the year the social workers again re ceived well over a thousand requests for help from various sources. Almost half of these requests came from psychiatric sources. The other half came from other departments of the Corporation, various other social agencies, from general practitioners and the general public. The number of active cases carried has risen steadily over the year from 1166 to 1325, and this represents a high level of activity in the history of the service. Work with groups has received additional attention. Selected officers have been given training in this work, and a number of new groups have been started. Students The Training Officer with the assistance of the social work staff continued to provide practical training for student social workers from the Croydon Technical College and elsewhere. The number of regular students was increased from 12 to 14 and a number of others visited for shorter periods of work. Visitors The mental health services in Croydon continue to be of interest nationally and internationally and the flow of visitors from many different places and disciplines continued through 1967. Countries from which they came included - Australia, Costa Rica, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Hungary, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.S.A. The Unified Industrial Therapy Service 1968 was a year of consolidation. The rationalisation of the industrial contract seeking mentioned in earlier reports, whereby contracts were obtained and allocated through one Organiser/Manager, based on the Sheltered Workshop, has continued and the value of the unification policy is increasingly underlined. The Sheltered Workshop earnings increased by 33%, the Craftwork, Training and Social Centre (Waylands) by 111% and the Assessment and Rehabilitation Centre by 14%. The total income from work undertaken by or subcontracted from the three centres amounted to approximately Â£71,500 and during the year over 1,000 orders were fulfilled. The mobile work group which undertakes grass cutting and simple gardening secured contracts for several new sites and the concrete production section of the sheltered workshop had a good year - the demand for its products being so high that a quota system had to be introduced. 38 The Waylands Centre, which, when it opened in 1967 was an experiment in providing services under one roof for the physically disabled and mentally handicapped, has continued to function satisfactorily. This report deals with the section of the Centre concerned with the mentally handicapped, the remaining section being the responsibility of the Chief Welfare Officer. Links with centres run by voluntary societies, particularly the Spastics and the Guild of Social Service, were strengthened. Practical co-operation between the voluntary and statutory bodies is essential if services for the ??? abled are to be really effective and there were promising signs in 1968 that the services were dovetailing to provide a comprehensive pattern of day cen??? provision. The Industrial Advisory Panel, representing local industrialists, continued to give valuable guidance and advice and in a quite different sphere, the Croydon and District Society for Mentally Handicapped Children maintain their traditionally enthusiastic support of the Council's policies. The next milestone in the development of the service occurs in 1969,??? the Crosfield Industrial Unit will move into a new, purpose-built factory, financed with the aid of a grant from the Department of Employment and Pro??? tivity. This factory will be a model of its kind. For the future there remains ??? setting up of a Home Workers scheme and the establishment of a new Adult Training Centre for the mentally handicapped. The three principal local authority units in the service are:â€” (i) the Crosfield Industrial Unit (the Sheltered Workshop); (ii) the Bensham Assessment and Rehabilitation Centre and (iii) the Waylands Craftwork, Training and Social Centre. 1. Crosfield Industrial Unit. This unit for severely disabled persons of all categories is a sheltered workshop, approved as such under Section 3 of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944. It is the headquarters and principal co-ordinating agency of the industrial therapy service. All but five of the severely disabled are full-time employees, appointed under special terms and conditions of service. A full 40-hour week is worked with the men earning Â£10. 16s. 8d. per week and the women Â£8. 0s. 10d. Responsibility allowances of up to Â£2 weekly may also be paid. Travelling expenses up to 2/- daily and free midday meals are provided. Two weeks paid holiday is given each year, and trade union membership is open to every employee. See Appendix page 123. 2. Bensham Assessment and Rehabilitation Centre This centre provides industrial work assessment for disabled persons who may eventually be capable of open employment. It was primarily established to provide a service for the mentally disordered, although some physically disabled persons can also be accommodated if alternative provision is not available. 39 It is run by the Council, with the active support and participation of the Department of Employment and Productivity. Persons admitted to the centre are allowed to attend for up to 12 months. By.the end of that time, and preferably sooner, they must move on - either to open employment, to sheltered work, or, in the event of failure, back to the centre or hospital which referred them. See Appendix page 124. CORPORATION DAY NURSERIES There are two day nurseries in the London Borough of Croydon, one at Whitehorse Road, Croydon and the other at Sanderstead Road, Sanderstead. They are available for children whose mothers are required to work because they are widows, unmarried, legally separated or divorced. By prior Committee permission, children from families with temporary difficulties - illness of the mother or father - may also be accepted. The minimum charge is 4/- per day It may be increased according to net income, on a scale approved by the Corporation. Subject to places being available, children may be accepted at the full rate of Â£1. 5s. Od. as from 1st December 1968. Whitehorse Hazleglen Road Sanderstead Road Details of attendances - Capacity 50 30 Number on books at the end of year 50 34 Attendances: Under 2 3,582 1,426 Over 2 5,947 4,416 Total 9,529 5,842 Number of days opened 256 256 Average daily attendance 37 23 DEAFNESS Schemes for testing all infants during the first year of life, whose names were included on the "At Risk" register, were continued. Furthermore this assessment of hearing ability was extended to all infants attending child health centres, and where staffing permitted, by home visits of health visitors. For detailed figures see Appendix page 107. 40 CHIROPODY The system of using the services of approved chiropodists working in their own surgeries was continued and attendances rose steadily. Satisfactory reports on the premises and mode of practice of all chiropodists in the scheme were received from the Corporation's visiting specialist. Domiciliary treatment was also included, but the fees came out of the financial allocation allowed to each practitioner. It was thus left to individual chiropodists to decide how they allocated services within their global budgets. The scheme covers elderly persons, expectant mothers and the permanently handicapped. It has proved a successful and popular service, and requests for increases were limited only by financial consideration. In one area, New Addington, the complete absence of any private chiropodist's surgery necessitated the provision of a Corporation clinic, and the engagement of a part-time chiropodist for 2 sessions a week. Similar facilities were provided at the "Waylands" Training Centre where up to 100 physically handicapped persons may attend each day and many need chiropody. On December 31st 1968, 24 chiropodists were operating this scheme. During the period January 1st to December 31st 1968, they gave 19,415 treatments at their surgeries and 4,369 by domiciliary visits. 443 treatments were given at Parkway Clinic, New Addington and 307 at "Waylands". CERVICAL CYTOLOGY This service remained limited by the facilities available at the special Regional Hospital Board laboratory but it was possible to deal with all the applications resulting from general publicity, with reasonable speed. In anticipation of the time when local campaigns will be necessary to obtain applicants, initial approaches were made to industrial and commercial firms offering them sessions in their own premises. In this way it is hoped that more women in groups with a greater incidence of cancer of the womb may accept the test. It is too early to judge the results of this method of approach. For detailed figures see Appendix page 120. REPORT OF THE CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR 43 WORK OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS W. Haworth, F.A.P.H.L Chief Public Health Inspector. I have the honour to submit a report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors for the year 1968. Work has been maintained at a fairly satisfactory level throughout the year having regard to the shortage of staff, and working conditions have improved beyond recognition as a result of our move to Taberner House. Housing in all its aspects is perhaps the most important and time consuming of the many duties undertaken by the Section. Although there are no longer in the Borough any large areas of unfit houses that merit Clearance Order procedure there is scope for further redevelopment in obsolescent areas. Action will also continue to be necessary as long as one can foresee, in respect of small pockets of property or individual houses and basements. During the year Demolition or Closing Orders were made in respect of 20 houses, and Closing Orders were made in respect of 18 basements or parts of houses. Houses in multiple occupation continue to provide a great deal of work and reasonable success can be claimed in obtaining compliance with notices served in respect of amenities and means of escape in case of fire. Similar comment can be made in respect of the repair provisions of the Housing Act, but the problem of "reasonable expense" in relation to cost of works and value of properties is becoming increasingly critical. The administration of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 has progressed and more detailed comment is made in the body of the report. The continued implementation of a smoke control policy in the Borough is a major cause for satisfaction. The long term effects of this environmental health measure will be demonstrated in terms of amenity and the public well being. Inspection of food and food premises is a most important duty and as far as possible increasing attention has been directed to this subject. Improved hygiene standards and remedial works are achieved in most cases by advice and educational work but in a number of cases it has been necessary to take more formal action as will be indicated in the list of prosecutions set out in this report. The recruitment of Public Health Inspectors remains an insoluble problem and it is only by training students that the Department can partly fill the vacancies caused by resignation and retirement. It is inevitable that more use will have to be made of Technical Assistants working under the supervision of qualified Public Health Inspectors and steps are being taken to this end. 44 In concluding this introduction to the report I should like to express my appreciation of the support and encouragement of the Chairman, ViceChairman and Members of the various Committees, the guidance and confidence of Dr. S.L. Wright, Medical Officer of Health and the very willing help and loyalty of the whole of my staff. 45 HOUSING The following is a summary of work carried out in respect of the sanitary condition of dwelling houses during the year:â€” 1.

Hot baths may be taken any time after 9 a.m. Clothes may be washed and dried in the wash-house provided. During the latter part of the year a policy of "run-down* in the number of occupants was introduced as it was anticipated that the Hostel would close in December, 1969 to make way for a Highway Improvement Scheme. There are no private common lodging houses. FACTORIES ACT, 1961 During the year the under-mentioned inspections have been made and defects were found as set out.

Premises are still being found-which are unregistered, and there still seems to be general ignorance on the part of both large and small firms of the requirement to register their premises if staff is employed. In accordance with normal practice and where appropriate, planning applications and plans have been referred to the department by the Borough Engineer for comment. The scrutiny of these plans followed by reports to architects, builders and agents with, in some cases, subsequent meetings, is time absorbing and inevitably affects the number of routine visits made to other premises. It is considered however that the long term gains made by this form of approach are well worthwhile. In all 850 plans have been scrutinised during the year under review. Shopfitters, in particular, seem loth to provide means of ventilation to shop front elevations on security grounds, but much good work has been done in this respect in the absence of other forms of ventilation such as air conditioning. A great deal of persuasion has to be used to convince occupiers of shops that entrance doors alone cannot be accepted as a means of ventilating a shop. In a piano shop dry rot found in the wood lined walls was so severe as to infect a piano to such an extent that it had to be destroyed. There was adequate provision for ventilating the shop but the windows had been sealed for a considerable time. Lack of handrails, particularly in staff quarters of large new shops, have been found to be a common fault and absence of steps, or unsuitable means of ascent from floor level to loading bay deck level have been found within months of completion of the premises. In one large store the metal staircase balusters were so weak at the change of direction on each floor of a six floored building as to fail to withstand reasonable pressure of goods carried by hand and replacement by strong metal mesh was found necessary. Staircases designed as an architectural feature with rounded treads and risers at the bottom of the flight and with handrails not extending to the full length of the staircase provide accident risk to staff and customers alike. Eleven complaints were received during the year respecting overcrowding, heating and ventilation of shops and offices. 50 No doubt as a result of high overheads in new office blocks, there is a tendency on the part of some occupiers to overcrowd their premises. Recognition of overcrowding and maintenance of effective ventilation, particularly where there is partitioning of offices, requires careful inspection and survey, In my report for the year 1967 I recorded that a Certificate of Exemption was granted for a period of six months in respect of a large office, which was overcrowded. The Certificate of Exemption expired on the 6th June, 1968, and, in the meantime the Company had taken over occupancy of adjoining offices in addition to their existing accommodation on the same floor, thus abating the overcrowding. The Certificate of Exemption was therefore withdrawn. A type of electric water heater is on the market which consists of a container filled manually by connecting a rubber tube to the water supply tap. When the container becomes empty, the manual operation in filling has to be repeated. Reinspections have revealed neglect in refilling, extending in some cases, it is thought, over a number of days. Occupiers have been warned, when served with a notice to provide running hot or warm water, that this type of heater is deprecated, and, if found empty on reinspections, will be considered as a contravention of the Act. Water closet compartments are still found which are cluttered up with tools or commodities, and obstructed passages are still frequently encountered for the same reason. Problems arising from insufficient sanitary accommodation shared by the sexes where more than five persons are employed have been investiaged and resolved. Lack of running hot water in laundry receiving offices seems to be a speciality of the trade. It is extremely rare on primary inspection to find a supply of hot water in such premises, and notices have been served in plenty, often with a threat of proceedings in default. As the employees have to handle soiled and dirty clothing, one would regard the provision of hot water almost as essential as that required for food handlers, and that this would have long been the concern of the trade in question. Petrol service stations have been found without running hot water for hand washing. Complaints have been received that employees dislike eating their food on the premises with hands from which petrol odour has not been fully removed by cold water washing. It is the policy of the department to investigate all accidents. Such investigations are worthless unless painstaking investigation is carried out. Frequently the stated cause of the accident reported has been found to be quite incorrect, and failure to interview the injured person would have resulted in faulty administrative action. Reports of accidents are often given by managers of premises who have not witnessed the accident and have to report from hearsay. When interviewing an injured person, one is able to assess the personal characteristics of the individual concerned, 51 his physical ability, ascertain the type of footwear used and whether or not spectacles are worn etc. Close questioning sometimes brings out other factors closely related to the incident. The number of accidents reported in 1968 was 150, compared with 118 in 1967. The number of notifications has therefore increased, but as a large number of the accidents reported are from multiple firms in the Borough it is thought that a number of notifiable accidents must still continue to be unreported, in view of the number of premises registered. Occupiers are advised, when general inspections are made, of their responsibility to notify accidents as defined in the Act. Haste and endeavour to "save time" continue to contribute to a large number of accidents. Persons running to closing lift doors and falling in the attempt, hurrying downstairs, "speeding up" conveyor belts and taking "short cuts" all contribute to the increasing number of accidents reported. A number of firms employ "week-end students" for short periods. The risk in such employment lies in the fact that such employees do not always receive adequate training in handling machines or are unaware of the particular hazards of the occupation and several accidents have occurred for these reasons. An accident was caused in a builder's yard due to the contents of a paint kettle, containing caustic solution, being splashed into the eyes of a yardman. The man was employed in clearing up the yard and the paint kettle, together with other open cans had been in the yard for some time and had been filled with rainwater. The contents of the various containers were therefore unknown and when the paint kettle was picked up suddenly, the accident occurred. Fortunately access to a nearby standpipe tap supplying fresh water reduced the injury to the skin of the face particularly around the eyes. Hospital treatment followed and the injured person recovered from his facial injuries. The provision of an eye bath in the First Aid Box would have been of considerable assistance in this case. Such an eye bath is not required under the Regulations and the appropriate officer of the Ministry appointed under the Act has been informed of this shortcoming. A boiler fitter suffered burns due to the blowback of an oil fired burner which he was testing following breakdown. Consideration for the welfare of warehousemen, boiler attendants, lift mechanics and maintenance engineers leaves much to be desired in the preparation of plans of many new buildings. Boiler houses have been found to be constructed with extremely cramped conditions for the workers and a number of these rooms lack secondary means of exit in case of fire. Very often no provision is made for a bench where a mechanic may deposit detached parts, lighting points are not always correctly placed and it is found difficult to attach long lead cables to inspect remote parts of the boiler. 52 One fatality occurred to a woman employee who fell on a short flight of stairs and struck her head against a wall at the foot of the stairs. Another accident occurred on concrete stairs of quite recent construction in a large office where, not only was there found to be difference in the height of the risers of the stairs in the same flight, but there was a difference in several treads to the extent of Â¾ of an inch in the height between each side, of the same riser. Although no regulations exist, as yet, for portable steps and ladders, particular attention is paid to these items of equipment when inspecting premises. Boxes of varying sizes and tea chests have been used as a substitute and have collapsed in the process. Accidents arising from improper or defective steps can have serious effects. One such accident occurred with serious consequences in the office of a well known Company. One step of a short step ladder completely collapsed when stood upon causing the employee to fall to the ground. The Company was instructed to carry out a thorough inspection of all steps and ladders in their premises and to repair or destroy any such equipment found defective. Accidents due to "horseplay", thoughtlessness, ignoring warning notices, and improper use of implements continue. An employee received a cut thumb when using a gravity feed food slicing machine for slicing cucumbers for sandwiches. Whilst the machine was adequately equipped for the purpose for which it was made, its use for slicing cucumbers was highly improper. The firm provided a hand slicer as a result of the accident. An employee was injured in the print room of a large firm due to an explosion of ether caused by another employee smoking a cigarette in close proximity and despite a "No Smoking" notice being exhibited. The management have issued a warning notice that summary dismissal will result in future in the event of an employee offending against the "No Smoking" rule. An employee badly cut his hand by endeavouring to remove the screw cap of a mineral water bottle by jamming it between rails of a window sash. The bottle broke at the neck causing laceration of the tendons of his hand. During the year five cases were reported to the Town Clerk with a view to legal action being taken. (1) A firm of solicitors employed one assistant in a room with insufficient airspace, contrary to Section 5(2). As a result of a letter from the Town Clerk, the adjoining office was integrated with the smaller office occupied by the assistant, and the overcrowding was thus abated, 53 (2) A laundry receiving office was not maintaining a floor covering, contrary to Section 16(1), and protruding metal nosings to stairtreads were not being maintained in a safe condition contrary to the same section. As a result of a letter from the Town Clerk, the work required to make safe the flooring and stairs was carried out. (3) A multiple firm of radio and television dealers was not providing means for drying outdoor clothing contr ary to Section 12(1) (b). A letter was sent to the Company by the Town Clerk. When the Inspector revisited the premises he was shown an electric bar heater fitted tothe wall, but not capable of being connected to a power point. The Inspector revisited a few days later when the bar was found connected with the power point but still ineffective when the switch was turned on. The manager stated that the heater "took a long time to warm up". The Inspector visited some two hours later and found the heater still not operating and the manager then admitted that the heater bar was defective. As a result of the Inspector's repeated visits and persistence a new heating bar was fitted. (4) A ladies outfitters was reported for failure to provided suitable and efficient ventilation of the shop contrary to Section 7, and to the water closet compartment, contrary to Section 9. These matters were, however, remedied before the Town Clerk commenced the institution of proceedings. (5) The occupiers of a sugar confectionery shop were reported for failure:â€” (a) to maintain the walls and ceiling of the shop in a clean condition contrary to Section 4(1), (b) to repair or renew the defective flooring in the shop behind the counter and in the shop doorway contrary to Section 16(1), (c) to maintain walls, ceiling, windows and woodwork of the storeroom in a clean condition contrary to Section 4(1), (d) to provide a supply of clean, running hot and cold or warm water for ablution purposes contrary to Section 10(1). A letter was sent to the Company by the Town Clerk, and, at the date of this report, certain matters were in process of being complied. 54 TABLE A - Registrations and General Inspections Class of Premises Number of Premises Registered during the year Total Number of Registered Premises at end of year Number of Registered Premises receiving a general inspection during the year (1) (2) (3) (4) Offices 106 1,188 121 Retail Shops 174 1,911 515 Wholesale Shops, Warehouses 9 110 26 Catering Establishments open to the public, Canteens 43 203 56 Fuel Storage Depot - 2 - TOTALS 332 3,414 718 TABLE B - Number of Visits of all kinds by Inspectors to Registered Premises 3,750 TABLE C - Analysis of Persons Employed in Registered Premises by Workplace Class of Workplace Number of Persons Employed (1) (2) Offices 28,734 Retail Shops 12,238 Wholesale Departments, Warehouses 2,154 Catering Establishments open to the public 2,662 Canteens 511 Fuel storage depots 22 TOTAL 46,321 Total Males 22,151 Total Females 24,170 TABLE D - Exemptions No exemptions were granted under the Act during 1968. TABLE E - Prosecutions There were no prosecutions under the Act during the year. The majority of inspections carried out under the Act are undertaken by a Specialist Public Health Inspector assisted by three Technical Assistants. In addition, the public health inspectorate (establishment - 20) carry out inspections at food premises to avoid duplication of visits. Three members of the clerical staff are employed full time on work in connection with the Act. 55 REMEDIAL WORKS ETC.

Such Agencies, which include "au-pair" agencies are licenced annually and inspection of the records kept by these firms are carried out to ensure that the provisions of the Act are complied. In most cases the premises concerned are also subject to the provisions of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963. SHOPS ACTS The Shops Acts regulate the closing hours of shops and the working hours of shop assistants. Failure to observe "closing hours" has given little cause for complaint during the year. 790 inspections were made under the Shops Acts; infringements found were as follows:â€” Hours of Closing - Notices to be exhibited or amended 301 Meal Intervals not granted to Staff - Opening Hours of Launderettes 2 PROSECUTIONS UNDER SHOPS ACT, 1950 There were no prosecutions under the Act during the year. Inspection of Schools The kitchens and serveries, washing facilities and sanitary accommodation are inspected and any defects or amendments requiring attention are referred to the Chief Education Officer. During the year 78 such inspections were made. HAIRDRESSING ESTABLISHMENTS Legislation calls for the registration of hairdressers' and barbers' premises. During the year 208 inspections were made of registered premises to check that the Byelaws in force were being observed. Generally little cause for complaint was found. 38 new Registration Certificates were issued. DRAINAGE 2,532 visits of inspection were made to underground drains in course of repair. Of 456 Statutory Orders served, in 98 cases work was carried out in default of the owners. 57 At the end of the year there were 60 cesspools in the Borough serving premises without main drainage. POLLUTION OF RIVERS AND STREAMS During the year 6 inspections were made to ascertain if any evidence of pollution or obstruction was apparent in the water courses within the Borough and in addition samples of the waters were taken for analysis. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 1961 The provisions of the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 and Regulations made thereunder have now been incorporated in the Consumer Protection Act, 1961 which empowers the Secretary of State to make Regulations in respect of any goods which he may prescribe, imposing such requirements as he may think expedient, to prevent or reduce risk of death or personal injury. The Oil Heaters Regulations, 1966, came into force on 1st June, 1966 to amend and extend the 1962 Regulations, which imposed requirements as to construction, design and performance of domestic space heaters. In October 1964, the Children's Nightdresses Regulations 1964 came into operation. These Regulations require all nightdresses coming within the scope of the Regulations to be made of a fabric which conforms to the low flammability requirements of a British Standard. Regulations have been introduced governing the safety of stands for carrycots, and the labelling of nightdresses to indicate the flammability of the material used. Regulations also govern the use of certain materials in the manufacture of toys and, during the year, seven toys were submitted for chemical examination. Four of these articles were unsatisfactory and the retailer concerned immediately withdrew the remaining stock from sale. Visits are made to shops trading in these articles to ensure that the requirements of the Regulations are complied with. THE FABRICS (MISDESCRIPTION) ACT, 1913 THE FABRICS (MISDESCRIPTION) REGULATIONS 1959 The above mentioned Regulations prescribe standards of non-flammability for textile fabrics which claim to be non-flammable. 58 ANIMAL BOARDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1963 The above Act, prohibits the keeping of a boarding establishment for animals (defined by the Act as cats and dogs) except under licence granted by the local authority. Licences are granted subject to conditions attached thereto. During the year seven such licences were issued. MINES AND QUARRIES ACT, 1954 This Act requires compliance with provisions designed to prevent accidents arising through lack of proper fencing or too easy access. Routine visits are made to quarries in the district as necessary, THE SCRAP METAL DEALERS ACT, 1964 This Act requires dealers in scrap metal to be licenced by the local authority. Dealers are required to maintain, in a prescribed manner, records of their business transactions. Special provision is made for "itinerant" dealers who may be exempted from the keeping of full records of their transactions and this and other provisions of the Act are administered in co-operation with the local police. During the year 4 new licences were issued to local dealers. THE RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1964 This Act provides for the licencing and inspection of riding establishments by the local authority. Licences are granted subject to conditions attached thereto and inspections are carried out at six-monthly intervals by authorised veterinary surgeons. Two licences have been granted to local establishments. C AMPING SITES The Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, confers on Local Authorities powers for the control of caravan sites and apart from improved planning powers it provides for a system of site licencing to be administered by District Councils. Site licences in force during the year were as follows:â€” 59 Address No. of Caravans Period of Licence Hall & Co. Depot, Marlpit Lane, Coulsdon. 1 1 year from 10.12.67 Dennards Yard, Magdala Road, Croydon. 1 Indefinite period. Site licence conditions require a water carriage system of drainage, main water supply and fire precautions. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 The Council has implemented the relevant provisions of this Act in making Smoke Control Orders covering the South, West and Northern areas of the Borough and it is the intention that one Smoke Control Order shall be made each year. The progress of these Orders is shown below:â€” Smoke Control Order No. of premises (incl. Factories and Commercial) No. of duellings Acreage Date of Order Date of Operation No. 1 2,076 1,916 620 22.12.58 1. 4.61 No. 2 3,042 2,686 265 26. 2.60 1.10.61 No. 3 4,501 3,915 332 22.11.60 1.10.62 No. 4 5,547 4,112 710 24.11.61 1. 7.63 No. 5 7,042 6,651 570 17.12.62 1. 7.64 No. 6 6,220 5,885 470 18.11.63 1. 7.65 No. 7 8,198 7,788 1,060 21.12.64 1. 7.66 No. 8 7,198 6,777 460 20.12.65 1. 7.67 No. 9 6,158 5,605 554 19.12.66 1. 7.68 No. 10 6,670 6,351 596 18.12.67 1. 7.69 No. 11 7,099 6,573 588 27. 1.69 1. 7.70 The District Inspectors keep observation on the various factory chimneys within their districts with a view to observing any contravention of the Clean Air Act in respect of smoke and grit emissions. During the year 32 plans showing the construction and heights of new chimneys were examined and in 20 cases additional height was requested and agreed. 42 notices of ihe installation of new furnaces were received, 29 of these being oil fired plants. DISINFECTION The Borough Disinfecting Station is situated at Factory Lane. Two steam disinfectors are in use supplied with steam from a gas fired boiler within the Station. 60 The following articles were disinfected during the year:â€” By Steam 7,217 articles By Formalin Gas 294 articles Total 7,511 articles Disinfection of bedding and upholstered articles is carried out for traders, who deliver them to, and collect them from, the station. For this service a charge is made. Disinfection was carried out after infectious or contagious diseases as follows:â€” 28 rooms, hospital wards, clinics etc. 19 library and other books. On request disinfection was also carried out for conditions other than notifiable infectious diseases and for which a charge is made. During the year Â£51.183.6d. was paid for such services. 1,165 items of home nursing equipment were disinfected. CLEANSING OF VERMINOUS, ETC., PERSONS A cleansing station consisting of a reception room, three bathrooms and a discharge room is attached to the Disinfecting Station and is used for dealing with verminous, etc. conditions in adults and children. A woman attendant deals with children and women. During the year 6 adults and 20 children were cleansed of verminous conditions and 26 adults and 28 children were treated for scabies. DISINFESTATION OF PREMISES Modern insecticides provide a ready and easily applied remedy for vermin and pest infestation of premises, etc. and occupiers are advised and instructed in their use by the Inspectors. The department assisted in the more difficult cases numbering 138, either by spraying or fumigation, NOISE ABATEMENT During the year 93 complaints were made regarding noise alleged to be a nuisance. Id. 15 cases no action was warranted. In 61 instances the noise complained of was abated, or reduced so as not to be a nuisance and 17 cases are still under investigation. 61 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 The object is to regulate the sale of certain poisonous substances. During the year the number of applications granted for entry of names on the list of persons entitled to sell poisons under Part 2 of the Act was 23. In addition, 200 applications were made for the retention of names on the list for a further 12 months. No infringement of the Act was found. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 The Act regulates the manufacture and sale of materials used as fillings for upholstery, bedding, toys, etc., with the object of compelling the use of clean fillings. Only one firm is now engaged in this type of business within the Borough. Four samples of cotton felt were taken. All of these samples conformed with the requirements of the Regulations made under the Act. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act governs the sale of pet animals and, during the year, 18 licences were renewed and six new licences granted. The proprietor of a licenced pet shop was prosecuted following his failure, on three occasions, to isolate sick animals and for obstructing an Inspector during his inspection of the premises. The Court imposed fines totalling Â£40. The application for the renewal of this particular licence, for 1969, was subsequently refused by the appropriate Committee and the shop has now been closed. During the year 53 inspections of licensed pet shops were carried out and, apart from the above case, no infringements of the Act were found. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACT No case of contagious animal disease was reported within the Borough during the year. In such cases action is taken in conjunction with officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to provide against the spread of the disease. Regular visits are made by district inspectors to premises where animals are kept to ensure that precautionary measures and a high standard of cleanliness are maintained. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 This Act is mainly concerned with the destruction of rats and mice and places a duty upon the occupier of any premises to report to the Local Authority any infestation by such rodents. Three rodent operatives are emPloyed full time to deal with complaints. 62 During the year 3,475 premises were inspected following complaint and in 3,227 instances infestation was confirmed and dealt with by the rodent operatives. In addition, 72 premises were inspected for reasons other than complaint. Regular inspections are made of premises where food is prepared or sold and particular attention is given to methods of prevention of rodent infestation. Corporation owned premises, including sewage works, depots, school kitchens and serveries etc. are periodically inspected for the presence of rodents and appropriate action taken if the premises are infested. Recent evidence indicates that there is no heavy rat infestation of the Corporation's foul water sewers and, during the year, 592 manholes were test baited. Further treatments are planned to cover the whole Borough and treatment has also been carried out in two areas where sewer infestations were suspected. FOOD SUPPLY The supervision and inspection of food supplies is carried out by the Public Health Inspectors who are all qualified in food inspection. Of the premises in the Borough where food is stored, manufactured or sold, 1,297 are registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, as follows:â€” Retail sale of ice-cream 1,019 Manufacturers of ice-cream Nil Preparation or manufacture for sale of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food 278 During the year 5,467 inspections and re-inspections were made of food businesses (for details see Page FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 The following table shows the premises in the Borough at which food is sold, manufactured or stored. These premises are subject to the above Regulations and special reference is made to the provision of wash hand basins (Section 16) and sinks (Section 19) at premises where unwrapped food is handled. 63 Description No. of premises Wash hand basins provided during 1968 No. to which Sec. 19 applies No. of sinks fitted to comply with Sec. 19 during 1968 Bakehouses and Bakers Shops 118 3 118 3 Sugar Confectioners 412 7 370 5 Cafes, Restaurants, Snack Bars, etc. 256 13 256 16 Works & Club Canteens 391 10 391 9 Licensed Premises 141 9 141 7 Off Licences 111 - 20 - Grocers 307 5 270 4 Butchers 155 2 155 2 Wholesale Meat Markets 8 - - - Chemists 86 - 86 - Greengrocers 214 2 214 2 Fishmongers 41 1 47 1 Fried Fish Shops 38 2 38 2 Milk Distributors and Dairies 298 2 267 2 Premises from which Roundsmen & Mobile Shops operate 92 - 91 - Food Manufacturers 18 - 18 - Supermarkets and General Shops 163 5 81 6 FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955, FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960, AS AMENDED AND FOOD HYGIENE (MARKETS, STALLS AND DELIVERY VEHICLES) REGULATIONS, 1966, AS AMENDED Food Premises Structural defects in shops and stores remedied 1 Defective condition of walls, ceilings, doors and window glazing 288 Defective condition of floors, utensils, fixtures, etc. remedied 142 Defective or insufficient drainage repaired 6 Lighting, heating cr ventilation provided 48 W.C. accommodation - repair or cleansing 48 â€ž â€ž - artificial lighting provided 1 â€ž â€ž - intervening ventilated space provided 3 Food - now stored 18 ins. off floor 15 â€ž - means to prevent risk of contamination provided 73 â€ž - store provided or repaired 4 Accumulations in yard or stores removed 45 Offal and refuse bins provided 45 Yard paving repaired 5 Hand washing notices exhibited 53 Ablutions - Wash basins provided 61 â€ž - Hot water supplies provided 97 â€ž - Nail brushes, soap and towels provided 91 Clothing accommodation provided 25 Sinks installed 59 Smoking offences abated 14 Defective or unsuitable table tops replaced 86 First Aid kits provided 43 Cleanliness - advice given 21 Rats/Mice Infestation abated 17 Repair /Cleansing of Machinery/Refrigerators 69 Leaflets on Food Hygiene supplied 20 64 Stalls and Delivery Vehicles Wash hand basins/Sinks with hot water provided 32 Nail brushes, -soap, towels provided 9 First Aid kits provided 15 Washable overclothing provided 31 Name and address boards supplied 48 Food now stored 18 ins. off floor 25 Accumulation of refuse etc. 21 Receptacles for waste food provided 24 Screening for stalls provided 22 Smoking offences abated 3 Cleanliness od Stalls and Vehicles remedied 43 Advice given on Storage of Stalls 3 Lighting of Stalls/Vans improved 2 Condemned Foodstuffs Summary of meat and other articles of food found to be unfit and condemned by Inspectors during 1968:â€” Article Weight in lbs.

Disposal of Condemned Foodstuffs Meat condemned at wholesale meat markets or at shops, and other condemned foodstuffs, are destroyed by incineration. MEAT INSPECTION District inspectors examine home killed and imported carcase meat and offal at the 8 wholesale meat depots in the Borough. Meat exposed for sale is inspected in butchers' shops. The Diseases of Animals (Waste Foods) Order, 1957 The Order provides that, in general, all waste foods must be boiled before feeding to animals to minimise the spread of animal diseases, Licences to operate boiling plants and equipment are issued after inspection of the premises and plants. MILK SUPPLY During the year 94 inspections were made of dairies and premises from which milk is sold. 65 The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1963 The following licences have been granted during the year to dealers distributing milk from premises in Croydon. Licences to use the designation "Pasteurised" - (a) Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licences 23 Licences to use the designation "Sterilised" - (a) Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licences 7 Licences to use the designation "Untreated* - (a) Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licences Licences to use the Designation "Ultra Heat Treated" - (a) Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licences 13 Frequent inspections of these licenced premises are carried out during the year to see that the conditions of the licences are observed. The Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 One applicant has been registered as a distributor of cream. Bacteriological Examinations of Milk During the year the following samples of milk were examined:â€” Pasteurised Milk 68 Sterilised Milk 46 Untreated Milk 14 Ultra Heat Treated 6 The following tables summarise the results of bacteriological examinations of pasteurised, sterilised and untreated milk samples during the year:â€” Untreated Milk Methylene Blue Test No. Samples Taken Not Satisfied Satisfied 14 2 12 The above samples of raw milk were also examined for the presence of brucella abortus and antibiotics. In all cases the results of the tests were negative. Pasteurised Milk Methylene Blue Test No. Samples Taken Not Satisfied Satisfied 68 1 67 66 Sterilised Milk Turbidity Test No. Samples Taken Not Satisfied Satisfied 46 1 45 Ultra Heat Treated Milk Colony Count No. Samples Taken Not Satisfied Satisfied 6 - 6 Bacteriological Examination of Milk Bottle Rinses Bottle Rinse Samples - 25 Satisfactory - 22 Unsatisfactory - 3 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF CREAM One sample of fresh cream was examined and gave a satisfactory result. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF ICE CREAM 92 samples were taken, the results being:â€” Grade No. of Samples 1 86 2 2 3 1 4 3 In all cases after the results of sampling are known, the vendors and/ or manufacturers are made aware of the reports, and where the gradings are 3 or 4, a visit is made, methods of service or manufacture are investigated, faults rectified and further samples taken. CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF ICE CREAM One sample was taken from a local shop and was found to comply with the standard. 67 THE LIQUID EGG (PASTEURISATION) REGULATIONS, 1963 These Regulations provide that liquid egg shall be pasteurised before use in food intended for human consumption. There is no egg pasteurisation plant in Croydon. 12 samples of liquid egg obtained from local bakeries and submitted to the prescribed alpha-amylese test proved satisfactory. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 During the year, 151 samples of milk and cream, and 274 other samples were taken, of which number, 27 were found to be "Not Genuine".

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, In presenting this fourth Annual Report of the work of the School Health Service for the London Borough of Croydon, I would mention certain items. Routine School Medical Inspections These increased in number to cope with a larger school population. The percentage of children found with defects requiring attention was lower than in 1967. It is satisfactory to know that the health of children is improving, but the diminished positive findings emphasized the need to reconsider any equally effective alternative procedure less costly in medical time. Unfortunately none has so far been described which seems to make a major change unquestionably worthwhile. Cleanliness and Skin Defects Last year I commented on the reappearance of scabies and ringworm of the scalp. Fewer cases were found in 1968 than in the previous year. Details are given of a commencing enquiry into the prevalence, cause and treatment of Athlete's Foot, begun with the help of the bacteriology department of a 2 skin diseases hospital. Plantar warts continued to be a great nuisance to many children. Advantages of bare feet activities were again questioned. However if barred for drill and games, the problem of swimming would remain, for which no disinfection techniques give certain protection. Defects of Vision Comments are made about a survey of 13 year old children, for whom glasses had been prescribed. Nearly one quarter were not wearing their spectacles for a variety of somewhat doubtful reasons. Mental Health In-service group discussion sessions for school medical officers, with the Psychiatrist from the Child Guidance Clinic continued. Fewer children were referred to the Clinic, and more were undoubtedly helped directly by the school doctors, as a result of the knowledge and support gained through these discussion sessions. Nutrition Despite evidence of children being sent to school without breakfast, obesity was still the greater danger to future health and longevity. As explained it indicates not merely an excessive food intake, but also a faulty dietary. Remedial efforts were continued. Dental Services Mr. W.G. Everett, the Chief Dental Officer, left to join the Department of Education and Science. He had a particular interest in preventive dentistry, an aspect also deemed of great importance by his successor, Mr. J.D. Palmer. Deafness The report on services to meet this defect notes the addition of a fourth unit at Riddlesdown School. The Committee's comprehensive scheme covering all day facilities has been built up, despite great staffing shortages, over the last five years. The outbreak of rubella in 1962 resulted, despite efforts by obstetricians, in a sudden increase of children with congenital hearing defects. They are now assured of an adequate remedial service. Building Programme Work began on the second school for E.S.N. children and plans were prepared for the new school for maladjusted pupils. The nursery unit at St. Giles School for the Physically Handicapped was deferred by the Department of Education and Science. The survival, through surgery of the newly born, of gravely handicapped children makes this a growing need. It was contained by placing such children in Corporation day nurseries, or reimbursing charges to private nursery groups. The latter cannot accept the most serious cases, and there are long waiting lists of priority group mothers for day nursery vacancies 3 Health Education Efforts continued to include this subject as part of general education as outlined by â€œHealth Education - Patterns for Teaching" (Elliott & May) of which copies were distributed to all Croydon schools in 1967. That such knowledge should be made available is clearly even more essential in the current permissive society than at any previous time. Children should at least know the alternatives and the risks, and the response of the majority is encouraging. It is not easy to balance the youthful urge to test old ideas and try new ways, with safeguards for health, and a long and perhaps unexciting life. The pattern suggested does achieve this approach, and was thus commended. Co-operation with other health services. There have been established in Croydon, as in many comparable areas, close links with the hospital and general practitioner services. This policy of working within the ambit of local hospital schemes, thus avoiding unnecessary duplication and perhaps conflicting advice to parents, has always been supported by the Committee. One would hope that these and other advantages gained by leaving personal services to local control would not be lost in any new administrative structure. The original proposals in the 1968 "Green Paper" were therefore viewed with some concern. Infectious Diseases The two yearly cycles of measles outbreaks have for many years proved a great nuisance in primary schools. The issue of an effective vaccine resulted first in an approach to Head Teachers for assistance in offering this protection, and I regretted asking for another interruption of school routines. However, as usual help was readily forthcoming, many thousands of children were given the vaccine, and the anticipated outbreak at the end of 1968 began with about one-sixth of the number of cases usually notified. There seemed good hopes that a method of preventing measles had been found. Children taken ill at School This problem has apparently grown in recent years, perhaps connected with, and certainly aggravated by the increasing number of households having no one available to receive a sick child during school hours. It seems to be reaching a stage when support may be needed from the School Health Service. As always I must thank members of the Education Department and Head Teachers and school staff for unfailing cordial co-operation. The problems of the Committee in meeting ever mounting demands are understood, and their support in the maintenance and prudent development of essential services are fully appreciated. 4 Finally, on Dr. Horner, responsible for day to day administration and the compiling of this report, and on all members of the department coping with routine duties, rests the real success of our efforts. Yours faithfully, S.L. WRIGHT, Principal School Medical Officer. 5 PARTICULARS OF SCHOOL CLINICS as at 31.12.1968 The following Clinics are provided by the Education Committee; attendance, with the exception of the Minor Ailments Clinics, is by appointment arranged by the Principal School Medical Officer:- Clinic Address Minor Ailments Lodge Road, Broad Green, Croydon.

MEDICAL INSPECTION IN SCHOOLS The Medical inspection of school children at fixed intervals during their school lives has been an integral part of the development of the School Health Service, and the following system of routine medical inspection has been adopted in all maintained schools within the Borough and in other schools which have requested it. (i) Entrants Children admitted for the first time to school and not already examined as Entrants, i.e. normally between 5 years and 6 years. (ii) 8 Year Old Group Children in their second year in a Junior School, unless previously examined in the Junior School. (iii) Entrants to Secondary School Children in their first year in a Secondary School. (iv) Final Leavers Children in their last year of attendance at school who have not been medically examined in that year. (v) Special Cases Children of any age whom the Head Teacher and parents wish the Medical Officer to see at his next visit. No change in the existing programme of routine medical inspection was considered during the year in view of the findings of research projects described in earlier reports. Nevertheless, the whole subject was again critically reviewed in the light of current financial difficulties and the need for economy. During the last three years there has been a small but significant decline in the number of defects found in proportion to the number of medical inspections. This is welcome evidence that the health of Croydon school children is improving but, as fewer children with defects are found, so the assertion that every child should have a comprehensive medical examination becomes more difficult to justify. The examination of large numbers of defect free children raises problems for staff since, paradoxically, it increases the risk that when a defect is present, it will be overlooked. Experiments elsewhere with selective medical examinations, have concentrated upon selecting particular children for inspection to the exclusion of others. Significant objections to such schemes have emerged, but a more selective examination based on the individual needs of every child seems more likely to concentrate effort where it is most needed without denying to large numbers of children the undoubted advantages of a routine medical inspection. 8 Table I. Numbers seen at Medical Inspections 1968 Routine Inspections â€” 17,798 Special Inspections â€” at school medical sessions 698 at inspection clinics 62 760 Reinspections â€” at school medical sessions 2,975 at inspection clinics 382 3,357 The number of children who were medically examined in 1968 shows a significant increase compared with the previous year, but the figures should be interpreted cautiously and in conjunction with those in Appendix C, page S3. A change in the status of one school has resulted in an apparent reduction in the number of inspections in non-maintained schools, with a corresponding increase in the number for maintained schools. In addition, however, there has still been an increase in the absolute number of medical examinations probably due to similar increases in the total school population (page 54 ). The number of special inspections also shows an increase mainly in those undertaken at schools, suggesting that teachers are finding it increasingly helpful to present children for a medical opinion at times when a routine examination is not yet due. The fact that school medical officers now visit infant departments at least once every term enables the teacher to obtain medical advice about a particular child very easily. The number of reinspections, however, suggests a significant reduction especially in those conducted at inspection clinics as the trend towards follow-up in school noted in last year's report (page 7) continues. During the last three years the proportion of parents who attended the inspections has shown minor fluctuations around a stationary level of 53%. The high proportion of parents who attend the first medical inspection continues to be most welcome. Table 2.

The decline compared with the previous year is mainly due to reductions in the number of dental and orthopaedic defects which were recorded. A further 5,985 defects were referred for observation by the school medical officers. A summary of the defects which were found has been recorded in Table 3. The proportion of defects which were discovered in every hundred children examined has been recorded in Table 4. Personal Hygiene A general improvement in this small but persistent problem was noted during the year. The number of children who were found unclean for the first time showed a reduction of 22%. and the number of cases of uncleanliness at follow up visits declined by 86 (Table 5). Once again it is pleasing to place on record the continued vigilance of the school nurses in their attempts to eradicate this problem. A cleansing station is provided for the treatment of scabies and persistent verminous conditions. Twenty-one school children attended the cleansing station for treatment of scabies, and fifteen school children were treated for head vermin. Both of these figures are smaller than those in 1967. TABLE 5. CLEANLINESS INSPECTIONS Number of children inspected for cleanliness 48,712 Number of children inspected at follow-up visits 1,258 Number found unclean for the first time in 1968 277 Number of occasions in which children were found unclean at follow-up visits 55 12 Skin Defects The number of skin defects reported at medical inspections showed a slight reduction during the year. The proportion of skin defects in boys and girls shows an interesting variation with age. In the primary schools the experience of the two groups is similar with a slight increase in incidence with age. In secondary schools the girls continue this trend whereas the boys show a sudden and dramatic increase in incidence (Table 4). An important factor in this pattern is the condition known as Athlete's Foot. This condition is accompanied by scaling of the skin and maceration between the toes. In most cases it results from infection by a fungus (tinea pedis) and several surveys have demonstrated its spread through communal showering facilities. In other cases the symptoms are precipitated by excessive sweating and poor foot hygiene without any specific infective organism. It is not usually a serious condition but it does cause discomfort and the risk of secondary infection. Hitherto the service has provided advice on good foot hygiene especially the need to wash the feet regularly even after a visit to the swimming baths, and to dry the skin carefully between the toes without vigorous rubbing. Such actions certainly help to prevent the condition but there has been increasing pressure upon the Service to provide treatment facilities. After discussion with the British Medical Association, it has been agreed that the Service should identify and diagnose those cases which are due to a fungal infection. This will necessitate a minor laboratory investigation. Thereafter the Service will ask the family doctor whether he wishes to to provide appropriate treatment. Sometimes cases cannot easily be supervised in a busy surgery and the School Health Service will then provide medicaments and a regular review through the existing school clinics which already provide treatment for many skin conditions. The incidence of plantar warts (verrucae) was again troublesome. The discomfort and long period of exclusion from sporting activities which are associated with the condition naturally prompts parents to consider possible preventive measures. The Service regularly receives letters of complaint asking that barefoot activity in school should be prohibited on medical grounds. It is indeed unfortunate that barefoot physical education is so actively encouraged by those who advise on educational matters since, as Dr. Thelma Wield points out, "it seems that the risk of infection from this 13 practice outweighs any advantages it may have." The Service can only repeat the advice which it has frequently given, and which is mentioned on pages 12 and 13 of the 1965 Report, and page 11 of the 1966 Report, that the prohibition of barefoot physical education is desirable at all times and essential when cases are occurring in the school. Sporadic cases of ringworm continued to occur during the year, but prompt treatment ensured that no spread occurred amongst school contacts. The 1966 Report (page 11) and the 1967 Report (page 11) have also made reference to the reappearance of this troublesome condition which was thought to have been eradicated. Vision Defects Defects of vision constitute the largest single group of abnormalities discovered by the School Health Service (Table 3). The incidence of vision defects in Croydon exceeds the average incidence both in London as a whole and in England and Wales. Nevertheless, it is by no means the highest figure and the very diversity of authorities showing rates sometimes twice that in Croydon quickly eliminates any aetiological theories. It is interesting to note that the incidence of such defects in Croydon is greater amongst girls than boys. This difference between the sexes has been present in each of the four Reports presented by the London Borough of Croydon but, again, the temptation to speculate concerning its origin must be resisted. The observation does, however, highlight the problems faced by the Service in ensuring that the educational impact of vision defects is minimal. Some children are unwilling to wear their glasses even for school work and in girls at least, appearance is a reason often put forward. It is remarkable how frequently spectacles seem to be mislaid or broken when a routine vision test in school is due. Even more surprising is the number of children who insist that they have been advised that spectacles are only necessary "for watching television". If a child requires glasses for this purpose is it unreasonable to assume that he might also require them for the close work required at school?. Moreover, is society really providing spectacles free of charge or at reduced cost solely for the purpose of improved television viewing? During 1968, 23.3% of school children aged 13 years in Croydon were not wearing the glasses which had been prescribed for them. It is pleasing to report that the facilities for diagnosis and correction of vision defects have been much improved by the Committee's decision to open a third school eye clinic in 1967 at New Addington. All three clinics are being fully utilised and waiting lists have been reduced to reasonable proportions. The Mayday Eye Clinic, administered by the Hospital Service, has also benefited from this increase in facilities, so that the time before an appointment can be offered has shown a welcome reduction. Thus the 14 opportunity has been created for every child to have a consultation with an Ophthalmologist when a vision defect is first suspected, whilst retaining the right to select an optician of his choice if the provision of spectacles is ultimately recommended. Table 6.

Previous Reports (1966 page 13 1967 page 13) have drawn attention to the slow but steady increase in this serious condition, which may have long term sequelae. Although antibiotics have largely eliminated the dangers of acute infection, they have left other problems whose long term resolution is not yet clear. The audiometric standard used for the sweep test of hearing was changed in 1967 so that comparisons with earlier years are no longer valid. Despite staff changes during the year a further increase occurred in the number of sweep tests of hearing. During the last two years there has been a 42% increase in the number of tests conducted and a corresponding but less marked increase (27%) in the number of audiometric tests. This remarkable increase in productivity should not obscure the increasing work load in the Audiology Service. Defects of Heart and Circulation There was no significant change in the pattern of these defects during the year. 15 Defects of the Lungs Although the number of lung defects remained stationary in 1968, it must be remembered that the levels previously reported in 1966 and 1967 were themselves relatively high. This failure to detect any improvement despite the continued progress of smoke control schemes in the area during the last three years must be a matter for real disappointment. A national study reported in 1966 (British Journal preventive and social medicine 20 p. 1) showed that whilst upper respiratory tract infection was unrelated to the degree of air pollution, chest infections most certainly were, so that some improvement in Croydon may be confidently expected. Pulmonary tuberculosis did show an improvement upon previous figures and the number of cases of notified tuberculosis in children of school age was Pulmonary - 5 Non-Pulmonary - 0 The school population was 50,000 (approx.) so that the incidence rate of pulmonary tuberculosis per 100,000 was 10. In 1967 the rate was 16/100,000. Once again there were no deaths from tuberculosis in school children. Abdominal Defects At school medical inspections the child is only examined in the upright position which does not facilitate the examination of the abdomen. This category which was introduced relatively recently thus contains a variety of defects which themselves vary in severity. Forty-five defects were reported during the year and twice this number were referred for observation by the school medical officer (Table 3). One of the defects usually recorded in this category is pain at the time of the monthly period (dysmenorrhoea). An inquiry into the incidence of the condition carried out by the Service some two years ago showed wide fluctuations in different schools, for which no reasonable explanation was found. Unfortunately treatment of the condition is of limited value and the Superintendent Physiotherapist has conducted a critical review of the value of certain new methods which have been advocated (e.g. psychoprophylaxis). There is as yet insufficient evidence of improvement by these methods to justify the extensive provision of a treatment service for the condition but the search will continue especially in view of the recent report of the disadvantages suffered by school girls in academic examinations (The Lancet (1968) 2 p. 1386). It has long been known that industrial output can be shown to be affected by the condition, and this latest report of a similar effect upon school work presents a challenge which the School Health Service cannot ignore. Certainly there can be no justification for the fatalism with which the condition has hitherto been accepted. 16 Developmental Defects The number of these defects has fluctuated in recent years. There was a sharp rise in 1966 followed by a reduction last year. The number of defects reported in 1968 shows a return to the higher figure of two years ago. Orthopaedic Defects All categories of orthopaedic defects showed a marked decline in 1968, particularly the one described as "flat foot". This latter change may represent an alteration in recording policy rather than an improvement in foot health as a result of health education efforts in recent years. It is now realised that symptomless flat foot may not require the energetic treatment advocated in the past and this may have resulted in fewer cases being reported. Less than half the number reported in 1967 were referred for treatment last year in spite of the improved physiotherapy services, and this lends support to these tentative conclusions. Dr. Thelma Wield, school medical officer with special responsibilities for orthopaedic conditions, has drawn attention to the relative increase in physically handicapped children as fewer of them die at birth or in infancy. Clearly St. Giles' School cannot accept all of these children and, indeed, there is good evidence that many parents of handicapped children would prefer them to attend ordinary schools when this can be achieved without detriment to their educational progress. Schools in Croydon have for many years accepted children with minor physical handicaps but increasingly they may be called upon to receive the child with rather more severe orthopaedic problems. Ingenuity will sometimes be needed to ensure that an otherwise perfectly satisfactory placement is not jeopardised by an inconvenient flight of steps or an unecessarily long journey to school. Increasingly the special schools will be needed to accommodate the child who presents severe medical, physical, or educational problems. Defects of the Nervous System The number of these defects was similar to that reported in previous years, but a further slight increase (10%) was reported in the number of children known to be suffering from epilepsy. Psychological Defects Although psychological defects are an increasing proportion of the total defects found, it is likely that the true incidence is much higher than the 4.5% reported in Table 3. Possible reasons for assuming a higher real incidence were mentioned in last year's report (page 15). The most striking feature in 1968 was the quite dramatic increase (20%) in the number of defects which were referred for supervision by the school medical officers themselves. This allowed a greater total number of defects to be supervised even though the number referred for specialist treatment actually declined. 17 Thus school medical officers are now themselves supervising four times the number of psychological defects which they refer for specialist treatment. These changes are a striking testimony to the value of the in-service training which the school medical officers have been receiving in this field. Every second Monday morning throughout 1968, Dr. Crosse has met the school medical officers to discuss the problems presented by emotionally disturbed children, and these sessions have obviously given encouragement to medical officers in the Department to undertake more ambitious treatment in individual cases. The problems of drug dependence and drug experimentation have continued to capture the attention of the mass media during the year. Discussions on these problems have taken place within the Department, and facilities were again reviewed. In spite of sensational newspaper statements, there is no satisfactory evidence that either drug dependency or experimentation is yet a problem amongst Croydon school children. Nutrition In previous reports this section has been headed "height and weight" but the more general title seems preferable. The figures of average heights and weights are recorded in Table 7. Annual fluctuations in each age group make comparisons difficult, but the impression continues that, whilst the average height of older pupils remains stationary, the average weight is showing a gradual increase. This trend is rather more noticeable in girls. It is essential that both parents and children should recognise that overnutrition and inappropriate nutrition are potentially dangerous, leading to disease in middle life and, in some cases, premature death. The excessive consumption of starchy foods, sweets and sugars is particularly to be deplored. Examination of soldiers killed in the Korean War showed that young American servicemen already had the changes in the arteries of the heart which are known to be associated with disease in late middle age, whereas the young South Korean soldiers fighting alongside them showed no such changes. The conclusion that dietary factors were responsible seems inescapable. It is not easy to persuade young people to forego pleasure now in the interests of their later good health, as the health education campaign concerning smoking has shown. To persuade them that only certain amounts and certain types of an essential commodity like food should be consumed is especially difficult but a vigorous attempt must be made. Unfortunately the Weight Control Clinic supervised by Dr. Phyllis Mortimer experienced some difficulties during the year and expected weight reductions did not appear as regularly as those in the past. The whole future of the Clinic was critically reviewed but, since it obviously satisfies a real need, it was decided to continue the Clinic in a reorganised form. 18 It was a great pleasure to accept Dr. Mortimer's kind offer to undertake the weekly clinic sessions again, and the renewed success of this clinic whose methods were pioneered in Croydon, is confidently anticipated. Dr. W. Simmonds' clinics for overweight boys use rather different methods but appear to be similarly successful. These facilities were extended to further schools during the year. Dr. Simmonds concentrates upon the individual approach to dietary control and emphasises the need for active co-operation and support over a long period on the part of the child. Another aspect of inappropriate nutrition concerns not the excessive consumption of food but its ingestion at irregular times. In a highly sophisticated society this may occasionally be necessary but it is difficult to justify the inadequate meal offered to some children before they go to school in the morning. A report from the Queen Elizabeth College showed that a significant number of school children go out in the morning without breakfast or a very inadequate one of cereals or biscuits. In some cases it can be shown that the child has been without food for 18 hours by the time that the school dinner is consumed. Dr. Anne Letts comments that this practice occurs in Croydon with its consequent effect on school work. The child is frequently over-tired and goes to bed too late. The following morning the child either wakes with too little time for breakfast or with no appetite. The busy mother, perhaps herself working to a strict time schedule to meet her own commitments outside the home, has no time for the lengthy meal time that most children occas ionally require and so the child leaves for school tired and hungry, and hardly well equipped to participate to the full in the learning process. A meagre meal of biscuits or crisps (which were the subject of criticism in last year's report, see p. 16) must suffice until the school meal offers the first substantial nourishment of the day. This all too familiar story is readily preventable and its dangers deserve wider publicity. 19 Table 7 Average Heights and Weights in 1968 and Previous Years Ages Number Examined in 1968 Average Height in Inches Average Weight in lbs. 1968 1967 1966 1965 1939 1968 1967 1966 1965 1939 BOYS 5 years 1,559 43.2 43.3 43.2 43.1 41.8 43.1 44.0 43.3 43.1 41.5 6 years 592 44.2 44.2 44.2 44.5 43.8 44.6 45.0 44.7 45.3 43.4 14 years 647 65.7 64.0 63.5 64.2 59.0 114.2 115.5 113.3 117.8 90.8 15 years 607 65.8 65.6 65.6 64.9 - 123.3 122.6 121.4 119.6 - 16 years 198 67.1 67.5 66.9 66.4 - 129.5 131.4 130.0 130.1 - 17 years 28 67.5 68.1 68.6 68.3 - 134.9 135.3 137.6 137.6 - GIRLS 5 years 1,555 43.2 43.0 42.8 42.6 41.2 42.8 42.2 42.0 41.9 39.7 6 years 586 44.2 43.6 43.9 43.2 42.7 44.0 43.3 44.0 42.8 41.4 14 years 731 62.6 62.4 62.1 61.9 60.3 115.0 113.8 113.6 115.8 97.9 15 years 650 63.5 63.1 63.2 62.6 62.0 118.5 117.7 120.1 117.9 105.5 16 years 115 64.0 63.8 63.5 63.3 - 122.2 121.5 121.1 122.4 - 17 years 8 64.8 64.1 63.9 64.2 - 127.8 126.0 126.0 128.4 - 20 PART II SPECIALIST SERVICES AUDIOLOGY SERVICE Mr. J.C. Oakley, Peripatetic Teacher of the Deaf 1968 was a very busy year for the Audiology Clinic, 1,140 children were tested by pure tone audiometer, this included routine follow-up cases, cases referred by School Medical Officers and 525 Sweep Test Failures. Regular clinics were held at Lodge Road; Parkway, New Addington and Whytecliffe Road, Purley. The pre-school children requiring auditory training, were seen regularly in the clinic or at home and in some cases, extra speech training was given by the Speech Therapists. In addition, Speech Training Machines were loaned to parents, for use at home. 101 children were seen either by Mr. Parsons or Mr. Stewart, the Corporation's Consultant Otologists, who held regular sessions at Lodge Road and Kingsley Infant and Junior Partially Hearing Units. 14 hearing aids were recommended during the year, 4 of these were National Health Service 'Medresco' aids and the other 10, Commercial aids paid for by the Corporation. Commercial aids are considered necessary if the hearing loss is greater than the range covered by the 'Medresco' aid, or if there is a sharp perceptive loss in the higher frequencies. The 'Medresco' aid has no automatic volume control and cannot be tolerated by children with such a loss, as the hearing is often normal for the lower frequencies and a general amplification of sound causes a considerable amount of distortion and may become painful. The National Health Service is hoping to provide aids of this kind in the near future. 60 babies were seen at the special clinic held in conjunction with Dr. Morgan, for the early assessment of deafness in young babies, 9 of these were referred to Mr. Parsons for further assessment. This clinic has been very successful in diagnosing deafness in these very young babies, enabling a hearing aid to be prescribed and auditory training commenced with the minimum of delay. Early diagnosis and the institution of auditory training, together with a hearing aid, greatly improve the outlook for a child with impaired hearing, particularly the more severely deaf. There was a sharp increase in the number of severely deaf pre-school children, 8 new cases were discovered during the year and we have been warned by Mr. Parsons to expect a considerable number of new cases in the near future due to the recent severe rubella epidemic. During the year, all Infant schools were visited at least once, and apart from absentees and unco-operative children (479), all children newly admitted to school during the year were tested. Of the 7,118 children tested, 525 (approx. 7.4%) failed the test and were referred to the Audiology Clinic for further assessment. We were sorry to lose Mrs. Longstaff at the end of 21 the Summer term, her place has been taken by a qualified audiometrician, Mrs. Marshall. For additional Statistical details, see Appendix B, Page 59. CHILD GUIDANCE CLINIC I am grateful to Dr. C. Crosse, Consultant Psychiatrist, South West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, for the following report:â€” It is refreshing to report that our efforts over the past few years to improve team work and co-ordination at the clinic are now producing dividends. Nearly all cases referred are subjected to a multidisciplinary scrutiny before decisions of diagnosis and treatment are made. In the final analysis one often has available data from the educational psychologist, school head, social worker and day unit staff. All aspects of the child's problems are thus comprehensively covered whether the exercise is one of diagnosis or treatment. One of the most common ploys in the management of emotional disturb bance .in children is the manipulation of environment and one should emphasise here that the stronger the levers the more effective the manipulation. Having acquired through the skills of the psychologist and social worker a deep investment in the family and school environment, we are in a position to discharge effectively the clinical recommendation made at the time of referral. The clinic may be seen as just one part of a total service matrix in which other social agencies, hospital departments, family doctors and schools, have some common involvement with the family in attendance. The real fruits of this pattern of service is the awareness of the clinic staff of the considerable resources at hand, thus negating that nagging sense of impotency so often felt in clinics detached from the local professional community. Our day hospital unit continues to prosper and it is being more and more used for observation and treatment. Disturbed children are, by the very nature of their disability, severely crippled in their social relationships, and the warm therapeutic groups so ably supported by the day unit staff go a long way to restore the social confidence of these children/These remarks have particular application to children who are either excluded from school or are too sick to attend. Since the staff are fully aware of the dangers of institutionalisation there is a constant drive to return their charges to their rightful environment and long term attendance is discouraged. Although school attendance of the so called school refusal child is soon reinstated we do not lose sight of the fact that a child is not just a name on a school register and that factors underlying his school refusal should be fully understood before demands for his return are made. Experience of the day unit over the past two years has shown that it is an indispensable part of a busy child 22 guidance clinic and that it should be fully supported in terms of staff and equipment. Mere periodic outpatient consultations are just not enough for the hard core-of emotionally disturbed children seen at the day unit. A novel project initiated this year has been the development of peripheral clinics at infant welfare centres of the local health authority. With the kind permission of Dr. S.L. Wright new cases are seen at the Lodge Road clinic, New Addington and at Purley. Under ideal circumstances the children and parents are seen by a psychiatrist, and a psychiatric social worker, while the 'Cultivation of play groups at the centre is left to the staff nurse from the main day unit. These clinics are selective in that only children in the pre-infant and infant school range are seen on the well founded assumption that the earlier emotional problems are tackled the higher the therapeutic rewards. Parents offered help early do not show that despair and resignation which results from years of stress incurred by chronic neurotic interaction with their children. These new clinics also help to divert the younger age group away from a slowly expanding waiting list. Mrs. E.M. Gee, psychiatric social worker, who succeeded Miss R.M. Heller, is responsible for Lodge Road and Purley, while Miss M.S. Gradwell is responsible for the New Addington clinic. The impending appointment of an additional staff nurse to the main day unit may be seen as a welcome step towards increasing the number of admissions to the unit, thus releasing pressures on the main waiting list of the clinic. The appointment of a clerk/receptionist to the clinic has greatly improved the setting of the main business of the clinic, namely, the steady flow of outpatient consultations. A parent can now be interviewed in peace while the receptionist contains the patient and siblings in the waiting room. In conclusion it should be recorded that the clinic staff are deeply appreciative of the help and support so readily given during the year by the Croydon Health and Education Departments and the Croydon and Warlingham Park Groud Hospital Management Committee.

Everett resigned to take up a post at the Department of Education and Science. Mr. J.D. Palmer took up the post of Principal School Dental Officer in January 1969. I am grateful to Mr. Everett for the following report on the work of the Service during 1968. School Inspections During 1968 81.5 per cent of the school population received dental inspection. This welcome improvement which is an increase of 18.5% over the figure for 1967 was made possible by the increased efforts of the Dental Officers. The value of such inspections is that they draw attention to dental defects and responsible parents who are thus made aware of the need for treatment obtain it for their children either within the School Dental Service or from General Dental Service practitioners. Results of School Inspections 1967 1968. School Population 49,020 49,712 Number inspected 31,088 40,431 percentage inspected 63.4% 81.5% Number needing treatment 12,942 17,884 percentage needing treatment 42% 44.2% Number requesting S.D.S. treatment 3,805 5,355 percentage requesting S.D.S. treatment 28.5% 30% Number attending General Dental Practitioners 5,725 7,884 percentage attending General Dental Practitioners 44% 44% Number of refusals of treatment 3,412 4,645 percentage of refusals of treatment 28% 26% The above percentage figures are not an entirely true picture of the acceptance and referral rate because not all schools were inspected during the year. However, it is encouraging to note that the number of consents has apparently increased and that the number of refusals has decreased. 24 Treatment When the School Dental Service was inaugurated in 1908, the condition of school children's teeth was giving rise to considerable concern.Until the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, the Local Authority Dental Officers provided a large part of the treatment that the schoolchildren received. The greater part of each course of treatment consisted of extractions for children who might lose as many as 8 deciduous molar teeth shortly after their entry into school life. Parents generally were disinclined to agree to their children receiving treatment and were particularly opposed to the filling of teeth. Attitudes have been changing particularly in recent years and it is interesting to compare the treatment pattern for the year 1963 with that of 1968. Treatment Pattern For every hundred courses of treatment 1963 1968 Number of permanent teeth filled 50 120 " " deciduous teeth filled 18 68 " " permanent teeth extracted 15 19 " " deciduous teeth extracted 36 35 " " attendances for General Anaesthetic 21 19 " " attendances for treatment 170 270 Percentage of courses completed 49% 83% of visits for emergency treatment 6.5% 4.7% " of orthodontic cases discontinued 25% 10% Number of deciduous teeth filled for every 100 extracted 50 194 " " permanent teeth filled for every 100 extracted 330 630 Without doubt, this demonstrates a greater willingness on the part of parents to allow their children to receive treatment and on the part of children to accept that which is designed to conserve their dentition. Dental Officers now undertake more time-consuming techniques but which are of considerably greater value to the patients. From the figures below it can be seen that, while treatment is given to fewer Datients. the amount of restorage dentistry carried out is much greater. It is also encouraging to note that, whereas in 1963 one visit in 14 was for emergency treatment necessitated by pain or infection, in 1968 one visit in 20 was for this reason. Sessional treatment analysis 1963 1968 Courses commenced per session 4.0 3.0 Permanent teeth filled â€ž 2.1 3.4 Deciduous teeth filled â€ž 0.8 2.0 Permanent teeth extracted â€ž 0.6 0.6 Deciduous teeth extracted â€ž 1.5 1.0 General anaesthetics â€ž 0.9 0.6 Attendances â€ž 7.2 8.0 Courses completed â€ž 2.0 2.4 Emergencies â€ž 0.5 0.4 25 1963 1968 Appointments not kept per session 2.0 2.3 Teeth restored by crowning during the year 5 63 Staff During the year the number of Dental Officers remained unaltered, although there was a small delay between the resignation of two part-time dental officers and the appointment of a full-time dental officer to take their place. The principal school dental officer had commenced his duties as an honorary demonstrator in the children's department of the Royal Dental Hospital in October, 1967, and his successor is continuing this valuable liaison. It is also pleasant to report that another dental officer was offered, and was able to accept, the appointment of Clinical Assistant in the children's department of King's College Hospital Dental School. Connections with teaching hospitals such as these serve to keep the dental officers concerned fully aware of the latest trends in dental treatment for children, and they are able to transmit such information to their colleagues. Also, the students are made aware of the possibility of a career in children's dentistry and in this way recruitment to the School Dental Service benefits. Dental Health Education With the invaluable assistance of the Health Education Section, the programme of Dental Health Education in primary schools has been continued and extended. As before, students of the Royal Dental Hospital School of Oral Hygiene have visited infant and junior departments and have spoken to individual classes. More than 7,000 children in 18 schools have received talks this year, 2,000 more than in 1967. The girls try to involve the children in the subject by asking questions about correct diet, and individual pupils are invited to demonstrate different methods of tooth cleaning. They particularly appreciate the opportunity to make drawings about dental matters, and these are often related to their own experiences in the dental surgery. Handicapped Children It is becoming increasingly recognised that this section of the school population has as great a need of dental care as any other, and indeed greater than some because of the nature of their disabilities. Some of these children are completely unable to co-operate when dental treatment is being performed and in these circumstances all necessary fillings and extractions are performed under general anaesthesia. The School Dental Service in Croydon is fortunate to have available to it the skill of a consultant anaesthetist of the Regional Hospital Board who has wide dental experience. 26 The children's department of the Royal Dental Hospital School of Dental Surgery is initiating a service for these children and it may be that cooperation with them will bring considerable advantages to the patients. Dental statistics will be found on page 60. ENURESIS CLINIC I am grateful to Dr. Margaret White for the following report:- During 1968, 279 children attended the three Enuresis Clinics in Croydon at Lodge Road, New Addington and Purley. Owing to an increase in the number of the buzzers available, this electrical conditioning machine has been used by more children, and the waiting list for the apparatus has been cut from 6 months to about 6 weeks. The length of the waiting list still depends on the co-operation of the parents in returning the apparatus at the end of treatment. An ever greater preponderance of boys over girls is shown in these figures. Three children were referred at under 4 years, and no treatment was attempted as at this age anything more than advice to the mother is more likely to hinder than help. Five children were referred to the urogenital surgeon in cases where it seemed possible that there might be an organic cause for the enuresis. In none of the five children has any abnormality been found. Three children were referred to the Child Guidance Clinic because it was felt that their enuresis was only one symptom of a much greater emotional disturbance. Total attendance 279 Boys - 182 Girls - 97 Still attending 105 Discharged Dry 120 Discharged for non-attendance 44 Left District 6 Lodge Road Clinic 173 New Addington Clinic 63 Purley Clinic 43 Referred to Urologist 5 Referred to Child Guidance Clinic 3 Used Buzzer 90 Age (Years) 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Number in Group 4 30 48 58 37 32 25 13 12 11 5 6 SCHOOL EYE CLINICS I am grateful to Dr. Derek Clarke for the following report. Children up to school leaving age are seen at the School Eye Clinics, which are held at Purley, Sanderstead and Parkway, for various eye defects referred by local authority staff and general practitioners 27 Children requiring surgical treatment are referred from these clinics to the hospital eye service. Close liaison with the orthoptic service at the Croydon Eye Unit is maintained when the treatment can be appropriately shared. We were sorry to lose Mrs. Sandiford, who has given thirteen years' devoted service to the school eye clinics. Statistics will be found on page 61. HEALTH EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS Miss D.S. Elliott, S.R.N., H.V.Cert., D.H.E. Principal Health Education Officer Judging by the number of school children and students visiting the Health Education Section and writing in to the Health Department for information and literature about health subjects and health services, curiosity-arousing methods of teaching are stimulating an active interest in health subjects. The department's work in schools is broadening slowly and the health education staff and health visitors encourage and involve teachers in it as much as possible; their help, as always, determines the success of the work attempted. Much of the extra work done was due to the excellent help given by six health visitors who have integrated well into the school teams. The interest and co-operation of the Assistant Superintendent Nursing Officer in making this possible has been greatly appreciated. Secondary Schools One-term Community Health Courses covering all streams of children were given in the following schools:â€” 1. Ashburton Boys 9. Overbury Mixed 2. Ashburton Girls 10. Riddlesdown Mixed 3. Coloma (Lower Sixth Form) 11. Roke Mixed 4. Fairchildes Boys (Fifth Year) 12. Shirley Mixed 5. John Newnham Mixed (Third Year) 13. South Croydon Mixed 6. Lady Edridge (Fourth Year) 14. Tavistock Boys 7. Lady Edridge (Group discussion in Lower Sixth Form) 15. Taunton Manor Girls 16. Woodcote Mixed 8. Lanfranc Girls Other talks were also given by members of the Health Department at Portland, Chipstead Valley, Selhurst Girls Grammar and the High Schools. 28 Fairchildes Boys' School planned a "group teaching" approach to the Community Health Course throughout the Autumn term. Thirteen health topics were presented to about 150 fifth year boys and their masters; a further period being allowed each week for follow-up discussion in class. The staff felt the project was successful and have requested a similar programme in 1969. The master of the lower stream boys worked on the subjects before the sessions, familiarising them with the technical words involved and relating the content to their experience. Before a talk concerning one of the health hazards of today i.e. food poisoning, he arranged for the boys to look round the school kitchen and meet the staff. This was one way of making the maximum use of a guest speaker's time although discussion during the lessons was necessarily limited. One practical difficulty disturbed the continuity of the lessons. They were given in a hall with no black-out. To see films or slides the 150 boys had to take their chairs and pack themselves on to the stage; the curtains were then closed for the show to commence. Both boys and girls in many schools undertook visits of observation in connection with these courses and small groups of girls were learning while they helped to look after toddlers in some of the Corporation clinics. To widen and deepen pupils' interest in mankind the General Studies' Course for the lower sixth form at Lady Edridge Grammar School was broken down into cycles of studies each lasting about six weeks. The girls were split into small groups and completed each course in turn. The subjects included architecture, Photography, the beginnings of Greek philosophy and the social patterns and problems of present day life. As an experiment the social studies group led by a Health Education Officer approached their previously selected and prepared subjects on an informal group discussion basis and the girls were encouraged to think independently and to verify and substantiate opinions. Each week they elected a new leader and secretary and by about the third week the health education officer's role became one of observer and unobtrusive guide as the group developed the art of discussion. During the first session subjects were chosen for the following weeks so that research and preparation could be undertaken. Topics included:â€” "The changing role of women", "The illegitimate child", and "Dependence and Interdependence". B.B.C. Schools Radio and Television Programmes There is a series of four radio programmes on "Reproduction and Growth" for children in the first and second years of secondary schools. Children from Overbury, Portland and Shirley Secondary Schools visited Broadcasting House and recorded a most successful discussion with Professor Bullough for a fifth programme. 29 The Principal Health Education Officer was invited again to act as a consultant on five programmes for the series "Science Session: Health Unit" and appreciated the help and enthusiasm given by boys and girls from Ashburton Secondary School in a filmed discussion for the programme on "Smoking" and also the generous sharing of experience of social studies by the staff of Westwood Secondary School. Primary Schools "Growing Up" Talks For ten years a pattern of two evening talks, the first for parents of boys and girls and the second for mothers and fourth year daughters in primary schools has been followed. This sharing of responsibility with parents is still considered to be the most important part of the exercise. The demand for the talks is steady although only 34 out of a possible 60 schools make use of the service. There is a growing demand for either a third session for boys and fathers or the inclusion of boys in the second session. Limited staff willing and able to deal with the subject at this level, make the first suggestion impossible and the very large group that would be formed if the second suggestion were followed is not desirable especially where no teaching has been given in earlier years. Two or three schools do manage this and others could overcome the difficulty if teaching were included at eight and nine years old as suggested in the Croydon Health and Education Departments' scheme "Health Education - Patterns for Teaching". At these ages neither boys nor girls are physically or emotionally involved. They are curious and interested and can accept simple information about growth, development and families quite naturally. Visual aids for these age groups are still limited and not entirely suitable. New material is urgently needed and a request for this will be made to the newly formed Health Education Council. It was a pleasure to be able to invite teaching staff to the new Health Education Section in Taberner House (Room 3 : 16); visits from teachers are always welcomed and the Health Education staff look forward to the 1969 programmes. INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENTS Children who are not making progress in an ordinary school are referred to the School Health Service to determine whether special education may be necessary. A test of intelligence is carried out not only when there is any suggestion of educational subnormality but also during the investigation of a large number of other medical problems. 191 children were examined during 1968. The classifications arrived at, together with recommendations made, were as follows:â€” 30 (1) Found to be educationally subnormal: (a) Recommended for Day School for E.S.N. pupils 59 (b) Recommended for Residential School for E.S.N. pupils 2 (2) Found to be unsuitable for education in School 34 (3) Other Recommendations:â€” (a) Referred back to an Ordinary School 32 (b) Referred for further investigation by School Psychological Service 6 (c) Recommended for Day Special Schools for other handicaps 6 (d) Referred for Speech Therapy 8 (e) Referred for Medical Treatment 12 (f) Referred for further assessment 20 (g) Other Investigations 12 191 Awaiting assessment on 31.12.68. 32 In addition, 60 intelligence tests were given to children attending St. Christopher's Special School. A further 11 intelligence tests were given to children who were about to attend St. Giles' Special School, and a further 5 children already attending St. Giles'. PHYSIOTHERAPY SERVICE Miss J. McBride, M.C.S.P., A.P.T.A., Superintendent Physiotherapist The reorganised Physiotherapy Service has now been functioning for a year and during that time Clinics have been successfully maintained at Lodge Road, St.James's Road, Waddon, Purley, Sanderstead, New Addington and Old Coulsdon. Since we have sufficient staff it is now possible to ask a child to attend the Clinic nearest to its home; there are therapists working for the Maternity Service at Chipstead Valley, Addiscombe Grove, East Croydon and Stanley Halls in South Norwood, who are only too willing to treat any school children in those areas also. On two occasions it has not been practical for a severely burnt child to attend for treatment; this has therefore been provided on a domiciliary basis. The greater proportion of our work occurs at St. Giles' School where there are now two Senior Therapists later to be joined by an assistant. A part-timer is actively engaged in the hydrotherapy pool once a week, and 31 shortly I hope the number of hydrotherapy treatments will be increased. This is an ideal medium for mobilising the grossly disabled of which there are an increasing number. It is hoped to establish a system of regular case conferences with Dr. Wield and the appropriate physiotherapist, speech therapist, teacher and nursing sister. This will enable mutual problems to be ironed out and a more comprehensive and amalgamated treatment programme planned. We all realise the need to unite our varying disciplines. On a trial basis it has been decided that every Spina Bifida child attending St. Giles' (of which there are now thirteen of varying ages) should be visited at hone by a physiotherapist. This will enable the child and the family to be educated about the condition in its own surroundings. By doing this it is hoped to eliminate such problems as the severe burns that we find from time to time on anaesthetic limbs. This is a strangely new condition to the layman; it is not neglect that produces these disasters but misunderstanding. A domiciliary survey may help to prevent further misfortunes in the future. SPEECH THERAPY SERVICE Mr. J.R. Brook, Principal Speech Therapist The past year has been a year of change in the Speech Therapy Service. Since the arrival of the new Senior Therapist in September 1967, there has been a complete turnover of the staff in the Service. Most of this has taken place during 1968. This has inevitably caused some disruption of the service, but on the whole has been very welcome in that a completely new team is developing. Advantage has been taken of the change to encourage a slightly different approach both to the Service as a whole and to the individual child. Emphasis has been laid on avoiding bringing the young child into the clinic before speech has had a chance to right itself; similarly, therapists are encouraged to put children on to a review basis when regular weekly attendance at the clinic appears no longer necessary. In both cases the underlying reason being that children may have adverse and negative attitudes to communication confirmed and reinforced by regular attendance at the Speech Clinic. Where gradual development towards normal speech is likely to occur, reduction of parental anxiety and careful reviewing at regular intervals can show quicker results than weekly therapy. In appointing new staff, experienced therapists are rarely seen. The policy has been to accept lively speech therapists who will, it is hoped, eventually take a progressive interest in their work as a worthwhile profession and, so far as one can see, this policy may well be paying dividends. The year has been busy at the West Thornton Unit in that there has been a greater turnover of children attending the Unit. The number of children attending full or part-time at normal classes in the main part ofthe school has 32 also been increased. The very real advantage of the Unit in being so integrated into the normal school environment can hardly be stressed too much. In practice this integration often requires a great deal of sympathy and understanding from the teaching staff. The children involved may have little or no understanding of speech and an equal difficulty in expressing their needs and fears. The help of the teaching staff in this increased integration is gratefully acknowledged. The usefulness of the Speech Therapy Service to the Borough has been reduced by staff shortage. The effective level of staff during the year has been roughly six out of a required eight speech therapists. This trend is a continuation of past experience, and so far as can be seen will continue, though the situation compares well with most other London Boroughs. It is hoped that 1969 will be a more settled year, although further gradual changes are planned to increase the effectiveness of the Service. WEIGHT CONTROL CLINIC Dr. Phyllis M. Mortimer, School Medical Officer During the past year two new groups of the Weight Control Clinic have been formed and it is anticipated that a further one will be started before the year ends. As on previous occasions it has been necessary to amalgamate residual patients in different groups and, in consequence, the girls still attending the clinic have been under treatment for varied lengths of time. The original format for the meetings has been maintained. The girls are weighed and, as a group, discuss individual weight losses or gains and any problems . This is followed by some nutritional health education activity. Flannelgraphs, film strips, films and visiting speakers have all been used, and in addition, a new project has been the investigation of "taste". A series of experiments has been devised in which the girls explore the factors which influence taste and individual variations in this. The aim of these experiments has been to help them overcome problems created by the lack of sugar in their diets. As with previous groups the results have been varied, a small precentage of girls achieve a completely satisfactory weight loss, the majority manage to lose some weight, while there are a minority who fail completely. One real problem still to be overcome is that created by school holidays. Almost invariably the girls put on weight during these times, probably due to frequent "nibbling" because of boredom, combined with lack of exercise. The Weight Control Clinic does not lack applicants but there are still very many girls in need of treatment who are not referred to the Clinic in the usual way. These are youngsters whose obesity has developed since their routine eleven year old medical, and who do not seek help themselves. A method of offering help to them has still to be established. 33 My grateful thanks are due to Mrs. Hoskin who ran the Clinic so ably until I was able to return in November, and to all members of the medical, health education and administrative staffs, who have helped so much throughout the year. Weight Control Clinic Dr. W. Simmonds, School Medical Officer The clinic has continued during the past year, in its rather more streamlined form and has produced a number of rather more streamlined boys. The theory which was suggested last year that it is not only a waste of time to see boys if neither themselves nor their parents are interested has been borne out by results, and it was found that the removal from a group of those boys who merely became progressively fatter (and were quite unworried) stimulated the remainder to try harder. It is now the policy to see, at a special session, all new referrals with their parents and explain to them why weight control is important. They are then seen once a term only and more individual attention can be given to each boy. No boy is discharged from a group merely because he is unsuccessful in reducing or controlling his weight. The only cancellations are those whose parents fail to attend for a whole year and who themselves admit that they do not intend to try to control their weight. OTHER SERVICES Transport of Children to Ordinary Schools In the event of an accident or illness resulting in temporary disability, the school medical officer is asked to decide whether special transport should be provided to enable the child to attend school. Before making any recommendation careful enquiries must be made to ensure not only that the transport is justified but that the child will be able to work satisfactorily when he eventually reaches the school. A child in a leg plaster may have great difficulty in negotiating several flights of stairs in order to attend various classes during the course of the day. School medical officers recommended that special transport should be provided for 23 such children during the year. Convalescent Treatment Five children received a convalescent holiday on the recommendation of the school medical officer. These arrangements are not intended to provide annual holidays for children whose parents are unable to provide them; they are an essential part of the recuperative treatment provided for a child who has been found to be in poor general health or a child suffering from a 34 particular disability. Details of the diagnosis and periods of stay are shown in the accompanying table. Diagnosis No. of Children Period of Stay Epilepsy 2 1 week Bronchitis 1 2 weeks Emotional Disturbance 1 2 weeks Pyelitis 1 2 weeks Total: 5 Juvenile Employment Return The following numbers of children were examined by the medical officers during 1968 as to their fitness to undertake the partÂ¬time employment indicated. 1968 1967 1966 Delivery of Goods for Shopkeepers 10 28 30 Delivery of Newspapers 176 213 193 Delivery of Milk 6 6 4 Shop Assistants 106 65 76 Total 298 312 303 Provision of Milk and Meals During 1968 milk was supplied free of charge to all maintained primary schools and approximately 26,988 primary children in these schools received one third of a pint each per day. This was equal to 91% of children attending junior schools and 96% in infant schools. Free milk was discontinued to secondary school pupils (maintained and nonÂ¬maintained) from September 1968. Milk was also supplied by the Education Committee to primary children in the nonÂ¬maintained schools. Approximately 2,800 one third pint bottles per day are supplied to these schools. All milk supplied is pasteurised, and the sources of supply are subject to the approval and constant supervision of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of meals supplied to children daily during 1968 was approximately 32,600. Cost of Milk and Meals Milk and Meals cost Â£978,422. Income from payment for meals was Â£291,687, making a net cost of Â£686,735. 35 Causes of Death in School Children 1968 (uncorrected) Accidental 6 Cancer 5 Infective polyneuritis 1 Mucoviscidosis 1 Pneumonia 1 Total 14 36 PART III HANDICAPPED PUPILS There are some 690 children in Croydon who are sufficiently handicapped to warrant the provision of special educational treatment facilities. This is very similar to the number reported in 1967 (691) and suggests that the number of children requiring special facilities may be reaching a stable proportion (1.5%) of the school population. When handicapped children are ranked according to the year of birth it is interesting to note that between the ages of 6 years and 14 years the number of handicapped children in each year group is surprisingly constant (63). Of these approximately one half are educationally subnormal, and one-fifth are physically handicapped. Earlier in this Report (page 16 ) reference was made to the increasing number of handicapped school children, and it should be remembered that the majority of children with a handicap are educated in ordinary schools. No record is maintained of the number of these children, and it is a great tribute to the teachers in Croydon that such children seldom require the active intervention of the School Health Service. Nevertheless, there are many difficulties associated with the education of handicapped children in ordinary schools, and it must be recognised that in some cases admission to a special school is essential if a satisfactory educational programme for the child is to be achieved.

Fortunately interim arrangements ensured that waiting lists were not increased. In 1968, a total of 109 pupils were newly ascertained by the Education Committee as requiring special educational facilities either in special school or special units (Table 10). In all cases the medical recommendations were straightforward and the Consultant Panel did not meet during the year. The importance of early detection of handicaps so that adequate educational arrangements may be made in good time cannot be too strongly stressed, and reference has been made in the two preceding Reports to the improvements which have been made in the assessment of preÂ¬school handicapped children. A total of 177 preÂ¬school handicapped children are now known to the Service., and their likely disabilities are shown in Table 11. This represents a further increase of 21% compared with the previous year, and almost twice the number first reported in this table two years ago. Table 11 must be interpreted with extreme caution, since it is often not possible to assess the real needs of a handicapped child until he is about to enter school. Certainly not all of the children recorded in the Table will require admission to special schools or units. Nevertheless, the figures do show possible trends and provide a reasonable basis for further planning. In particular., the striking and continuing increase in the number of physically handicapped children needs close attention. The decision of the Department of Education and Science not to include the Committee's proposal for a nursery unit at St. Giles' in the 1970/71 building programme was a serious setback, and these figures clearly show the need for these facilities. The Education Committee has now submitted this project for inclusion in the 1971/72 building programme, and it is hoped that the Department of Education and Science will be able to give approval. Even so, the youngest child in this table will be at least 4H years old before any real hope of assistance can be forthcoming. It is anticipated that the early provision of intensive medical care in the educational situation of a nursery school will allow young physically handicapped children to make the kind of all round progress which would make admission to an ordinary junior school a practical possibility for the majority. At five years of age the increasing number of spina bifida children present a combination of problems which precludes their easy integration into an ordinary school. These problems can be supervised more easily and indeed resolved in a special school, so permitting the child to return to his local school at a later date with his educational progress maintained and with fewer medical problems. This ready acceptance of children who might not have been considered for admission to a special school in the past, combined with the overall absolute increase inthe number of physically handicapped children does emphasise the question whether there are sufficient places at St. Giles' School for the known and likely demand. 38 Providing Croydon adopts an increasingly restrictive policy towards the admission of children from outside the Borough, existing provision would seem to be sufficient to meet these needs.

Partially Sighted During the year four children were found to require special educational treatment in this category, and three of them were admitted to St. Luke's School. It is pleasing to report that one family moved into the area after seeing the facilities at St. Luke's School expressly so that their child could attend there. The fourth child ascertained in this category during 1968 presented many problems and his out of school care caused such difficulties that it was not possible to secure the assessment period at St.Luke's School which had been hoped. He has been admitted to a residential institution for further investigation. I am grateful to Miss J. Rundle for the following report of the work of the School during 1968. 39 St. Luke's Special School for Partially Sighted Children Throughout 1968 steady progress continued in all branches of school work. Three children have been admitted, two of infant age and the other of junior age. Following the Education Committee's re-organisation of the school for primary age children only, two children of secondary age have been transferred to other special schools. There have been many visitors to the school including teachers interested in special education, students from Colleges of Education and a group of senior pupils from a Secondary School. Good progress has been made with swimming under the patient guidance of the swimming instructor at the Central Baths. Two children have gained certificates and badges. Ball games present many problems to partiallysighted children but swimming is a sport that they are able to enjoy together without having to be part of a team. The junior children have made several educational visits which included visiting the London Museum, the London Zoo, the Royal Mews, Westminster Abbey and a trip on the River Thames to Kew. Two boys are now attending Winterbourne Junior Boys' School on a partrtime basis. Both these boys should be able to take their place in the ordinary school at secondary age. The help and interest of the Headmaster of Winterbourne Junior Boys' School is much appreciated. Mr. T.E. Davies, the ophthalmologist, visited the school twice during the year. The autumn examination was Mr. Davies last visit owing to his impending retirement. We regret this very much and wish to thank him for his helpful advice and interest in the children. Dr. J.S. Horner carried out a routine medical examination in the Autumn Term. There have been opportunities each term for the parents to visit the school. These occasions help to establish a link between home and school. The day to day contact as with parents of children in the normal school is not so easily made when children come from a wide area and often travel considerable distances.

Special School 1 Transferred to Residential Special Schools 3 Admitted during the year 3 40 DEAF AND PARTIALLY HEARING PUPILS Deaf Partially Hearing In Residential Schools 12 4 In Day Schools and Units 3 33 No child was newly ascertained as deaf during the year. Six children were found to require admission to suitable units for the partially hearing, and four of these children were admitted in 1968, leaving two children still on the waiting list. It is pleasing to record the opening in September of a fourth unit for partially hearing pupils in Croydon. This unit, at Riddlesdown Secondary School, ensures the complete provision of special facilities for partially hearing pupils throughout the whole age range. The first unit for partially hearing pupils in Croydon was opened in January 1964 and in less than five years the Committee has been able to extend its facilities to provide a comprehensive service throughout school life. All this provision has been achieved against a background of sudden and unexpected demand coupled with a chronic shortage of experienced, trained teaching staff. The appreciation of all those in the School Health Service concerned with this work, to the members of the Education Department who have made such rapid progress possible is very warmly recorded. 52 deaf or partially hearing pupils are at present placed in the following special schools or units, and this represents an increase of 13% compared with the previous year, and the highest figure yet recorded in Croydon. Twenty of these children are now of secondary age, and a further four children living outside Croydon attend day units provided by the Corporation.

Regular visits have been made by myself to these Units throughout the year to observe the progress and supervise the general health of the children. Mr. Parsons (Consultant Otologist) has also visited each of the Units once a year. These visits provide a most useful opportunity for each child to be discussed individually by Mr. Parsons with the teacher concerned; Mr. Oakley; the parent (if present); and myself. Three of the older children (11 + years) left the Junior Unit in July last, and are now continuing their education at the Unit which opened in September 1968 at the Riddlesdown County Secondary School. In all these Units, every effort is made by the teaching staff to integrate these children with the normal hearing children, both in the classroom and playground". I am grateful to the Chief Education Officer who has provided the following reports on the work of the partially hearing Units. Partially Hearing Unit for Nursery Children, Kingsley Infants' School There are se ven children in the Unit ranging in age between three and five years. Three children moved up into the Infant Unit in September and there was an entrant of one girl. One girl was admitted towards the end of November. The children integrate with the hearing Nursery children for their dinner and this has provided them with valuable experience of appreciation of the school environment and of the children contained within it. The children are taught along Nursery methods of education whereby free play is interspersed with group activities affording opportunities for language and social experiences. They are given number experience and most of them have a good recognition of number up to eight. They are also given the rudiments of writing. Two of the children are giving spontaneous speech in the form of intelligible words and short phrases. The other children are beginning to vocalize and are definitely watching for speech. The children are given experience of amplified sound by the usage of the loop induction system and speech trainer. Most of the parents of the children are obviously very interested in all that the children do and co-operate readily. 42 Partially-Hearing Unit for Infant Children, Kingsley Infants' School Three children entered the Infants' Class from the Nursery in September and two children left, one being transferred to Portley House, Caterham, and the other moving up to the Junior Unit. A 5Â½ year old boy entered the class towards the end of September from a normal school. This brings the roll of the Infants' Unit to ten (three girls and seven boys ranging in age from 5 to 7 years). The boy who entered the class towards the end of September has a partial hearing loss and benefits greatly from almost complete integration into a hearing class. Four of the other more severely deaf children integrate for daily periods of 30-45 minutes into hearing classes containing children of their own age and ability range. This is mostly for the purposes of social integration and has proved to be of considerable value in the establishment of independence and communication with hearing children. The class varies in its ability. One group, consisting of five children is at the stage of spontaneous vocalisation which is not always intelligible. The children in this group are, however, watching for speech and attempting to copy the sounds given to them. The other group, of four children, are giving spontaneous speech in the form of two or three word phrases and making attempts at simple conversational patterns of speech. They are beginning to utilise reading to help sort out their problems. Individual speech work is done with all the children on the speech trainer and small groups of children are taken for work on the loop system and group aid. The children are encouraged to utilise anything that interests them for speech and language purposes. In this way much of their environment is explored. The children are progressing quite favourably with their academic working, attempting number and writing experiences pertaining to their individual levels of development. CoÂ¬operation is received from about six of the children's parents who help to provide "talking'' material by writing about the children's experiences in home noteÂ¬books. Partially Hearing Unit, Kingsley Junior School Until September there were eight fullÂ¬time pupils in this Unit and one girl attending two mornings a week. Three were then transferred to Riddlesdown School when the new secondary unit was opened and one moved out of the area. The admission of two new pupils, one of whom was transferred from the Infant Unit, brought the number on roll to six. Two are in the 7-8 year group, one is 9 and three are 10 - 11 years. In addition to mixing with hearing children at playtime and dinner-time all join other classes in the school for practical activities. The average integration at the present time is 20% of their school day but the amount and 43 type is kept under constant review. The partially-hearing children are accepted quite happily in other classes and this integration has helped considerably in their social development. Progress in reading and number has been maintained and in some cases greatly increased. It has been necessary to use much time on individual auditory training, speech and language work. This has partially offset difficulties caused by insufficient use of bodyÂ¬worn aids outside the "Unit when in an environment of meaningful sound. Tribute must be paid to those parents who do undertake such activities as programmes of interesting visits and generally give special attention to speech and language. Potential speech production tests show a very satisfactory level of proficiency (2 children 100%). The Junior Unit, like the other Partially-Hearing Units at Kingsley School has been helped considerably by the National Deaf Children Society. Opportunity has been taken to extend the use of visual aids and recorded sound and to add to the wide range of books and apparatus so necessary to help the children progress according to their individual needs and abilities. Partially Hearing Unit, Riddlesdown Secondary School Three boys from Kingsley Junior School and one girl from Holman Hunt Junior School, all of first year secondary age, came to the Unit on September 16th. With perhaps one exception, these children have settled down quickly and are obviously happy and stimulated in their new surroundings. They integrate with the hearing pupils for dinners, playtime, P.E. and all practical subjects. The girl is now also integrating for Maths. This amounts to 35% for boys and 47% for the girls. This integration is spread between three different classes, thus allowing much individual tuition on language, speech and reading in the Unit. This is essential owing to the range of hearing loss, reading ability, etc. within the group. Science, History, Geography, Religious Instruction and Maths are being tackled, but progress is unavoidably hindered due to language difficulties. It is hoped that the children will be integrated in these subjects by their second year, if not before. There are three other children attached to the Unit. A 13 year old boy placed in Form 1D, a 14 year old girl placed in 3B and a 12 year old girl in 2C. These three were already in the school, and come to the Unit for individual speech training each week. A check is also kept on their general progress and well-being. They, like the others, seem very happy. The Unit is acoustically fitted, and makes use of projector, tape recorder and a small language laboratory. The latter is used mostly for speech training at present. This will later be expanded to other lessons as and when the pupils are ready. 44 A visit was made to New Cross Hospital for renewal of ear moulds on the 18th October. The Unit enjoys a very good relationship with the staff and children in the school and it is hoped this will continue. EDUCATIONALLY SUBNORMAL PUPILS In Day Special Schools 256 In Residential Special Schools 20 Awaiting Placement 56 During the year 54 children were ascertained as educationally subnormal in Croydon, and, although this number accounts for over half of all the handicapped pupils who were found to be in need of special education in 1968, it is still much less than in previous years. Evidence was produced in last year's Report (page 39) which suggests that head teachers may not be putting forward children in this category because of current waiting lists. During the last three years the waiting list for available places has remained at approximately 50 and, although many useful interim arrangements have been devised to ensure that the number does not increase much above this figure, it is inevitable that Head Teachers should regard such a list as a major deterrent in putting forward children for possible admission to special schools. It has been pleasing to note the commencement of building operations at the site of the new St. Nicholas School, but the date of its actual opening is awaited with increasing anxiety. Nothing is more distressing to a child than repeated failure, and from the comments of some head teachers it is evident that despite their constant and sustained efforts, this sense of failure becomes all too apparent in the children who need this special type of provision so urgently. In contrast the progress of children who have been admitted to St. Christopher's School has been most pleasing, resulting in dramatic improvements in their approach to school subjects and in their general behaviour. I am grateful to Mr. R.G. Grice for the following report. St. Christopher's Special School for Educationally Subnormal Children (1) Statistics Boys Girls Total Number on Roll 31st December, 1967 135 89 224 Admitted during 1968 41 26 67 Left to work at 16 years 15 13 28 Transferred to other areas 6 6 12 Transferred to P.H. School - 1 1 Transferred to Secondary Modern Schools 1 3 4 Transferred as unsuitable for education in school 4 1 5 Roll 31st December, 1968 150 91 241 45 (2) A mobile classroom was erected during the Christmas Holiday and brought into use at the beginning of this year. This has enabled us to take in another 18 younger children. The classroom is an excellent structure and is very comfortable to work in. (3) Flooding of the Lower Hall Gymnasium As a result of Storms during the week ended 14-15th September, the Lower Hall was badly flooded. The pressure of flood water has badly damaged the floor and as a result the Hall will not be usable for several months. This means that no indoor P.E. is possible in the School itself, but by kind cooperation of the Head Mistress of St. Luke's School for Partially Sighted Children the Junior children are able to use the gymnasium there on two afternoons per week, while the Principal of Croydon Technical College has kindly accommodated the Senior children on 3 afternoons weekly at The Annexe. We are very thankful to them. During wet dinner hours, however, the children have to be accommodated in their classrooms and this has placed an added strain on the teaching staff, who are having to undertake extra duties because of this. (4) Thank You - (a) To the Members of the Staff of Telephone House, Croydon, who again visited the school during the Christmas period and brought Decorations and a Present for each child. We are very grateful to them for their kindness. They in turn were delighted with the letters of thanks which they displayed on the Notice Boards in the Staff Canteen. (b) To the Local Branch of the National Association for Mentally Handicapped Children, who provided us with a complete new set of Stage Curtains. These will be a great asset and will help in our drama productions. (c) To the Junior Chamber of Commerce for London, who took sixty of our children to Worthing for the day on Saturday, June 29th. (5) Sporting Activities (a) Swimming. The following Certificates have been obtained during the past year - Distance No. Obtained Boys Girls 20 yards 24 13 11 50 yards 36 18 18 100 yards 32 18 14 Â¼ mile 8 5 3 Â½ mile 7 4 3 46 (b) The past year has seen at our instigation closer relationships in Sporting and Social Activities between the Special Schools in the area, viz. - this School, St. Christopher's Mitcham, St. Nicholas Redhill, Halstead Place, Carew Manor, and St. Nicholas West Wickham. Regular fixtures have beer held in Soccer, Netball, Swimming and Cross Country Running, Cricket and Rounders, and a continued full programme is planned for the future. Social Evenings have been held too, including a Barbecue. In connection with these functions we are finding transport a problem and will have to consider approaching some philanthropic organisation to help in providing the school with a mini bus, as we feel that these functions are so important to the development of these children. The Old Scholars Club has continued to flourish. A pleasing feature during the year has been the willingness of parents to volunteer in helping to run the Club, and this has been greatly appreciated by all concerned. (6) Events (a) The School Sports were held at the Barclays Bank Sports Ground, London Road, Norbury, on Tuesday, July 2nd. (b) The School was open for Parents and Friends on Wednesday, July 17th. (c) The School Harvest Festival was held on Thursday, October 3rd. Owing to the fact that the large Hall was unusable this year, the Service had to be held in the Dining Room and also in two sessions due to lack of space. For the same reason, we could not invite parents to join us as we usually do. The Festival, however, was very successful and as a result seventy-two parcels of foodstuffs were delivered by children to old and needy people in the area. (7) Visit to Canterbury During the week ended, September 19th-20th, fourteen pupils and two members of the Staff travelled to Canterbury for the weekend as guests of the Canterbury Corps of the Salvation Army. The invitation was extended as a result of a tape recording of our last Carol Service being played at a Music Course for Teachers of Handicapped Children. On the Saturday, the children visited the Cathedral, the Westgate, the Royal Museum, and Roman Pavement before attending the Canterbury Young People's Harvest Supper. On the Sunday, the School band accompanied the Hymns, while others sang or played solos, and/or quartets or read the lessons. 47 The children were billeted in private homes and spent a most memorable weekend. It proved to be a social experiment of great value. (8) The Parents Association has continued to meet and function successfully during the year and a full programme of talks by and discussions with experts on a variety of subjects has been carried out. (9) On November 29th, Mrs. G.F. Hawker, the School Clerical Assistant, retired from a post which she had held for twenty-two years. Apart from her efficiency and extreme loyalty she was extremely popular and much loved by both pupils and staff. On November 27th, at a function held in the school, she was presented with a rocking chair in appreciation of our esteem and thanks, and we all wish her a long and very happy retirement. EPILEPTIC PUPILS In Day Special Schools 6 In Residential Special Schools 5 During the year one epileptic child was recommended for placement in a special school. Wherever possible. Head Teachers are encouraged to allow an epileptic child to remain in an ordinary school, but the disturbance occasioned to other pupils by an epileptic attack, and the educational problems presented by prolonged medication sometimes make it impossible to achieve this ideal. It has been usual for some years to recommend that, when special difficulties arise, the epileptic pupil should be admitted to St. Giles' School. MALADJUSTED PUPILS In Day Unit 34 In Day Special Schools 3 In Residential Special Schools 44 Awaiting placement 4 The incidence of maladjustment is notoriously difficult to estimate; the report of the Committee cm Maladjusted Children which was published in 1956 gave figures varying between 5.4% and 11.8% based on its own research investigations. Even the term "maladjusted" is difficult to define and in many cases is merely a reflection of the clinical judgement of the psychiatrist concerned, The number of children who receive treatment at child guidance clinics is rather less than 1%. During 1964 in England and Wales approximately 7/1000 school children received such treatment, but there were wide variations in different parts of the country, probably related to the availability of consultant psychiatrists in different regions. Thus in South Eastern England twice 48 the proportion of school children received appropriate treatment compared with the proportion in the West Midlands or in the Lancashire/Cheshire conurbation. The number of children who are recommended for special educational treatment is a very small proportion of those who attend child guidance clinics. Again, the number ascertained varies in different regions of the country, the highest proportion being in the Metropolitan area with rates between two and five times greater than in areas north and west of the river Trent. Thus approximately 1.2/1000 school children are thought to be in need of special educational treatment in England and Wales. The position in Croydon does not entirely reflect these national trends. Dr. Crosse's report (page 21) shows that only 6.2/1000 school children received treatment at the child guidance clinic last year, and after allowing for the different years under review, this is lower than the national figure. Undoubtedly the relatively long waiting lists at the clinic are a factor but by no means the only one. A national review of child guidance clinic waiting lists by the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Education and Science showed that the average waiting time is approximately six months, but in some areas is as long as 18 months. Moreover, the Croydon clinic does operate a priority system so that children with really acute problems can be seen within a few days. There remain some children who receive child guidance treatment from hospitals and clinics outside the area, usually without our being informed unless the need for special educational treatment has arisen. In 1968 fifteen children were newly ascertained as maladjusted and recommendations were made for their admission to residential schools. The number of children now requiring special educational treatment in this category in Croydon shows an increase of 25% in the last two years, but is still less than 1/1000 school children. Not only is this less than the national average, but it is less than half the number in the South Eastern Region and little more than a third of that in the Metropolitan Region. It is reasonable to enquire whether this represents some deficiency in the detection of maladjusted children. This seems unlikely and the figures appear to reflect the ascertainment policies in Croydon. Children are usually "ascertained" only when the need for admission to a residential school becomes essential, and it has been emphasised in previous reports that this decision i s more usually made as the result of the child's behaviour upon the school than upon the need to use residential facilities as a means of treatment of the child's basic difficulties. Croydon is fortunate in the steadily increasing range of day facilities which have been developed within the Borough, and this work will receive added impetus when the Committee's new Sir Cyril Burt School for maladjusted children is opened. Already children can be accommodated at the Tutorial Class when educational difficulties predominate, and admission to 49 the Day Hospital Unit at the Child Guidance Clinic allows quite severely disturbed children to receive appropriate treatment on a day basis. In the absence of these facilities, many more children would find their way into residential schools. Moreover, the day facilities themselves are largely made possible by the availability of hospital beds at Queen Mary's Hospital under the direction of Dr. Crosse. The opportunity for inpatient hospital treatment allows relatively sick children to be treated on a day basis in the certain knowledge that, should it become necessary, skilled inpatient care can be provided. Provision for the older, adolescent school child remains a problem. Dr. Crosse represented the Department at meetings organised by the London Boroughs Committee to consider ways in which the needs of these children could be emphasised. Adolescents have many problems and those who become mentally disturbed may be unsuitable for admission either to a hospital for children or to the wards of a mental hospital for adults. Special units would seem to be the logical solution, but require much careful thought to avoid the difficulties which they can themselves create. PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED PUPILS In Day Special Schools 122 In Residential Special Schools 8 During the year 13 physically handicapped children were recommended for admission to suitable special schools, and all of them were admitted. Reference has already been made in this Report to the increasing number of physically handicapped children (page 36) and to the need to provide special educational facilities for the younger child (page 37). It is now clear that the admission of increasing numbers of more severely handicapped children to St.Giles' is not without its problems. The school was not originally designed to accommodate children in wheelchairs, so that numerous practical difficulties arise. The uneven surfaces of the corridors, the width of passage ways, and the presence of heavy doors all create hazards for the young child manipulating a wheelchair over longer distances for the first time in his life. Toilet arrangements need especial thought, since many of the more handicapped children are also incontinent. It must be admitted that only a major reconstruction of the school can provide a realistic solution to these problems, and the Committee's decision to provide an entirely new Primary Unit at the time that the Nursery Unit is constructed is most welcome. It is hoped that the Department of Education and Science will endorse these far sighted proposals. In addition to improved buildings, revised staff attitudes are also necessary if these children are to learn to overcome their handicaps. The increased attention to these problems by the physiotherapy staff is welcome, and the 50 Superintendent Physiotherapist has written about some of the unsolved treatment problems in an Appendix to this Report (page 68). The need for teamwork by all concerned with handicapped children is also stressed. I am grateful to Mr. D.B. Pettman for the following report:â€” St. Giles' Special School for Physically Handicapped and Delicate Children This year has been a particularly active one for the school and has seen the fruition of many plans on the educational side. The C.S.E. Examination is now firmly established and this year eleven candidates were entered offering a total of 44 subject entries. The results were very pleasing, the candidates gaining 8 Grade 1 and 10 Grade 2 marks between them and the average grade being 3.1. Thanks to the generosity of the St. Augustine's Group, who provided funds for the purchase of a language teaching system, the school has started lessons in French. A splendid effort by the ladies of the South Norwood and Addiscombe Inner Wheel provided funds for the purchase of an 8mm Loop Projector and a Stereo Record Player. Both these items will bring added interest and realism to lessons. A combined effort by the Parents' Association and the Variety Club of Great Britain resulted in the School being presented with a 20 seater Minicoach fitted with ramp for wheelchairs together with a garage to house the coach. This has given the opportunity for all children attending school to get out and about on educational visits to museums, works, theatres, etc. The school has been re-wired and the provision of electric power outlets in all classrooms has enabled the audioÂ¬visual aids to be used throughout the school. A further improvement has been the additional tarmac play space. This was much needed and it is now possible for the various groups to play without interference. Alterations have been carried out to the toilets resulting in improvement in facilities for wheelchair cases. There are 166 children on roll. During the year 24 leavers and 15 admissions. 5 of the new children were Spina Bifida cases. At routine medical inspections carried out by Dr. Wield, 350 children were seen and 121 parents were present. Special medical inspections were held by Dr. Robson, Dr. Fanthorpe and Mr.MacQueen and 63 children were seen, 41 parents present. The School Nursing Sister and her staff were responsible for the preparation and follow-up of these examinations, the maintaining of records and the treatment of minor ailments in addition to dealing with 40 major epileptic fits and toilet training of 28 children. The Physiotherapy Department was subject to some disturbance during this year. 51 PUPILS SUFFERING FROM A SPEECH DEFECT In Day Special Schools or Units - 10 The Day Special Unit for Speech Disordered Children at West Thornton School continued to make progress during the year. It is pleasing to record that on the third anniversary of its opening no Croydon child was attending a residential school by reason of a speech defect. This is surely sufficient testimony to the Education Committee's decision to provide day facilities for these children. Dr. Gwen Fisher, Specialist medical officer responsible for speech disorders, comments - "This Unit was started in January 1966 to provide education for children with speech and communication difficulties. The time-table is arranged so that children can have daily speech therapy, and the teacher and speech therapists work together in close coÂ¬operation. The Unit is visited each term by the Consultant Neurologist, Dr. WorsterDrought, and occasionally by Mrs. DaviesÂ¬Eysenck, Educational Psychologist, who specialises in children with speech and communication disorders. Eighteen different children have been in the Unit for some time since it started three years ago. Of these, two came from John Horniman School, and three were on the waiting list for the John Horniman or Moor House Schools. Of the six children who have left the Unit, four have been able to go on to ordinary Infant or Junior schools. One child was transferred to St. Christopher's and one left the district after attending for a few weeks only. Speech therapy has continued to be given in the school and 1,131 treatments were given, 23 cases reviewed and 21 initial assessments made.

Before they leave they are gradually integrated into one of the classes at West Thornton School so that they are accustomed to normal school life. There will, however, be the occasioned child who will need further special education." I am grateful to the Chief Education Officer for the following report- Unit for Speech Disordered Children at West Thornton Primary School For most of the year the Unit has had its full complement of twelve children, two new boys being admitted in the Autumn term. At the present time the remaining twelve children may be grouped as follows:â€” Three have no intelligible speech at all; three have a certain amount but it is difficult to interpret - even by those who know the children well; three have a fair amount of intelligible speech and three speak almost normally. In addition three children have little or no comprehension of spoken language and one has great difficulty in understanding speech. This indicates that there has been an increase in the number of very severely handicapped children in the Unit. The need to develop, on an experimental basis, a special language programme for use with these children is seen by the teacher and senior speech therapist as the main priority during the present school year. Three of the less handicapped children are working for a limited period each day in the Junior School and two children now spend the whole day with normal classes of their own age group, returning to the Unit for speech therapy. This is made possible by the continued co-operation of the staff and children of West Thornton School whose kindness not only creates confidence in those children who are able to work in normal classes but also provides a very real incentive for those who are not yet ready to do so. Miss Evans, the teacher in charge of the Unit, has obtained secondment to a Course and her place has been taken very ably by Miss Fenn who brings considerable knowledge and experience to the task. DELICATE PUPILS In Day Special Schools 38 In Residential Special Schools 4 Awaiting Placement 5 During the year nine children were found to be delicate and recommended for admission to a suitable special school. This is the smallest number ever recorded in Croydon, and the number receiving special educational treatment in this category is similarly the lowest yet reported. Comments in previous Reports suggesting that this category could be discontinued seem fully to be confirmed. 53 HOME TUITION If a child is not fit to attend any school, arrangements are made for home tuition. Wherever possible such children are returned to a school as quickly as possible, since it is recognised that social contact with other children is an essential part of normal child development. During the year eleven children were recommended for home tuition, and a further two children were already receiving such tuition. UNSUITABLE FOR EDUCATION IN SCHOOL Thirty children were ascertained as unsuitable for education in school under Section 57 of the Education Act, 1944 (as amended by the Mental Health Act, 1959). Of these children 23 had never previously attended a maintained school, and four had failed to make progress despite a prolonged trial at St. Christopher's School. All the children were referred to the Health Committee and they were subsequently offered places in the various local Training Centres or, in some cases, admitted to hospital. Five children who had been ascertained previously as unsuitable for education in school were reviewed under Section 57A of the Education Act, 1944 (as amended). In four cases it was found that the child was still unsuitable for education in school but the fifth child had made some improvement and was recommended for a trial at St. Christopher's School. The Committee therefore concluded that the child was now suitable for education in school and varied the previous decision accordingly. 54 PART IV STATISTICAL RETURNS APPENDIX A STATUTORY TABLES Number of pupils on registers of maintained primary and secondary schools (including nursery and special schools) in January 1969, as in Forms 7, 7M, and 11 Schools 50,945 PART 1. - MEDICAL INSPECTION OF PUPILS ATTENDING MAINTAINED PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS (INCLUDING NURSERY AND SPECIAL SCHOOLS) TABLE A - PERIODIC MEDICAL INSPECTIONS Age Groups Inspected (By year of Birth) No. of Pupils Inspected PHYSICAL CONDITION OF PUPILS INSPECTED Pupils found to require treatment (excluding dental diseases and infestation with vermin) Satisfactory Unsatisâ€¢ factory for defective vision (excluding squint) for any other condition recorded at Part II Total individual pupils No. No. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) 1964 and later 265 264 1 6 30 35 1963 3,558 3,554 4 117 486 565 1962 1,407 1,405 2 77 235 284 1961 223 223 - 13 34 41 1960 1,742 1,742 - 146 264 374 1959 2,163 2,163 - 185 393 529 1958 949 948 1 89 159 228 1957 311 311 - 43 54 91 1956 2,368 2,368 - 331 501 750 1955 1,125 1,125 - 155 227 352 1954 1,739 1,739 - 197 426 580 1953 and earlier 1,948 1,946 2 358 414 682 TOTAL 17,798 17,788 10 1,717 3,223 4,511 Col.

Miss Jean McBride, M.C.S.P., A.P.T.A., Superintendent Physiotherapist 1. Introduction The tenor of physiotherapy over the past twenty years since the inauguration of the National Health Service has considerably altered both in terms of the types of patients and the conditions which are treated. The case load is larger, the referrals are earlier and the periods of hospitalisation are shorter; the continuing shortage of staff emphasises that skilled man-power must not be wasted. New ideas have been developed and recognised in their practical application, with the result that the approach of present day therapists has become much more flexible. The main emphasis of our work still lies in the rehabilitation field uniting our discipline with those of the Speech and Occupational Therapists. There is an urgent need for us all to think in terms of neurophysiological principles, to provide ourselves with a rationale for every procedure that we undertake, to adapt to each others' and patients' needs, and perhaps most important of all continually to assess our efforts. There must be a common end obtained by the co-operation of a heterogeneous collection of skill each working through its own discipline. It is only by so doing that it will be possible to ensure that the therapists' time is being used most effectively. 2. What is Physiotherapy today? In the past patients expected to receive passive treatment such as massage, heat, diathermy, wax and then perhaps to be encouraged to perform specific exercises relative to their condition. Today, we do not demand voluntary motor response from our patients; we do not encourage them to use their heads to run their muscles, because in treatment we can make use of the inborn reflex control of muscles for movement and posture. In the past the major emphasis of our treatment was placed upon the motor side of the nervous system. This was a natural error because it is readily seen and recorded. However, it is now known that the motor side does not learn, it is only the sensory side that can be conditioned. These fundamental changes in emphasis indicate a need for re-education of both professional staff such as Doctors and Nurses, as well as patients and their relatives. 3. Reasons for the Changing Pattern of Physiotherapy The physiotherapy profession sorely lacks teaching on the normal patterns of human growth and on the development of the child, the adolescent, the adult and the ageing; likewise physical and vocational considerations appropriate at each level. In general our knowledge is based on the 69 abnormal occurrences of these ages. One of the side effects of the decline in infant mortality is that an increased proportion of multi-handicapped children has been thrown into the lap of Society for attention. These lives will demand more therapists' time, more Schools in which to educate them, and more highly skilled personnel to care for them. It is a bleak prospect for the parent of such a child who is looking for expert treatment for we physiotherapists have not considered our limited knowledge against these enlarging horizons. We must train ourselves to think scientifically and to encourage learning whilst we work. It is only by so doing that the therapists of tomorrow will be prepared for greater responsibilities. 4. Basic Principles of Different Techniques now in Use. During the last twenty-five years several new therapeutic approaches have been devised and satisfactorily put into practice. Dr. Rabat and Miss Knott working in California discovered that by applying maximum resistance to weak muscles they became stronger when moved in a mass pattern. For example, it is a familiar sight to see a man walking along a street with a dropped foot. The muscles that help to support the foot horizontally are weakened perhaps through paralysis or disease and therefore he wears a brace to prevent tripping at every step. Treatment is given to the whole of his legs, that is, the virtually normal hip and knee as well as the weakened foot muscles. It is by this method that the strong normal muscles can assist the weaker ones to develop. This technique known as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation may be likened to running across a field as fast as humanly possible, then suddenly running faster than is normally possible because of a bull in full pursuit. It is that extra impetus that makes for the improvement during treatment. Professor Rood (a trained physiotherapist, speech and occupational therapist) also working in the United States, realised that the majority of all our treatment was concentrated on to the muscles and nerve pathways and not on the skin that surrounded them. The skin in fact is a valuable medium for re-educating parts that are not functioning normally. Stroking with an ice cube on the skin over the lower back does influence the working of a bladder; massaging with a vibrating brush does alleviate the pain of shingles; slow manual stroking given very slowly down the spine does assist the process of sleep. The realisation that the skin all over the body has different areas for reception purposes has considerably opened up our fields of treatment. Doctor and Mrs. Bobath, a neuro-physiologist and his physiotherapist wife working in England mainly with the cerebral palsied, have placed the main emphasis of their treatment on to specific positioning of the body and limbs. Muscles which are extra tight are placed in such a posture that the tightness relaxes. Parents are shown the value of doing this at home, explanations are given of the treatment and little by little the treatment programme progresses. 70 All of these different principles of treatment have a tendency to converge; it is hoped that they are not ignored, violated or even dismissed. All too often we do not consider what is happening to our patients as we physically handle them. 5. General Considerations involved in the Application of these Principles to the Case Load of the School Health Service. The majority of cases in the School Health Service for which rehabilitative procedures are devised come within the bounds of Spina Bifida, Cerebral Palsy, the brain damaged child with varying degrees of neuromuscular dysfunction, and long term Orthopaedic cases. A brain that is injured after maturity is very different from a brain that is injured during its development. Physiotherapists are so involved with the functional aspect of their patients' treatment, that the developmental process which after all is the foundation, is completely forgotten. Sometimes the best treatment for severely handicapped Spina Bifida and Cerebral palsied children is limited to the provision of tailor-made appliances and specific training in feeding and dressing; particular skilled motor function is not the most desirable objective. In such cases we frequently ask our patients to perform the impossible. Many of the reflexes and built-in motor patterns which form the basis of willed movement follow a definite pattern of development. This realisation is important because either by stimulating or suppressing these reflexes we are given a means of influencing abnormal conditions of the body. Relative to cerebral palsy and spina bifida, abnormal reflex activity prevents the retraining of normal movement. We all recognise the wild, uncontrollable gestures of spastic children and feel inadequate that neither they nor we can control them in order to make their appearance socially presentable. Finally, when considering what type of treatment a patient should receive, the value of repeated assessment deserves greater emphasis. Physiotherapists must become critical evaluators and routinely acquire the correct information from the examination of a patient. What amount of tightness is present in a muscle? What awareness is there of feeling? What developmental level has been physically reached? What involuntary movements are present? What types are they? Is the demand for stimulus or suppression and in what order? Those are the questions we should ask ourselves in order to plan a treatment programme. 6. Integrated Approaches with Speech and Occupational Therapy The nervous system, the muscular system and the feeling side of the body functions as a whole; therefore a particular therapist must be aware of the problems outside her specialised field. It is known that incapacity of limb movements hinders normal speech development. When special postures are adopted in treatment to release tightness of the limbs, 71 assistance is immediately given to the power of speech for one process influences the other. Speech Therapists must know our aims and we must know theirs in turn. It is always sensations that are being learnt by the patient, not movements as we all tend to imagine. The aim must be to achieve an integrated approach to treatment and to provide a supplement to the work of our colleagues. Emphasis must be laid on two factors involved with motor learning. Firstly, that motor learning follows inherent developmental sequences and secondly, that it is influenced by the control of sensory stimulation. All of the work of physiotherapists, speech and occupational therapists is involved in this knowledge. 7. Summary All ancillary professions are aware of the paradox of medical progress in which established medical problems are eradicated only to be replaced by new ones. Likewise in physiotherapy, some established patterns of treatment (like artificial stimulation of muscles by means of electricity) disappear, and others are by force of necessity, developed. There is a natural reluctance to admit this change and there is marked hesitancy by us to move forwards. Vast strides have been made in therapeutics and surgery with the result that physiotherapy has been made dispensable; we fail to enjoy these advances however, and there is almost apprehension amongst us that this state of affairs does exist. Neurophysiologists have made a great laboratory of knowledge available to us and with this synthesis of procedures we are advantageously placed for further professional development. Physiotherapists must discover the rationale for everything they do, then they will not be technicians but skilled and resourceful therapists.
